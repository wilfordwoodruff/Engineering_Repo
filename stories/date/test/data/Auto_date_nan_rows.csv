<p>CHAPTER VI.<br/>
DESCRIPTION OF [[Vinalhaven, Waldo County, Maine|VINAL HAVEN]]—POPULATION AND PURSUIT <br/>
OF THE PEOPLE—GREAT VARIETY OF FISH—THE IN-<br/>
TRODUCTION OF THE GOSPEL.</p>

<p>THE town of Vinal Haven includes both [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North]] and [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South <br/>
Fox Islands]], in lat. 44° north, and long. 69° 10' east. <br/>
The population numbered, at the time of my visit, about <br/>
1,800.  The inhabitants were intelligent and industrious, and <br/>
hospitable to strangers. They got most of their wealth and <br/>
living by fishing. The town fitted out over one hundred <br/>
licensed sailing vessels, besides smaller craft.</p>

<p>North Fox Island is nine miles long by two miles in width <br/>
and had a population of 800. They had a post office, one <br/>
store, a [[Baptist|Baptist]] church and meeting-house, four school-houses<br/>
and a tide grist mill.</p>

<p>The land was rather poor, yet there were some good farms. <br/>
The products where wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and grass. <br/>
The principal timber was fir, spruce, hemlock and birch. <br/>
Raspberries and gooseberries grew in great abundance, and <br/>
some up-land cranberries were raised. The principal stock of <br/>
the island were sheep.</p>

<p>South Fox Island comes as near being without any definite <br/>
form as any spot on earth I ever saw. It would be difficult <br/>
for any person to describe it. It is about ten miles in length <br/>
by five in width, and is one universal mass of rocks, formed <br/>
into shelves, hills, and valleys, and cut up into necks and points <br/>
to make room for the coves and harbors that run through and <br/>
through the island.</p>

<p>The population was 1,000. The inhabitants got their living <br/>
entirely by fishing. There is no chance for farming upon the <br/>
island, and but a few garden patches, which are cultivated at <br/>
great expense. Some few sheep are raised there.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants fish in the region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], <br/>
and bring their fish home and cure them on flakes and prepare</p>",

<p>them for the market. They supply the market with great <br/>
quantities of cod, mackerel and boxed herring.</p>

<p>Upon this [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|island]] there were two stores, three tide saw mills, <br/>
six school houses and a small branch of the [[Methodist|Methodist]] church, <br/>
presided over by a priest.</p>

<p>What timber there is upon this island, such as pine, fir, <br/>
spruce, hemlock and birch, and the whortleberries, rasp-<br/>
berries and gooseberries, mostly grow out of the <br/>
cracks of the rocks.</p>

<p>Great quantities of fish, and in almost endless variety, <br/>
inhabit the coves and harbors around the islands. The whale, <br/>
blackfish, shark, ground shark, pilot-fish, horse mackerel, <br/>
sturgeon, salmon, halibut, cod, pollock, tom cod, hake, had-<br/>
dock, mackerel, shad bass, alewife, herring, pohagen, <br/>
dolphin, whiting, frost-fish, flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, <br/>
skid, cusk, blueback, scallop, dogfish, muttonfish, lumpfish, <br/>
squid, five-fingers, monkfish, horsefish, sunfish, swordfish, <br/>
thrasher, cat, scuppog, tootog, eye fish, cunner, ling, also the <br/>
eel, lobster, clam, muscle, periwinkle, porpoise, seal, etc., are <br/>
found there.</p>

<p>Thus I have given a brief description of Vinal Haven. It <br/>
was quite dark when we landed there, without a farthing in <br/>
money. We made our way over the rocks and through the <br/>
cedars the best way we could, until we found a house, when <br/>
we rapped at the door, A woman put her head out of the <br/>
window and asked who was there and what was wanted.</p>

<p>I told her we were two strangers, and wanted a bed to lie <br/>
down upon until morning.</p>

<p>She let us in and gave us a bed, and we slept until quite <br/>
late, it being Sunday morning. When we came out and took <br/>
breakfast it was nearly noon. I asked her what she charged <br/>
for our entertainment, and she replied that we were welcome.</p>

<p>I then asked her if there was any religion or minister or <br/>
church on the island.</p>

<p>She informed me there was a [[Baptist|Baptist]] minister, by the name <br/>
of [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], who had a congregation and a meeting-house about <br/>
five miles from there.</p>

<p>We thanked her for her kindness, walked to the meeting-<br/>
house and stepped inside the doorway. We stood there until</p>",
671.0,44,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>a deacon came to the door, when I asked him to go and tell <br/>
the [[Gideon J. Newton|minister]] in the pulpit that there were two servants of <br/>
God at the door, who had a message to deliver to that people <br/>
and wished the privilege of delivering it.</p>

<p>He sent for us to come to the pulpit, so we walked through <br/>
the congregation with our valises under our arms, and took <br/>
a seat by the side of the minister, who was about to speak as <br/>
we came to the door.</p>

<p>He arose and delivered his discourse to the people, occupy-<br/>
ing about half an hour. When he closed he asked me what <br/>
was my wish.</p>

<p>I told him we wished to speak to the people at any hour <br/>
that would suit his or their convenience; so he gave notice <br/>
that there were two strangers present who would speak to the <br/>
people at five o'clock that evening.</p>

<p>We were quite a source of wonderment to the people, as they <br/>
had no idea who we were.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton asked us home to tea with him, and we gladly <br/>
accepted the invitation. When we arrived at his house I <br/>
opened my valise and took out the [[Bible|Bible]], [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] <br/>
and [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and Covenants]], laid them upon the table, and <br/>
took my seat.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton took up the books and looked at them, but <br/>
said nothing. I then asked him if there were any school-<br/>
houses upon the island, and if so, whether they were free to <br/>
preach in.</p>

<p>He answered that there were four, numbered respectively <br/>
from one to four, and that they were free.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton and family accompanied us to the meeting-<br/>
house, where we met a large congregation, none of whom <br/>
knew who we were or anything about our profession, except <br/>
the minister.</p>

<p>Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] and I went into the stand, and I arose with <br/>
peculiar feelings, and addressed the congregation for one hour,<br/>
taking for my text <i>##Galatians 1:8-9|Galatians i</i>. 89.##</p>

<p>This was the first time that I or any other Elder of the <br/>
[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] had (to my <br/>
knowledge) attempted to preach the fullness of the gospel and <br/>
the Book of Mormon to the inhabitants of any island of the sea.</p>",

<p><sup>t</sup>ember, and these were the first baptisms performed by proper <br/>
authority upon any of the islands of the sea (to my know-<br/>
ledge) in this dispensation.</p>

<p>Before we left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] some of the leading apostates there <br/>
had tried to discourage Brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] about going upon his <br/>
mission, telling him he would never baptize any one, and he <br/>
had better remain at home. When Captain [[Justus Ames|Eames]] offered <br/>
himself for baptism, I told Brother Hale to go and baptize <br/>
him, and prove those men [[false prophets|false prophets]], and he did so.</p>

<p>On the following Sabbath I baptized his brother, [[Ebenezer Ames|Ebenezer <br/>
Eames]], another sea captain, and a [[Melana Ames Dyer|young lady]].</p>

<p>Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], the Baptist minister, now commenced a war <br/>
against us, and sent to the [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Island]] for a Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]], a <br/>
[[Methodist|Methodist]] minister (with whom he had been at variance for <br/>
years) to come over and help him put down ""Mormonism.""</p>

<p>Mr. Douglass came over, and they got as many people together <br/>
as they could and held a conference. He railed against <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], the prophet, and the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], and, taking <br/>
that book in his hand, with out-stretched arm, declared that <br/>
he feared none of the judgments of God that would come upon <br/>
him for rejecting it as the word of God. (I never heard what <br/>
his sentiments upon this subject were at the end of his term of <br/>
fourteen years' imprisonment in the [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] Penitentiary, <br/>
for an outrage upon his daughter, the judgment of which <br/>
was given upon the testimony of his wife and daughter.)</p>

<p>I was present and heard Mr. Douglass' speech upon this <br/>
occasion and took minutes of the same. When he closed I <br/>
arose and informed the people that I would meet with them <br/>
next Sunday in the meeting-house, and answer Mr. Douglass, <br/>
and wished him as well as the people to be present.</p>

<p>I informed the people that Mr. Douglass had made many <br/>
false statements against Joseph Smith and the Latter-day <br/>
Saints, with whom he had no acquaintance, and he had mis-<br/>
quoted much scripture, all of which I could correct.</p>

<p>We continued to baptize the people on the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Island]] <br/>
until we had baptized every person who owned an interest in the <br/>
Baptist meeting-house. I then followed Mr. Douglass home <br/>
to the South Island and preached the gospel to and baptized <br/>
nearly all the members of his church.</p>",
671.0,47,,""">17th of September</time>, I met a large assembly from <br/>
both Islands, and took the same subject that Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]] <br/>
had dwelt upon in his remarks against the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] <br/>
and our principles.</p>

<p>I spoke two-and-a-half hours, and answered every objection <br/>
against the Book of Mormon, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] or our prin-<br/>
ciples.</p>

<p>I had good attention, and the people seemed satisfied. At <br/>
the close of the meeting Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] administered the ordin-<br/>
ance of baptism.</p>

<p>Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], in order to save his cause, went to the main-<br/>
land and brought over several ministers with him and held a <br/>
protracted meeting. They hoped by this to stop the work of <br/>
God, but all to no avail, for the whole people would attend <br/>
our meeting and receive the word of God, and we continued <br/>
to baptize.</p>

<p>We visited the dwellings of most of the inhabitants during <br/>
our sojourn there.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion, while standing upon Mr. [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Carver's]] farm <br/>
on the east end of the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Island]], we counted fifty-five <br/>
islands in that region, the majority of which were not inhabit-<br/>
ed. We also saw twenty ships under sail at the same time.</p>

<p>We had no lack for food while upon the island, for if we did <br/>
not wish to trouble our friends for a dinner, we only had to <br/>
borrow a spade or a hoe and a kettle and go to the beach and <br/>
dig a peck of clams. These, when boiled, would make a <br/>
delicious meal, which we often availed ourselves of.</p>

<p>One day, Elder Hale and I ascended to the top of a high <br/>
granite rock upon the [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Island]], for prayer and supplic-<br/>
ation. We sat down under the shade of a pine tree which <br/>
grew out of a fissure in the rock, and Elder Hale read the<br/>
##Jeremiah 16:16|16th chapter## of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], where mention is made of the <br/>
hunters and fishers that God would send in the last days to <br/>
gather Israel.</p>

<p>Of a truth here we were upon an Island of the sea, standing <br/>
upon a rock where we could survey the gallant ships and also <br/>
the islands, which were as full of rocks, ledges and caves as <br/>
any part of the earth. And what had brought us here? To</p>",

671.0,49,,""">5th of November</time>, I met with a large <br/>
assembly of Saints and friends, and again commenced baptiz-<br/>
ing such as would receive my testimony.</p>

<p>After visiting the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Island]] and holding meetings with <br/>
the Saints there, and baptizing two after meeting, I embarked <br/>
on board a sloop, with Captain [[Benjamin Coombs|Coombs]], for another island</p>",

when I crossed to the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Island]]. Here I found that the <br/>
seed I had sown was bringing forth fruit. Six persons were <br/>
ready for baptism.</p>

<p>But my mission upon these islands was not an exception to <br/>
the general rule: success did not come without many obstacles <br/>
presenting themselves. Those who rejected the word were <br/>
frequently inspired by the evil one to make an attempt at per-<br/>
secution.</p>

<p>Some of those who felt to oppose me went down to the har-<br/>
bor and got a swivel and small arms, and planted them close <br/>
by the school-house, near the sea shore, and while I was <br/>
speaking they commenced firing their cannon and guns. I <br/>
continued speaking in great plainness, but my voice was <br/>
mingled with the report of musketry.</p>

<p>I told the people my garments were clear of the blood of <br/>
the inhabitants of that island, and asked if any wished to <br/>
embrace the gospel. Two persons came forward and wished <br/>
to be baptized, and I baptized them.</p>

<p>On the following day when I went down to the seaside to <br/>
baptize a man, the rabble commenced firing guns again, as on <br/>
the previous night. I afterwards learned that notices were <br/>
posted up, warning me to leave the town, but I thought it <br/>
was better to obey God than man, and, therefore, did not go.</p>

<p>The next day I baptized three persons, and two days subse-<br/>
quently a couple of others.</p>",
671.0,52,,""">15th of February</time> I again crossed to the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North <br/>
Island]], and after remaining there seven days visiting, we <br/>
returned to [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]]. Here I met Brother James Townsend, <br/>
who had just arrived from [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]].</p>

<p>I ordained Brother Townsend to the office of an Elder, and <br/>
we concluded to take a journey to Bangor, and offer the <br/>
gospel to the inhabitants of that city.</p>

<p>We undertook the journey on foot in the dead of winter, <br/>
when the snow was very deep, and the first day broke the road <br/>
for seven miles to [[Searsmont, Waldo County, Maine|Scarsmont]]. The day following, it being <br/>
Sunday, we held two meetings, preached the gospel to the <br/>
people, and were kindly entertained.</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day we wallowed through snow-<br/>
drifts for a mile, to meet an appointment to preach in a school-</p>",
671.0,53,,""">21st of February</time>, as we came out of <br/>
the school-house, a light appeared in the north-eastern hori-<br/>
zon, and spread to the west and soon rolled over our heads. <br/>
It had the appearance of fire, blood and smoke, and at times <br/>
resembled contending armies. The heavens were illuminated <br/>
for the space of half an hour. It seemed at times as though <br/>
the veil was about to rend in twain and the elements were con-<br/>
tending with each other.</p>

<p>We looked upon it as one of the signs in the heavens pre-<br/>
dicted by the prophets of old, as to appear in the [[last days|last days]]. <br/>
We were wading through deep snowdrifts most of the time <br/>
while witnessing this remarkable scene.*</p>

<p>The following day we walked fifteen miles through deep <br/>
snow to [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], and, after being refused lodging for the night <br/>
by eight families, we were kindly entertained by a Mr. [[Thomas Tapley|Thomas <br/>
Teppley]].</p>

<p>There was an interesting incident connected with our stay at <br/>
his house. After eating our supper, it being late in the even-<br/>
ing, Mr. Teppley placed a stand before me with a [[Bible|Bible]] upon<br/>
it, asking me to read a chapter and have prayers with them, <br/>
he being a religious man.</p>

<p>I opened the Bible mechanically, when, the ##Matthew 25|25th chapter of <br/>
Matthew## being the first to catch my eye, I read it, and as I <br/>
closed the book Mr. Teppley turned to his [[Polly Wentworth Tapley|wife]] and said, ""Is<br/>
not this a strange thing?"" Then he explained to us that he <br/>
had just read that chapter and closed the book when we <br/>
rapped at the door, and he felt impressed to say, "" Walk in, <br/>
gentlemen.""</p>

<p>There is probably no other chapter in the whole book that <br/>
would have the same influence in causing any one to feed a <br/>
person who professed to be a [[servant of God|servant of God]], and asked for <br/>
bread.</p>

<p>After becoming acquainted with his circumstances I thought <br/>
it providential that we were led to his house, for although he <br/>
was a professor of religion and a [[Methodist|Methodist]], he was in a state</p>

671.0,54,,""">5th of March</time> we sailed from [[Penobscot, Penobscot County, Maine|Penobscot]] for the [[Isle of Holt, Knox County, Maine|Isle <br/>
of Holt]], where I held a meeting on the following evening.</p>

<p>The next day I took passage on the mail boat for the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North <br/>
Island]], where I again had the privilege of meeting with the <br/>
Saints for prayer and praise before the Lord.</p>

<p>On my arrival I received a package of letters from friends <br/>
abroad. One was from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and gave an account of the <br/>
[[apostasy|apostasy]] and tribulations which the Saints were passing <br/>
through. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Prophet and others, with their families, <br/>
had gone to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and the Saints were following them.</p>

<p>Brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] returned home, and I was again left <br/>
alone in the ministry.</p>",
671.0,55,,""">28th of March</time> I received a letter from Zion, <br/>
requesting me to counsel the Saints I had baptized to <br/>
sell their property and gather up to Zion.</p>

<p>About this time the Lord was manifesting Himself upon <br/>
the Islands in various ways, by dreams, visions, healings, signs <br/>
and wonders. I will relate one peculiar circumstance of this <br/>
kind that occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Ebenezer Carver]] had been investigating our doctrines <br/>
for quite a length of time, and, having a great desire to know <br/>
the truth of our religion, he walked to the sea shore, wishing <br/>
that he might have some manifestation in proof of its truth.</p>",
671.0,56,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>The passage of scripture came to his mind that there would <br/>
be no sign given ""but the sign of the prophet [[Jonah (OT)|Jonas]],"" and <br/>
while this thought was in his mind a large fish arose to the <br/>
top of the water, a distance from him in the sea, and suddenly <br/>
sank out of sight. He much desired to see it again, and soon <br/>
it arose to the top of the water, accompanied by another fish <br/>
of about the same size, and one of them swam on the water in <br/>
a straight line towards Mr. [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Carver]] as he stood upon the shore. <br/>
It came as near to him as the water would permit, and then <br/>
stopped and gazed at him with a penetrating eye, as though <br/>
it had a message for him. It then returned to its mate in <br/>
the ocean and swam out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Carver retraced his steps homeward, meditating upon <br/>
the scene and the wonderful condescension of the Lord.</p>

<p>It is proper to remark that this was at a season of the year <br/>
when fish of that size are never known upon those shores or <br/>
seas, and they are never, at any season, known to come ashore <br/>
as in the case mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Carver was convinced that it was intended by the Lord <br/>
as a sign to him.</p>

<p>Two days after this event I visited Mr. Carver at his house, <br/>
and found his [[Mary Stinson Carver|wife]] confined to her bed with a fever, and she <br/>
requested me to administer to her. I placed my [[laying on of hands|hands]] upon <br/>
her head, the power of God rested upon me, and I com-<br/>
manded her in the name of Jesus Christ to arise and walk.</p>

<p>She arose and was healed from that instant, and she walked <br/>
down to the sea and I baptized her in the same place where <br/>
the fish visited her husband. I confirmed her there, and she was <br/>
filled with the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] and returned to her home rejoicing.</p>

<p>I now called the people together and exhorted them to sell <br/>
their property and prepare to accompany me to the land of <br/>
Zion. I had labored hard for many days for the temporal <br/>
and spiritual welfare of the inhabitants of those islands, and <br/>
the Lord had blessed my labors and given me many souls as <br/>
seals of my ministry, for which I felt to praise Him; and now <br/>
I felt to labor quite as zealously to gather out those who had <br/>
embraced the gospel, and lead them to Zion.</p>

<p>The worst difficulty which the Saints had to contend with in <br/>
that day was from false brethren. [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]], who had</p>",

days afterwards I called the Saints of the North Island <br/>
together and communed with and instructed them. I also <br/>
informed them that the Spirit of God bore record to me that <br/>
it was our duty to leave the islands for a season and take a <br/>
western mission. They had been faithfully warned and the <br/>
Saints were established in the truth, while the wicked were <br/>
contending against us, and some were disposed to take our <br/>
lives if they had the power.</p>",

which then contained a population of one hundred thousand. <br/>
I ascended to the cupola of the court-house, from which I <br/>
had a fine view of the city. I visited several of the Saints in <br/>
the city, and walked over the long bridge to [[Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and <br/>
[[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]].</p>

ever met. The jailor permitted me to enter the room where <br/>
he was. It was the first time in my life I had ever entered a <br/>

both in.</p>

<p>By the help of God, I preached the gospel faithfully to my <br/>
father's household and to all that were with him, as well as to <br/>
my other relatives, and I had appointed a meeting on Sunday, <br/>
the 1st of July at my father's home.</p>

<p>My father was believing my testimony, as were all in his <br/>
household, but upon this occasion the [[Devil|devil]] was determined <br/>
to hinder the fulfillment of the promise of the patriarch <br/>
unto me.</p>

<p>It seemed as though Lucifer, the son of the morning, had <br/>
gathered together the hosts of hell and exerted his powers <br/>
upon us all. Distress overwhelmed the whole household, and <br/>
all were tempted to reject the work. And it seemed as <br/>
though the same power would devour me. I had to take to <br/>
my bed for an hour before the time of meeting. I there <br/>
prayed unto the Lord with my whole soul for deliverance, for <br/>

<p>It will be observed that this differs from nearly all other <br/>
revelations in this respect: a fixed day and a stated place were <br/>
given for the commencement of the mission. When the reve-<br/>
lation was given, all was peace and quietude in [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]],<br/>
Missouri, the city where most of the Latter-day Saints dwelt; <br/>
but before the time came for its fulfillment, the Saints of God <br/>
had been driven out of the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]] into the State <br/>
of [[Illinois|Illinois]], under the edict of Governor [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]; and the Mis-<br/>
sourians had sworn that if all the other revelations of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph <br/>
Smith]] were fulfilled, that should not be. It stated the day <br/>
and the place where the [[Twelve Apostles|Twelve Apostles]] should take leave <br/>
of the Saints, to go on their missions across the great waters, <br/>
and the mobocrats of Missouri had declared that they would <br/>
see that it should not be fulfilled.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the Lord, having a foreknowledge of <br/>
what would take place, had given the revelation in this man-<br/>
ner to see whether the Apostles would obey it at the risk of <br/>
their lives.</p>

<p>When the time drew near for the fulfillment of this com-<br/>
mandment of the Lord, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] was the President of <br/>
the Twelve Apostles; [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thos. B. Marsh]], who was the senior Apostle, had fallen. Brother Brigham called together those <br/>
of the Twelve who were then at [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], Illinois, to see what <br/>
their minds would be about going to Far West, to fulfill the <br/>
revelation. The Prophet Joseph and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], <br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] were in <br/>
prison in Missouri, at the time; but Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]], <br/>
the Patriarch, was at Quincy, Illinois. He and others who <br/>
were present did not think it wisdom for us to attempt the <br/>
journey, as our lives would be in great jeopardy. They <br/>
thought the Lord would take the will for the deed. But when <br/>
President Young asked the Twelve what our feelings were <br/>
upon the subject, we all of us, as the voice of one man, said <br/>
the Lord God had spoken, and it was for us to obey. It was <br/>
the Lord's business to take care of His servants, and we <br/>
would fulfill the commandment, or die trying</p>

the edict of the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|governor]], and though the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
and his brother, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], with other leading men were <br/>
in the hands of our enemies, in chains and in prison, we <br/>
moved on to the temple grounds in the city of [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and <br/>
held a council, and fulfilled the revelation and commandments <br/>
given unto us, and we performed many other things at this <br/>
council.</p>

<p>We excommunicated from the Church thirty-one persons, <br/>
who had apostatized and become its enemies.</p>

<p>The ""Mission of the Twelve"" was sung, and we then <br/>
repaired to the south-east corner of the temple ground, and, <br/>
with the assistance of Elder [[Alpheus Cutler|Alpheus Cutler]], the master work-<br/>
man of the building committee, laid the south-east chief <br/>
[[cornerstone|corner stone]] of the temple, according to revelation.</p>

<p>There were present of the Twelve Apostles: [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>

quorum of the Twelve, in the places of those who had fallen, <br/>
as they had been called by revelation.</p>

<p>[[Darwin Chase|Darwin Chase]] and [[Norman Shearer|Norman Shearer]], who had just been <br/>
liberated from [[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]] prison, were also ordained to the <br/>
office of Seventies. The Twelve then offered up vocal prayer <br/>
in the following order: Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, <br/>
Orson Pratt, John E. Page, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff <br/>
and George A. Smith, after which we sang ""Adam-ondi-<br/>

<p>The Twelve then took their leave of, and gave the parting <br/>
hand to, the following Saints, agreeable to revelation: [[A. Butler|A.<br/>

till we crossed the public square, and entered [[Elijah Fordham|Brother Ford-<br/>
ham's]] house. Brother Fordham had been dying for an hour, <br/>
and we expected each minute would be his last.</p>

<p>I felt the power of God that was overwhelming His Prophet.</p>

<p>When we entered the house, Brother Joseph walked up to <br/>
Brother Fordham, and took him by the right hand; in his <br/>
left hand he held his hat.</p>

<p>He saw that Brother Fordham’s eyes were glazed, and that <br/>
he was speechless and unconscious.</p>

<p>After taking hold of his hand, he looked down into the <br/>
dying man's face and said: ""Brother Fordham, do you not <br/>
know me?"" At first he made no reply; but we could all see <br/>
the effect of the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] resting upon him.</p>

<p>He again said: ""Elijah, do you not know me?""</p>

<p>With a low whisper, Brother Fordham answered, ""Yes!""</p>

<p>The Prophet then said, ""Have you not faith to be healed?""</p>

<p>The answer, which was a little plainer than before, was: ""I <br/>
am afraid it is too late. If you had come sooner, I think it <br/>
might have been.”</p>

<p>He had the appearance of a man waking from sleep. It <br/>
was the sleep of death.</p>

<p>Joseph then said: ""Do you believe that Jesus is the Christ?""</p>

<p>""I do, Brother Joseph,"" was the response.</p>

<p>Then the Prophet of God spoke with a loud voice, as in <br/>
the majesty of the Godhead: ""Elijah, I command you, in the <br/>
name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise and be made whole!""</p>

<p>The words of the Prophet were not like the words of a man, <br/>
but like the [[voice of God|voice of God]]. It seemed to me that the house <br/>
shook from its foundation.</p>

<p>Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed like a man raised from <br/>
the dead. A healthy color came to his face, and life was mani-<br/>
fested in every act.</p>

<p>His feet were done up in Indian meal [[poultices|poultices]]. He kicked <br/>
them off his feet, scattered the contents, and then called <br/>
for his clothes and put them on. He asked for a bowl of bread</p>",

<p>and milk, and ate it; then put on his hat and followed us <br/>
into the street, to visit others who were sick.</p>

<p>The unbeliever may ask: “Was there not deception in this?”</p>

<p>If there is any deception in the mind of the unbeliever, <br/>
there was certainly none with [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]], the dying man, <br/>
nor with those who were present with him, for in a few min-<br/>
utes more he would have been in the [[spirit world|spirit world]], had he not <br/>
been rescued. Through the blessing of God, he lived up till <br/>

spirit world.</p>

<p>Among the number were [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney <br/>
Rigdon]], [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[George Albert Smith|George A. <br/>

is the only one living who was present at the time, and he <br/>
will soon mingle with those who have gone.</p>

<p>As soon as we left Brother Fordham's house, we went into <br/>
the house of [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Noble]], who was very low and <br/>
dangerously sick.</p>

<p>When we entered the house, Brother Joseph took him by <br/>
the hand, and commanded him, in the name of Jesus Christ, <br/>
to arise and be made whole. He did arise and was immedi-<br/>

<p>While this was going on, the wicked mob in the place, led <br/>
by one [[David Wells Kilbourne|Kilburn]], had become alarmed, and followed us into <br/>
Brother Noble's house.</p>

<p>Before they arrived there, Brother Joseph had called upon <br/>
Brother Fordham to offer prayer.</p>

<p>While he was praying, the mob entered, with all the evil <br/>
spirits accompanying them.</p>

the room cleared of both that class of men and their attend-<br/>

finished his prayer.</p>

sick nigh unto death.</p>

<p>They were some two miles from [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]].</p>

time, he said he would send someone to heal them; and he <br/>
turned to me and said: ""You go with the man and heal his <br/>
children.”</p>

<p>He took a red silk handkerchief out of his pocket and gave <br/>
it to me, and told me to wipe their faces with the handker-<br/>

<p>Soon a brother came along with a wagon, and took us in. <br/>
As we were driving through the place, we came to [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. <br/>
Pratt]], who was stripped to the shirt and pants with his head <br/>
and feet bare. He was hewing a log, preparing to build a <br/>
cabin.</p>

<p>""He said: ""Brother Woodruff, I have no money, but I <br/>
have an empty purse, which I will give you."" He brought <br/>
it to me, and I thanked him for it.</p>

<p>We went a few rods further, and met Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. <br/>
Kimball]], in the same condition, also hewing a log, towards <br/>
building a cabin.</p>

<p>He said: ""As Parley has given you a purse, I have got a <br/>
dollar I will give you to put in it.”</p>

<p>He gave me both a dollar and a blessing.</p>

<p>We drove sixteen miles across a prairie, and spent the night <br/>
with a Brother [[Brother Merrill|Merrill]]. The day following we rode ten miles, <br/>
to a Brother [[Ute Perkins|Perkins']], and he took us in his wagon to <br/>
[[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]], and from thence to Brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith's]].</p>

<p>I rode four hours during the day over a very rough road of <br/>
stones and stumps, lying on my back in the bottom of the <br/>
wagon, shaking with the ague, and I suffered much.</p>

<p>We held a meeting in a grove near Don Carlos Smith's, and <br/>
here Elder Taylor baptized [[George Miller|George Miller]], who afterwards <br/>
was ordained a Bishop.</p>

<p>At the meeting the Saints gave us nine dollars, and George <br/>
Miller gave us a horse to help us on our journey.</p>

<p>I rode to [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] with Father [[John Coltrin|Coltrin]], where I had an <br/>
interview with several families of the Fox Island Saints, <br/>
whom I had brought up with me from [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]], in 1838.<br/>
I spent several days with them and at [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], where <br/>
Elder Taylor published fifteen hundred copies, in pamphlet <br/>
form, of a brief sketch of the persecutions and sufferings of <br/>
the Latter-day Saints, inflicted by the inhabitants of [[Missouri|Mis-<br/>

<p>We sold our horse, and in company with Father Coltrin, <br/>
Brother Taylor and myself left Springfield, and continued <br/>
our journey.</p>",

Taylor concluded to remain there for the day, and hold a <br/>

I spoke upon the first principles of the gospel. He followed <br/>
me, and spoke until he was exhausted.</p>

taken with a chill and fever, and had a very bad night. <br/>

preached the gospel to him, and he was believing. I had also <br/>
been associated with him from my youth up.</p>

<p>On his death-bed he sent me a request that I would preach <br/>
his funeral sermon.</p>

<p>I was having the chills and fever daily at the time, attended <br/>
with a very severe cough, so much so, that my father thought <br/>
that I would never leave his home alive. But when they <br/>
brought me the request of my dying uncle, and the day came <br/>
for his burial, I told my father to get his horse and buggy <br/>
ready, for I was going to attend the funeral.</p>

<p>He thought I was very reckless in regard to my own life, as <br/>
I had suffered with the chills and fever some fifteen days, and <br/>
to attempt to speak in my weak state, and to begin at the same <br/>
hour that my chill was to come on, seemed to him foolhardy.</p>

<p>My parents were quite alarmed, yet according to my request <br/>

arguments of the minister ran rather more into abuse than <br/>

<p>Elder Taylor told the Methodist minister that he did not <br/>
think it was becoming in a daughter to find so much fault with <br/>
the mother as they did, for as the Methodists came out of the <br/>
Catholics, Elder Taylor thought the mother had as much <br/>

<p>We very soon had a pleasant interview with Elder Willard <br/>

<p>We spent three days at Preston in visiting the Saints, and <br/>
on the 17th we held a council at Elder Richards' home in <br/>
that place.</p>

was finally resolved that Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and [[Joseph Fielding|Joseph <br/>

by the Apostles present, the council adjourned.</p>",

<p>Elder [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] had been called to be one of the <br/>
[[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles|quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], but had not yet received his <br/>
ordination.</p>

<p>On the day following I parted with Elders [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] and [[Joseph Fielding|Field-<br/>

who tarried in [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]]. Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] and I went to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Man-<br/>

<p>It was the first time I ever visited that city. I here<br/>
first met with Elder [[William Clayton|Wm. Clayton]]. As soon as I had an <br/>
introduction to him, he informed me that one of the sisters <br/>
in that place was possessed of the [[Devil|devil]], and he asked me to <br/>
go and cast it out of her, thinking that one of the Twelve <br/>
Apostles could do anything in this line he might wish to.</p>

<p>However, I went with him to the house where the woman <br/>
lay, in the hands of three men, in a terrible rage, and trying <br/>
to tear her clothing from her.</p>

<p>I also found quite a number of Saints present, and some <br/>
unbelievers, who had come to see the devil cast out and a <br/>
miracle wrought.</p>

<p>If I had acted upon my own judgment I should not have <br/>
attempted to administer to her with the company present, but <br/>
as I was a stranger there, and Brother Clayton presided over <br/>
the branch, I joined him in administering to the woman. But <br/>
the unbelief of the wicked present was so great, we could not <br/>
cast the devil out of her, and she raged worse than ever.</p>

<p>I then ordered the room to be cleared, and when the com-<br/>
pany left the house, except the few attending to her, we [[laying on of hands|laid <br/>
hands]] upon her, and I commanded the devil to come out of <br/>
her, in the name of Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and she <br/>
was entirely cured and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next day being the Sabbath, she came before a large <br/>
congregation of people, and bore testimony to what the Lord <br/>
has done for her. We had a large assemblage through the <br/>
day and evening, to whom I preached the gospel.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the devil, not being satisfied with <br/>
being cast out of the woman, entered into her little child, <br/>
which was but a few months old.</p>

<p>I was called upon to visit the child. I found it in great <br/>
distress, writhing in its mother's arms. We laid hands upon</p>",

ley, and administered the sacrament unto the Saints.</p>

<p>In the evening I again met with a large assembly of the <br/>
Saints and strangers, and while singing the first hymn the <br/>
Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and the voice of God said <br/>
to me, ""This is the last meeting that you will hold with this <br/>
people for many days.”</p>

<p>I was astonished at this, as I had many appointments out in <br/>
that district.</p>

<p>When I arose to speak to the people, I told them that it <br/>
was the last meeting I should hold with them for many days. <br/>
They were as much astonished as I was.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting four persons came forward for <br/>

Him what His will was concerning me.</p>",

through [[Dudley, Staffordshire, England|Dudley]], [[Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England|Stourbridge]], [[Stourport, Worcestershire, England|Stourport]] and [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]], and <br/>
then walked a number of miles to Mr. John Benbow's, [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill <br/>

<p>I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthy farmer, cultivating <br/>
three hundred acres of land, occupying a good mansion, and <br/>
having plenty of means. His wife, [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Jane]], had no children.</p>

<p>I presented myself to him as a missionary from America, <br/>
an Elder of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], <br/>
who had been sent to him by the commandment of God as a <br/>
messenger of salvation, to preach the gospel of life unto him <br/>

preaching, and he sent word through the neighborhood that <br/>
an American missionary would preach at his house that <br/>
evening.</p>

<p>As the time drew nigh many of the neighbors came in, and <br/>
I preached my first gospel sermon in the house. I also <br/>
preached on the following evening at the same place, and <br/>
baptized six persons, including Mr. John Benbow and his <br/>
wife, and four preachers of the United Brethren.</p>",

<p>The [[St. Michael and All Angels Parish Church, Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|parish church]] that stood in the neighborhood of <br/>
Brother Benbow's, presided over by the [[Henry Fisher|rector]] of the <br/>
parish, was attended during the day by only fifteen persons, <br/>

a constable, and had been sent by the rector of the parish <br/>
with a warrant to arrest me.</p>

<p>I asked him ""For what crime?""</p>

<p>He said, ""For preaching to the people.""</p>

<p>I told him that I, as well as the rector, had a license for <br/>
preaching the gospel to the people, and that if he would take <br/>
a chair I would wait upon him after meeting.</p>

<p>He took my chair and sat beside me. I preached the first <br/>
principles of the everlasting gospel for an hour and a quarter. <br/>
The power of God rested upon me, the Spirit filled the house, <br/>
and the people were convinced.</p>

preachers and the constable.</p>

be baptized.""</p>

<p>I told him I would like to baptize him. I went down to the <br/>
pool and baptized the seven. We then met together and I <br/>
confirmed thirteen, and [[sacrament|broke bread]] unto the Saints and we all <br/>
rejoiced together.</p>

<p>The constable went to the rector and told him if he wanted <br/>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p>CLOSING TESTIMONY—GOOD AND EVIL SPIRITS.</p>

<p>BEFORE closing this little book, as a reader for our chil-<br/>
dren, I wish to bear my testimony upon several principles, <br/>
to the Latter-day Saints, especially to the [[rising generation|rising generation]], <br/>
the young men of Israel.</p>

<p>First, I wish to speak of the spirits of good and evil. The <br/>
Lord says, whatever leads to good is of God, and whatever <br/>
leads to do evil is of the [[Devil|devil]]. This is a very important sub-<br/>
ject for us to understand.</p>

<p>The scriptures again tell us that there are many spirits gone <br/>
out into the world; and that we should try the spirits, to prove <br/>
which are of God and which are of the evil one. The [[New Testament|New <br/>
Testament]] says that every spirit that confesses that Jesus is the <br/>
Christ, is born of God; and every spirit that denieth that <br/>
Jesus is the Christ is anti-Christ, and is not of God. I will <br/>
also add that every spirit that confesses that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] <br/>
was a Prophet of God, and that the <i>[[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]]</i>, <i>[[Bible|Bible]]</i> <br/>
and <i>[[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and Covenants]]</i> are true, is of God; and every <br/>
spirit that denieth this is not of God, but is of the evil one.</p>

<p>1 wish here to ask our young friends as well as the older <br/>
ones, the question: Do you ever consider or contemplate any-<br/>
thing about the number of [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] that occupy the earth, <br/>
who are at war against God and against all good, and who <br/>
seek to destroy all the children of men in every age of the<br/>
world?</p>

<p>Let us reason together a moment upon this subject. It may <br/>
be impossible for any man, without direct revelation from God, <br/>
to get to know the exact number, but we may approximate <br/>
towards it.</p>

<p>The Lord has said by revelation that [[Lucifer|Lucifer]], an angel in <br/>
authority, rebelled against God, and drew away one-third part <br/>
of the hosts of heaven; and he was cast down to the earth <br/>
and the heavens wept over him.</p>",
671.0,96,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>How many were cast out of heaven down to the earth? We <br/>
suppose that the inhabitants of heaven here referred to<br/>
were the spirits begotten of our Father in heaven who were to <br/>
come down to the earth and take tabernacles. How many <br/>
were there to come down and take tabernacles? This, again, <br/>
may be difficult to tell, yet perhaps we may come near enough <br/>
for the purpose. It has generally been conceded that there <br/>
are about 1,000,000,000 persons on the earth at a time, though <br/>
the late statistics make out 1,400,000,000 at the present time. <br/>
But we will say 1,000,000,000. It is also said that a genera-<br/>
tion passes off the earth every thirty-three and one-third <br/>
years, making three generations in a century, which would be <br/>
3,000,000,000 in one hundred years. Multiply this by ten <br/>
and it will make 30,000,000,000 in 1,000 years. Multiply <br/>
again by seven and it will make 210,000,000,000 in 7,000 <br/>
years.</p>

<p>The argument might be used that when our earth was first <br/>
peopled there were but two persons on the earth, and after the <br/>
flood but eight souls were left alive, but the probability is that <br/>
during the [[millennium|millennium]] the inhabitants will increase very fast <br/>
as the age of children will be as the age of a tree, and the <br/>
inhabitants of the earth will not die off as they do now.</p>

<p>But we will suppose that there were 100,000,000,000 of <br/>
fallen spirits sent down from heaven to earth, and that there <br/>
are, 1,000,000,000 of inhabitants upon the face of the earth <br/>
to-day, that would make one hundred evil spirits to every <br/>
man, woman and child living on the earth; and the whole <br/>
mission and labor of these spirits is to lead all the children of <br/>
men to do evil and to effect their destruction.</p>

<p>Now, I want all our boys and girls to reflect upon this, and <br/>
to see what danger they are in, and the warfare they have to <br/>
pass through.</p>

<p>These one hundred [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] to each one of the children <br/>
of men seek to lead them into every temptation possible, <br/>
to use tobacco, smoke, drink whisky, get drunk, curse, swear, <br/>
lie, steal, and commit adultery and murder, and do every evil <br/>
to cut them off from exaltation as far as possible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] labors and strives to <br/>
preserve all the children of men from these evils; and the</p>",
671.0,97,,"<p>ADVICE TO THE YOUNG.</p>

<p>Lord has given His angels charge concerning us, and they do <br/>
all they can for our salvation.</p>

<p>But yet we all have our agency, to choose the good and <br/>
refuse the evil, or choose the evil and refuse the good. The <br/>
Lord forces no man to heaven; neither does the Lord tempt <br/>
any man to do evil. When a man is tempted to do evil, it <br/>
is by the power of the [[devil|devil]], who is an enemy to all righteous-<br/>
ness.</p>

<p>I feel very anxious to have our boys and girls, our young <br/>
men and maidens, seek for that which is good.</p>

<p>Whenever you are tempted to do evil, turn from it. Never <br/>
make light of any of the commandments or ordinances of the <br/>
gospel of Christ, and when you meet with any persons who do <br/>
it, shun their society.</p>

<p>Avoid the use of tobacco and [[strong drink|strong drink]], for they lead to evil.</p>

<p>You are laying the foundation while in the days of your <br/>
youth, for character which will decide your destiny through <br/>
all time and throughout all eternity, either for good or evil.</p>

<p>The Lord has told us by revelation (See <i>[[Doctrine and Covenants|Doc. and Cov.]]</i> Sec.<br/>
130) that whatever knowledge or principle of intelligence we <br/>
attain to in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection, <br/>
and any person who gains more knowledge and intelligence in <br/>
this life through his diligence and obedience than another, <br/>
will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</p>

<p>Therefore, we should all strive to be diligent in obtaining <br/>
intelligence, and bringing to pass righteousness upon our <br/>
agency, and not wait to be commanded in all things, and great <br/>
will be our reward in so doing.</p>",

SAINTS SAVED FROM A STEAMBOAT DISASTER BY THE <br/>
SPIRIT'S WARNING—PLOT TO WAYLAY ELDER [[Charles Coulson Rich|C. C. RICH]]<br/>
AND PARTY FOILED BY THE SAME POWER.</p>

<p>IN order to obtain revelation from God, and in order to know, <br/>
when we do obtain a revelation, whether it is from God or <br/>
not, we must follow the teachings of the revelations of God <br/>
unto us St. [[Epistle of James|James]] says: ""If any man lack wisdom, let him <br/>
ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth <br/>
not; and it shall be given him."" [##James 1:5##] Again, it is said,  ""Ask, and <br/>
it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it <br/>
shall be opened unto you."" [##Matthew 7:7##]</p>

<p>It was upon this promise that Joseph Smith went before <br/>
the Lord and prayed in the name of Jesus Christ, and asked <br/>
for knowledge, wisdom and understanding, in order to know <br/>
what to do to be saved; and he proved the promise of St. <br/>
[[James (NT)|James]] before the Lord, and the heavens were opened to his <br/>
view, and the Father and Son were revealed unto him, and <br/>
the voice of the great [[Elohim|Eloheim]] unto him was: ”This is my <br/>
beloved Son, hear ye Him.""</p>

<p>This was the first revelation of God to him. He did <br/>
hearken to the voice of Jesus Christ all his life afterwards, <br/>
and received a code of revelations and the word of the Lord <br/>
unto him as long as he dwelt in the flesh.</p>

<p>Joseph Smith left as strong a testimony as was ever given <br/>
to the human family, and sealed that testament with his own <br/>
life and blood.</p>

<p>We all have to pursue the same course in order to obtain <br/>
revelations from God. But I wish to impress this truth upon <br/>
the [[rising generation|rising generation]] and all who read this testimony, that the <br/>
Lord does not give revelations or send angels to men or work</p>",
671.0,99,,"<p>INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PROPHET [[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH SMITH]].</p>

<p>miracles to accommodate the notions of any man who is seek-<br/>
ing for a sign.</p>

<p>When we have the principles of the gospel revealed to us <br/>
through the mouth of the Savior, or by inspired prophets or <br/>
apostles, we have no need to ask the Lord to reveal that unto <br/>
us again.</p>

<p>While the priesthood is restored to the earth, and <br/>
the revelations of God are revealed to us through the mouths <br/>
of prophets and apostles concerning the [[fulness of the gospel|fullness of the gospel]] <br/>
—doctrine, ordinances and principles, we should study them, <br/>
and treasure up knowledge by faith. We should study out of <br/>
the best books, and the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] will bring to our remem-<br/>
brance those things which we stand in need of, in the self-same <br/>
hour that we are called to teach the people.</p>

<p>But when any priest, elder, prophet, apostle, or messenger <br/>
is sent of God to preach the gospel, gather the Saints, work <br/>
in temples or perform any work for the Lord, and that man <br/>
is faithful and humble before the Lord, in his prayers and <br/>
duty, and there is any snare or evil in his path, or the <br/>
righteous to be sought out, or danger to the emigration of the <br/>
Saints either by sea or land, or knowledge needed in a temple, <br/>
then the Lord will reveal to him all that is necessary to meet <br/>
the emergency.</p>

<p>The teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith to President <br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and the rest of us was to obtain the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Spirit]], <br/>
get acquainted with it and its operations, and listen to the <br/>
whisperings of that Spirit and obey its voice, and it soon <br/>
will become a principle of revelation unto us.</p>

<p>We have found this true in our experience, and in order to <br/>
prove whether a revelation is from God or not we follow out <br/>
the principles revealed to us, and if we find that which was <br/>
manifested to us prove true, we know it is from God; for <br/>
truth is one of His attributes, and the Holy Ghost deceiveth <br/>
no man. When a man becomes acquainted with the whisper-<br/>
ings of the Holy Ghost, which is revelation, he should be <br/>
very careful to obey it, for his life may depend upon it.</p>

<p>Revelation is one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and for <br/>
the benefit of my young friends who may read this work, I <br/>
will give an account of a few instances from my own experience <br/>
of listening to the revelations of the Holy Ghost to me.</p>",

<p>In 1848, after my return to [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] from our <br/>
pioneer journey, I was appointed by the Presidency of the <br/>
Church to take my family and go to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]], to gather up the <br/>
remnant of the Latter-day Saints and lead them to the valleys <br/>
of the mountains.</p>

<p>While on my way east I put my carriage into the yard of <br/>
one of the brethren in [[Indiana|Indiana]], and Brother [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] set <br/>
his wagon by the side of mine, and not more than two feet <br/>
from it.</p>

<p>[[Dominicus Carter|Dominicus Carter]], of [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]], and my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and four children <br/>
were with me. My wife, one child and I went to bed in the <br/>
carriage, the rest sleeping in the house.</p>

<p>I had been in bed but a short time when a voice said to me: <br/>
“Get up, and move your carriage.""</p>

<p>It was not thunder, lightning or an earthquake, but the <br/>
[[still small voice|still, small voice]] of the Spirit of God the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]].</p>

<p>I told my wife I must get up and move my carriage. She <br/>
asked: ""What for?""</p>

<p>I told her I did not know, only the Spirit told me to do it.</p>

<p>I got up and moved my carriage several rods, and set it by <br/>
the side of the house.</p>

<p>As I was returning to bed the same Spirit said to me, ''Go <br/>
and move your mules away from that oak tree,” which was <br/>
about one hundred yards north of our carriage.</p>

<p>I moved them to a young hickory grove and tied them up. <br/>
I then went to bed.</p>

<p>In thirty minutes a whirlwind caught the tree to which my <br/>
mules had been fastened, broke it off near the ground, and <br/>
carried it one hundred yards, sweeping away two fences in its <br/>
course, and laid it prostrate through that yard where my <br/>
carriage stood, and the top limbs hit my carriage as it was.</p>

<p>In the morning I measured the trunk of the tree which fell <br/>
where my carriage had stood, and I found it to be five feet in <br/>
circumference. It came within a foot of Brother Hyde's <br/>
wagon, but did not touch it.</p>

<p>Thus, by obeying the revelation of the Spirit of God to me <br/>
I saved my life and the lives of my wife and child, as well as <br/>
my animals.</p>

<p>In the morning I went on my way rejoicing.</p>",
671.0,101,,"<p>SAVED FROM A STEAM-BOAT DISASTER.</p>

<p>While returning to [[Utah Territory|Utah]] in 1850 with a large company of <br/>
Saints from [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] and the east, on my arrival at [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] I <br/>
engaged a passage for myself and company on a steamer to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St. <br/>
Louis]]. But no sooner had I engaged the passage than the <br/>
Spirit said to me, ""Go not on board of that steamer, neither <br/>
you nor your company.''</p>

<p>I obeyed the revelation to me, and I did not go on board, <br/>
but took another steamer.</p>

<p>The first steamer started at dark, with two hundred passen-<br/>
gers on board. When five miles down the [[Ohio River, United States|Ohio river]] it took <br/>
fire, burned the tiller ropes so that the vessel could not reach <br/>
shore, and the lives of nearly all on board were lost either by <br/>
fire or water. We arrived in safety at our destination, by <br/>
obeying the revelation of the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] to us.</p>

<p>In another instance, after attending a large annual conference <br/>
in [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]], and, having a good deal of business to <br/>
attend to, I was somewhat weary, and at the close of the con-<br/>
ference I thought I would repair to my home and have a rest.</p>

<p>As I went into the yard the Spirit said to me, ""Take your <br/>
team and go to the farm,"" which is some three miles south of <br/>
the [[Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|tabernacle]].</p>

<p>As I was hitching the horses to the wagon Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]]<br/>
asked where I was going.</p>

<p>I said, ""To the farm.""</p>

<p>""What for?"" she asked.</p>

<p>""I do not know,"" I replied; but when I arrived there I <br/>
found out.</p>

<p>The creek had overflowed, broken through my ditch, sur-<br/>
rounded my home and filled my barn-yard and pig pen. My <br/>
[[Emma Smith Woodruff|wife]] was wading in the water, trying to turn it from the lot to <br/>
save the home and family.</p>

<p>Through my own exertions I soon turned it, and prevented <br/>
much damage that might have occurred had I not obeyed the <br/>
voice of the Spirit.</p>

<p>This same Spirit of revelation has been manifested to many <br/>
of my brethren in their labors in the kingdom of God, one of <br/>
which I will here name.</p>

<p>Elder [[Charles Coulson Rich|Chas. C. Rich]] was going from [[Sacramento, Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]] to [[San Bernardino, San Bernardino County, California|San <br/>
Bernardino]] with a company of the brethren. He had in his</p>",
671.0,102,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>possession a large amount of money to make payment on their <br/>
land purchase. This was known to some road agents in the <br/>
vicinity, who gathered a company of robbers and went on <br/>
ahead of Brother [[Charles Coulson Rich|Rich]] and lay in ambush, intending to kill <br/>
the ""Mormons"" and rob them of their money.</p>

<p>Before reaching the company of robbers Brother Rich came <br/>
to a by-path or trail. The Spirit then told him to take that <br/>
path.</p>

<p>The brethren with him marveled at his course, not knowing <br/>
that enemies awaited them, but they arrived in safety at San <br/>
Bernardino with their lives and money, while the robbers <br/>
wondered why their prey did not come.</p>

<p>RESULT OF NOT OBEYING THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT—LOST <br/>
IN A SNOWSTORM—SAVED IN ANSWER TO PRAYER—<br/>
REVELATION TO MISSIONARIES NECESSARY—REVELA-<br/>
TIONS IN THE [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|ST. GEORGE TEMPLE]].</p>

<p>I WILL now give an example from my own experience of <br/>
the result of not obeying the voice of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Some years since I had a part of my family living in [[Randolph, Rich County, Utah Territory|Ran-<br/>
dolph]], Rich County. I was there on a visit, with my team, <br/>
in the month of December.</p>

<p>One Monday morning my monitor, the Spirit watching <br/>
over me, said, ""Take your team and go home to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake <br/>
City]].""</p>

<p>When I named it to my family who were at Randolph they <br/>
urged me strongly to stop longer.</p>

<p>Through their persuasion I stayed until Saturday morning, <br/>
with the Spirit continually prompting me to go home. I then <br/>
began to feel ashamed to think that I had not obeyed the <br/>
whisperings of the Spirit to me before.</p>",
671.0,103,,"<p>LOST IN A SNOW STORM.</p>

<p>I took my team and started early on Saturday morning. <br/>
When I arrived at [[Woodruff, Rich County, Utah Territory|Woodruff]], the Bishop urged me to stop <br/>
until Monday and he would go with me.</p>

<p>I told him, ""No, I had tarried too long already.""</p>

<p>I drove on sprightly, and when within fifteen miles of<br/>
[[Wasatch County, Utah Territory|Wasatch]], a furious snow storm overtook me, the wind blowing <br/>
heavily in my face.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes I could not see any road whatever, and <br/>
knew not how or where to guide my horses.</p>

<p>I left my lines loosely on my animals, went inside my wagon, <br/>
tied down the cover, and committed my life and guidance into <br/>
the hands of the Lord, trusting to my horses to find the way, <br/>
as they had twice before passed over that road.</p>

<p>I prayed to the Lord to forgive my sin in not obeying the <br/>
voice of the Spirit to me, and implored Him to preserve my <br/>
life.</p>

<p>My horses brought me into the Wasatch station at 9 o'clock <br/>
in the evening, with the hubs of my wagon dragging in the <br/>
snow.</p>

<p>I got my horses under cover, and had to remain there until <br/>
the next Monday night, with the snow six feet deep on the <br/>
level, and still snowing.</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty at last that I saved the lives of <br/>
my horses by getting them into a box car and taking them to <br/>
[[Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Ogden]]; while if I had obeyed the revelation of <br/>
the Spirit of God to me, I should have traveled to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] over a <br/>
good road without any storm.</p>

<p>As I have received the good and the evil, the fruits of <br/>
obedience and disobedience, I think I am justified in exhorting <br/>
all my young friends to always obey the whisperings of the <br/>
Spirit of God, and they will always be safe.</p>

<p>The [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] will rule over and guide all men who will <br/>
permit it and seek for it, and this is especially necessary for <br/>
young Elders who are laboring in the vineyard of the Lord. <br/>
For the Lord knows where the righteous, honest and meek of <br/>
the earth are, and will lead the Elders to them</p>

<p>I have already related a remarkable instance of this in my <br/>
own experience, when the voice of the Lord came to me in <br/>
the town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], England, in 1840.</p>",
671.0,104,,""">March 1, 1877</time>, the day that I was seventy <br/>
years old, one hundred and fifty-four sisters at St. George went <br/>
into the temple to get endowments for the same number of <br/>
the female portion of my dead.</p>

<p>This principle was received by President Young and adopted <br/>
from that hour, and through the kindness of friends I have had <br/>
nearly two thousand of my friends receive endowments in the</p>",
671.0,105,,"<p>PATRIARCHAL BLESSINGS.</p>

<p>temple of the Lord; and thousands of others have received <br/>
the same blessings in the same way.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] received revelations in that [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|temple]], and <br/>
there are yet many revelations to be received in the last days, <br/>
concerning the [[redemption of the dead|redemption of the dead]] and many other sub-<br/>
jects, but they will all be manifest in due time through the <br/>
proper authority unto the Church and Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>There are many other manifestations of the power of God <br/>
and the revelations of Jesus Christ to us in our lives. We <br/>
have been called by revelation to give [[endowments|endowments]] for many <br/>
persons now dead, who, when living, were honorable men of <br/>
the earth, and some who were prominent in our nation, but <br/>
who were not members of our family.</p>

<p>But I have said sufficient upon this branch of the sub-<br/>
ject.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVIII.</p>

<p>PATRIARCHAL BLESSINGS AND THEIR FULFILLMENT—PRE-<br/>
DICTIONS IN MY OWN BLESSING—GOLD-DUST FROM <br/>
[[California|CALIFORNIA]]—TAUGHT BY AN ANGEL—STRUGGLE WITH <br/>
EVIL SPIRITS—ADMINISTERED TO BY ANGELS—WHAT <br/>
ANGELS ARE SENT TO THE EARTH FOR.</p>

<p>THE duty of a Patriarch is to bestow blessings upon his <br/>
posterity and the children of men.</p>

<p>In a revelation (<i>[[Doctrine and Covenants|Doc, and Cov.]]</i>, Sec. 107), the Lord says that <br/>
""Three years previous to the death of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]], he called [[Seth (OT)|Seth]], <br/>
[[Enos (OT)|Enos]], [[Cainan (OT)|Cainan]], [[Mahalaleel (OT)|Mahalaleel]], [[Jared (OT)|Jared]], [[Enoch (OT)|Enoch]], and [[Methuselah (OT)|Methuselah]], who <br/>
were all High Priests, with the residue of his posterity who <br/>
were righteous, into the valley of [[Adam-ondi-Ahman, Daviess County, Missouri|Adam-ondi-Ahman]], and <br/>
there bestowed upon them his last blessings. * * And <br/>
Adam * * predicted whatsoever should befall his pos-<br/>
terity unto the last generation. These things are all written</p>",
671.0,106,,""">15th day of April, 1837</time>.</p>

<p>Many marvelous things which he sealed upon my head, for <br/>
which I could then see no earthly chance of fulfillment, have <br/>
already been fulfilled to the very letter.</p>

<p>One or two instances I will name. He said I should have <br/>
access to the treasures hid in the ground to assist me in get-<br/>
ting myself and others to Zion.</p>

<p>When in [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] gathering up the Saints, in 1850 <br/>
[[Alexander Badlam|Alexander Badlam]] went to [[California|California]] on business, and the <br/>
Saints who were digging gold filled a little sack with gold <br/>
dust and sent it to me to assist me on my mission.</p>

<p>By the sale of this treasure from California I was enabled to <br/>
emigrate myself, family and a number of others to Zion in <br/>
the mountains.</p>

<p>He also said I should have power to bring my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and his <br/>
family into the Church. This was fulfilled when I visited them <br/>
during my mission to the [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]], as previously related.</p>

<p>My father gathered to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] with the Saints, and <br/>
he died there, aged 83 years.</p>

<p>The Patriarch also said I should be wrapt in the visions of <br/>
heaven, and an angel of God should teach me many things. <br/>
This was literally fulfilled.</p>

<p>Again, he told me I should be delivered from my enemies <br/>
(who would seek my destruction) by the mighty power of God</p>",
671.0,107,,"<p>STRUGGLE WITH EVIL SPIRITS.</p>

<p>and the administrations of angels. This was marvelously ful-<br/>
filled while in the city of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] in 1840. Brothers [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber <br/>
C. Kimball]], [[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]] and I went to London <br/>
together in the winter of 1840, being the first Elders who had <br/>
attempted to established the gospel in that great and mighty <br/>
city.</p>

<p>As soon as we commenced we found the [[Devil|devil]] was manifest; <br/>
the [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] gathered for our destruction, and at times they <br/>
had great power.</p>

<p>They would destroy all the Saints if they were not restrained <br/>
by the power of God.</p>

<p>Brother Smith and myself were together, and had retired <br/>
to our rest, each occupying a cot, and but three feet apart.</p>

<p>We had only just lain down, when it seemed as if a legion <br/>
of devils made war upon us, to destroy us, and we were strug-<br/>
gling for our lives in the midst of this warfare of evil spirits <br/>
until we were nearly choked to death.</p>

<p>I began to pray the best that I could in the midst of this <br/>
struggle and asked the Father in the name of Jesus Christ to <br/>
spare our lives.</p>

<p>While thus praying three personages entered the room, <br/>
clothed in white and encircled with light.</p>

<p>They walked to our bedside, laid hands upon our heads and <br/>
we were instantly delivered; and from that time forth we <br/>
were no more troubled with evil spirits while in the city of <br/>
London.</p>

<p>As soon as they administered unto us they withdrew from <br/>
the room, the lights withdrew with them and darkness <br/>
returned.</p>

<p>Many other sayings of the Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] in my <br/>
blessing have been fulfilled in my experience, but I have said <br/>
sufficient on this subject. All the blessings that are sealed <br/>
upon our heads will be fulfilled, and many more, if we are <br/>
faithful and live for them.</p>

<p>In closing my testimony I wish to say that I do not think <br/>
that the Lord ever sends an [[angel|angel]] to the earth to visit the <br/>
children of men, unless it is necessary to introduce a dispen-<br/>
sation of the gospel, or deliver a message, or perform a work <br/>
that cannot be done otherwise.</p>",
671.0,108,,"<p>THE END.</p>

<p>It required an [[Moroni (BofM)|angel]] of God to deliver the gospel to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph <br/>
Smith]] because it was not then upon the earth, and that was <br/>
in fulfillment of the word of the Lord through [[John (NT)|John]] the <br/>
Revelator (<i>##Revelation 14:6|Revelations xiv</i>. 6##). And so in regard to the <br/>
administrations of angels in all ages of the world; it is to <br/>
deliver a message and perform a work which cannot otherwise <br/>
be accomplished.<br/>

671.0,21,,"<p>REFUSED FOOD AND SHELTER.</p>

<p>In some instances the Lord preserved us, as it were by <br/>
miracle, from the mob.</p>

<p>We dared not go to houses and get food, so we picked and <br/>
ate raw corn, and slept on the ground, and did any way we <br/>
could until we got out of the [[Jackson County, Missouri|County]].</p>

<p>We dared not preach while in that County, and we did but <br/>
little preaching in the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]]. The first time I <br/>
attempted to preach was on Sunday, in a tavern, in the early <br/>
part of December, 1834. It was snowing at the time, and the <br/>
room was full of people. As I commenced to speak the land-<br/>
lord opened the door, and the snow blew on the people; and <br/>
when I inquired the object of having the door opened in a <br/>
snowstorm, he informed me that he wanted some light on the <br/>
subject. I found that it was the custom of the country.</p>

<p>How much good I did in that sermon I never knew, and <br/>
probably never shall know until I meet that congregation in <br/>
judgment.</p>

<p>In the southern portion of Missouri and the northern part <br/>
of [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], in 1834, there were but very few inhabitants.</p>

<p>We visited a place called [[Harmony Mission, Bates County, Missouri|Harmony Mission]], on the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage <br/>
river]], one of the most crooked rivers in the west. This mis-<br/>
sion was kept by a [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] minister and his family.</p>

<p>We arrived there on Sunday night at sunset. We had<br/>
walked all day with nothing to eat, and were very hungry and <br/>
tired. Neither the minister nor his wife would give us any-<br/>
thing to eat, nor let us stay overnight, because we were <br/>
“Mormons,"" and the only chance we had was to go twelve <br/>
miles farther down the river, to an [[Osage People|Osage]] Indian trading <br/>
post, kept by a Frenchman named [[Michel Geraud|Jereu]]. And this wicked <br/>
priest, who would not give us a piece of bread, lied to us <br/>
about the road, and sent us across the swamp, and we wallowed <br/>
knee deep in mud and water till ten o'clock at night in try-<br/>
ing to follow this crooked river. We then left the swamp, <br/>
and put out into the prairie, to lie in the grass for the night. <br/>
When we came out of the swamp, we heard an Indian <br/>
drumming on a tin pail and singing. It was very dark, but <br/>
we traveled towards the noise, and when we drew near the <br/>
Indian camp quite a number of large Indian dogs came out <br/>
to meet us. They smelt us, but did not bark nor bite.</p>",
671.0,22,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>We were soon surrounded by [[Osage People|Osage Indians]], and kindly <br/>
received by [[Michel Geraud|Mr. Jereu]] and his [[Mrs. Michael Geraud|wife]], who was an Indian. She <br/>
gave us an excellent supper and a good bed, which we were <br/>
thankful for after the fatigue of the day.</p>

<p>As I laid my head on my pillow I felt to thank God, from <br/>
the bottom of my heart, for the exchange of the barbarous <br/>
treatment of a civilized [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] priest, for the humane, <br/>
kind and generous treatment of the savage Osage Indians.</p>

BY A BEAR—PASS BY UNHARMED—SURROUNDED BY <br/>

ITS INMATES—NO SUPPER—SLEEP ON THE FLOOR—THE <br/>
HARDEST DAY'S WORK OF MY LIFE—TWELVE MILES <br/>
MORE WITHOUT BREAKFAST—BREAKFAST AND ABUSE <br/>
TOGETHER.</p>

<p>WE arose in the morning, after a good night's rest. I was <br/>
somewhat lame, from wading in the swamp the night <br/>
before. We had a good breakfast. [[Michel Geraud|Mr. Jereu]] sent an Indian <br/>
to see us across the [[Osage River, Missouri|river]], and informed us that it was sixty <br/>
miles to the nearest settlement of either white or red men.</p>

<p>We were too bashful to ask for anything to take with us to <br/>
eat; so we crossed the river and started on our day's journey <br/>
of sixty miles without a morsel of food of any kind. What <br/>
for? To preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, to save this gen-<br/>
eration.</p>

<p>Think of this, children; think of what the Presidency <br/>
the Apostles, and the Elders of this Church have passed <br/>
through to give you the homes and comforts you now enjoy.</p>

<p>Think of this, ye statesmen and judges of this American <br/>
nation; ye who are now seeking to destroy God's people in <br/>
the wilderness, who have gone hungry and naked and have <br/>
labored for fifty years to save this nation and generation.</p>",
671.0,23,,"<p>CONFRONTED BY A BEAR.</p>

<p>Cease your exertions to destroy this people, or God will bring <br/>
you to judgment and destroy your nation, and cast you into <br/>
[[outer darkness|outer darkness]], where there shall be weeping and gnashing of <br/>
teeth; for the Lord God has spoken it. I must pause; I almost <br/>
forgot I was writing a narrative.</p>

<p>We started about sunrise and crossed a thirty mile prairie, <br/>
apparently as level as a house floor, without shrub or water. <br/>
We arrived at timber about two o'clock in the afternoon. As <br/>
we approached the timber a large black bear came out towards <br/>
us. We were not afraid of him, for we were on the Lord's <br/>
business, and had not mocked God's prophets as did the forty-<br/>
two wicked children who said to [[Elisha (OT)|Elisha]] ""Go up thou bald<br/>
head,"" for which they were torn by bears.</p>

<p>When the bear got within eight rods of us he sat on his <br/>
haunches and looked at us a moment, and then ran away; and <br/>
we went on our way rejoicing. We had to travel in the night, <br/>
which was cloudy and very dark, so we had great difficulty to <br/>
keep the road. Soon a large drove of wolves gathered around, <br/>
and followed us. They came very close, and at times it <br/>
seemed as though they would eat us up.</p>

<p>We had materials for striking alight, and at ten o'clock, not <br/>
knowing where we were, and the wolves becoming so bold, we <br/>
thought it wisdom to make a fire; so we stopped and gathered <br/>
a lot of oak limbs that lay on the ground, and lit them, and <br/>
as our fire began to burn the wolves left us.</p>

<p>As we were about to lay down on the ground—for we had <br/>
no blankets—we heard a dog bark.</p>

<p>My [[Henry Brown|companion]] said it was a wolf; I said it was a dog: but <br/>
soon we heard a cow bell. Then we each took a firebrand and <br/>
went about a quarter of a mile, and found the house, which <br/>
was sixty miles from where we started that morning.</p>

<p>It was an old log cabin, about twelve feet square, with no <br/>
door, but an old blanket was hung up in the door-way. There <br/>
was no furniture except one bedstead, upon which lay a woman, <br/>
several children and several small dogs. A man lay on the <br/>
bare floor with his feet to the fireplace, and all were asleep. <br/>
I went in and spoke to the man, but did not wake him. I <br/>
stepped to him, and laid my hand on his shoulder. The <br/>
moment he felt the weight of my hand he jumped to his </p>",
671.0,24,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>feet, and ran around the room as though he was frightened; <br/>
but he was quieted when we informed him we were friends.</p>

<p>The cause of his fright was, he had shot a panther a few <br/>
nights before, and he thought its mate had jumped upon <br/>
him.</p>

<p>He asked us what we wanted; we told him we wished to <br/>
stop with him all night, and would like something to eat. He <br/>
informed us we might lay on the floor as he did, but that he <br/>
had not a mouthful for us to eat, as he had to depend on his <br/>
gun to get breakfast for his family in the morning. So we <br/>
lay on the bare floor, and slept through a long, rainy night, <br/>
which was pretty hard after walking sixty miles without any-<br/>
thing to eat. That was the hardest day's work of my life.</p>

<p>The man's name was Williams. He was in the mob in<br/>
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]; and after the Saints were driven out, he, <br/>
with many others, went south.</p>

<p>We got up in the morning and walked in the rain twelve <br/>
miles to the house of a man named Bemon, who was also <br/>
one of the mob from Jackson County. They were about <br/>
sitting down to breakfast as we came in.</p>

<p>In those days it was the custom of the Missourians to ask <br/>
you to eat even if they intended to cut your throat as soon as <br/>
you got through; so he asked us to take breakfast, and we <br/>
were very glad of the invitation.</p>

<p>OUR ANXIETY TO MEET A SAINT—JOURNEY TO AKEMAN'S—<br/>
A DREAM—FIND MR. AKEMAN A RANK APOSTATE—HE <br/>
RAISES A MOB—THREATENED WITH TAR, FEATHERS, <br/>
ETC.—I WARN MR. AKEMAN TO REPENT—HE FALLS DEAD <br/>
AT MY FEET—I PREACH HIS FUNERAL SERMON.</p>

<p>IN the early days of the Church, it was a great treat to an <br/>
Elder in his travels through the country to find a ""Mor-<br/>
mon;"" it was so with us. We were hardly in [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] when <br/>
we heard of a family named Akeman. They were in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson <br/>
County]] in the persecutions. Some of the sons had been tied <br/>
up there and whipped on their bare backs with hickory switches <br/>
by the mob. We heard of their living on [[Petit Jean River, Arkansas Territory|Petit Jean River]], in <br/>
the Arkansas Territory, and we went a long way to visit them.</p>

<p>There had recently been heavy rains, and a creek that we had <br/>
to cross was swollen to a rapid stream of eight rods in width. <br/>
There was no person living nearer than two miles from the <br/>
crossing, and no boat. The people living at the last house <br/>
on the road, some three miles from the crossing, said we would <br/>
have to tarry till the water fell before we could cross. We did <br/>
not stop, feeling to trust in God.</p>

<p>Just as we arrived at the rolling flood a [[Negro|negro]], on a powerful <br/>
horse, entered the stream on the opposite side and rode <br/>
through it. On our making our wants known to him, he took <br/>
us, one at a time, behind him and carried us safely over, and <br/>
we went on our way rejoicing.</p>

<p>We arrived that night within five miles of Mr. Akeman's, <br/>
and were kindly entertained by a stranger. During the <br/>
night I had the following dream:</p>

<p>I thought an angel came to us, and told us we were com-<br/>
manded of the Lord to follow a certain straight path, which <br/>
was pointed out to us, let it lead us wherever it might. After <br/>
we had walked in it awhile we came to the door of a house, <br/>
which was in the line of a high wall running north and south, <br/>
so that we could not go around. I opened the door and saw</p>",
671.0,26,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>the room was filled with large serpents, and I shuddered at <br/>
the sight. My [[Henry Brown|companion]] said he would not go into the room <br/>
for fear of the serpents. I told him I should try to go through <br/>
the room though they killed me, for the Lord had commanded <br/>
it. As I stepped into the room the serpents coiled themselves <br/>
up, and raised their heads some two feet from the floor, to <br/>
spring at me. There was one much larger than the rest in <br/>
the center of the room, which raised his head nearly as high <br/>
as mine and made a spring at me. At that instant I felt as <br/>
though nothing but the [[power of God|power of God]] could save me, and I <br/>
stood still. Just before the serpent reached me he dropped <br/>
dead at my feet; all the rest dropped dead, swelled up, turned <br/>
black, burst open, took fire and were consumed before my <br/>
eyes, and we went through the room unharmed, and thanked <br/>
God for our deliverance.</p>

<p>I awoke in the morning and pondered upon the dream. <br/>
We took breakfast, and started on our journey on Sunday <br/>
morning, to visit Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Akeman]]. I related to my companion <br/>
my dream, and told him we should see something strange. <br/>
We had great anticipations of meeting Mr. Akeman, suppos-<br/>
ing him to be a member of the Church. When we arrived at <br/>
his house he received us very coldly, and we soon found that <br/>
he had [[apostatized|apostatized]]. He brought railing accusations against <br/>
the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] and the authorities of the Church.</p>

<p>Word was sent through all the settlements on the river for <br/>
twenty miles that two ""Mormon"" preachers were in the place. <br/>
A mob was soon raised, and warning sent to us to leave <br/>
immediately or we would be tarred and feathered, ridden on a <br/>
rail and hanged. I soon saw where the serpents were. My <br/>
companion wanted to leave; I told him no, I would stay and <br/>
see my dream fulfilled.</p>

<p>There was an old [[Jonathan Hubbel|gentleman]] and [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|lady]], named Hubbel, who <br/>
had read the Book of Mormon and believed. Father Hubbell <br/>
came to see us, and invited us to make our home with him <br/>
while we stayed in the place. We did so, and labored for him <br/>
some three weeks with our axes, clearing land, while we were <br/>
waiting to see the salvation of God.</p>

<p>I was commanded of the Lord by the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] to go <br/>
and warn Mr. Akeman to repent of his wickedness. I did so, and</p>",
671.0,27,,""">11th of March, 1835</time>, we launched our <br/>
canoe, and commenced our voyage down the Arkansas river, <br/>
without provisions.</p>

<p>The first day we sailed twenty-five miles, and stopped at <br/>
night with a poor family who lived on the bank of the river. <br/>
These kind folks gave us supper and breakfast, and, in the <br/>
morning, gave us a [[johnnycake|johnny cake]] and piece of pork to take <br/>
with us on our journey.</p>",
671.0,28,,""">27th of March</time>, I arrived at Memphis, weary and <br/>
hungry. I went to the best tavern in the place, kept by Mr. <br/>
[[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]]. I told him I was a stranger, and had no <br/>
money. I asked him if he would keep me over night.</p>

<p>He inquired of me what my business was.</p>

<p>I told him I was a preacher of the gospel.</p>

<p>He laughed, and said that I did not look much like a <br/>
preacher.</p>",
671.0,29,,"<p>COMPELLED TO PREACH.</p>

<p>I did not blame him, as all the preachers he had ever been<br/>
acquainted with rode on fine horses or in fine carriages, clothed<br/>
in broadcloth, and had large salaries, and would see this<br/>
whole world sink to perdition before they would wade through<br/>
one hundred and seventy miles of mud to save the people.</p>

<p>The [[Josiah Jackson|landlord]] wanted a little fun, so he said he would<br/>
keep me if I would preach.  He wanted to see if I could<br/>
preach.</p>

<p>I must confess that by this time I became a little mischiev-<br/>
ous, and pleaded with him not to set me preaching.</p>

<p>The more I plead to be excused, the more determined Mr.<br/>
Jackson was that I should preach. He took my valise, and<br/>
the landlady got me a good supper.</p>

<p>I sat down in a large hall to eat supper. Before I got<br/>
through, the room began to be filled by some of the rich and<br/>
fashionable of [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], dressed in their broadcloth and<br/>
silk, while my appearance was such as you can imagine, after<br/>
traveling through the mud as I had been.</p>

<p>When I had finished eating, the table was carried out of<br/>
the room over the heads of the people. I was placed in the <br/>
corner of the room, with a stand having a [[Bible|Bible]], hymn book<br/>
and candle on it, hemmed in by a dozen men, with the land-<br/>
lord in the center.</p>

<p>There were present some five hundred persons who had<br/>
come together, not to hear a gospel sermon, but to have some<br/>
fun.</p>

<p>Now, boys, how would you like this position? On your <br/>
first mission, without a companion or friend, and to be called<br/>
upon to preach to such a congregation! With me it was<br/>
one of the most pleasing hours of my life, although I felt as<br/>
though I should like company.</p>

<p>I read a hymn, and asked them to sing. Not a soul would<br/>
sing a word.</p>

<p>I told them I had not the gift of singing; but with the<br/>
help of the Lord, I would both pray and preach. I knelt<br/>
down to pray, and the men around me dropped on their<br/>
knees. I prayed to the Lord to give me His Spirit and to <br/>
show me the hearts of the people. I promised the Lord in my <br/>
prayer I would deliver to that congregation whatever He</p>

<p><i>1</i>*</p>",
671.0,30,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>would give to me. I arose and spoke one hour and a half and<br/>
it was one of the best sermons of my life.</p>

<p>The lives of the congregation were opened to the vision of<br/>
my mind, and I told them of their wicked deeds and the<br/>
reward they would obtain. The men who surrounded me<br/>
dropped their heads. Three minutes after I closed I was the<br/>
only person in the room.</p>

<p>Soon I was shown to a bed, and in a room adjoining a large one<br/>
in which were assembled many of the men whom I had been <br/>
preaching to. I could hear their conversation.</p>

<p>One man said he would like to know how that ""Mormon""<br/>
boy knew of their past lives.</p>

<p>In a little while they got to disputing about some doctrinal<br/>
point. One suggested calling me to decide the point. The<br/>
[[Josiah Jackson|landlord]] said, ""no; we have had enough for once.""</p>

<p>In the morning, I had a good breakfast. The landlord said<br/>
if I came that way again to stop at his house, and stay as long<br/>
as I might choose.</p>

<p>AFTER leaving [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], I traveled through the country<br/>
to [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and preached on the way as I had<br/>
opportunity.</p>

<p>I stopped one night with a [[Squire Hardman|Squire Hardman]], an [[Episcopalian|Episco-<br/>

<p>Most of the night was spent by the family in music and <br/>

me if we believed in music and dancing.</p>",

under General [[George Washington|Washington]]. His [[Elizabeth Greenwood|wife]], who was ninety-three<br/>
years old, I found quite smart, and busy carding wool. I<br/>
preached at their house and baptized both of them. </p>",

<p>On the following day I preached at the house of Brother<br/>
Henry Thomas, when a mob of about fifty persons collected,<br/>
headed by a Baptist preacher, who, after asking one question,<br/>
advised the mob to not lay hands on any man on account of <br/>
his principles.</p>

671.0,35,,"<p>ELDER [[David Wyman Patten|PATTEN'S]] SPEECH.</p>

<p>brethren were condemned; but were finally released by paying<br/>
the expense of the mob court.</p>

<p>There was one peculiar circumstance connected with this<br/>
[[court trial|trial]] by a mob court, which was armed to the teeth. When<br/>
the trial was through with, the people were not willing to<br/>
permit more than one to speak. [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parish]] had said but<br/>
few words, and they were not willing to let David Patten<br/>
speak. But he, feeling the injustice of the court, and being<br/>
filled with the [[power of God|power of God]], arose to his feet and delivered a<br/>
speech of about twenty minutes, holding them spell-bound<br/>
while he told them of their wickedness and the abominations<br/>
that they were guilty of, also of the curse of God that awaited<br/>
them, if they did not repent, for taking up two harmless, <br/>
inoffensive men for preaching the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>When he had got through his speech the judge said, ""You<br/>
must be armed with secret weapons, or you would not talk in<br/>
this fearless manner to an armed court.""</p>

<p>Brother Patten replied; ""I have weapons that you know<br/>
not of, and they are given me of God, for He gives me all the<br/>
power I have.""</p>

<p>The judge seemed willing to get rid of them almost upon<br/>
any terms, and offered to dismiss them if their friends would<br/>
pay the costs, which the brethren present freely offered to do.</p>

<p>When the two were released, they mounted their horses and<br/>
rode a mile to [[Seth Utley|Seth Utley's]]; but, as soon as they had left, the<br/>
court became ashamed that they had been let go so easily<br/>
and the whole mob mounted their horses to follow them to<br/>
Utley's.</p>

<p>One of the Saints, seeing the state of affairs, went on<br/>
before the mob to notify the brethren, so that they had time<br/>
to ride into the woods near by.</p>

<p>They traveled along about three miles to Brother [[Albert Petty|Albert<br/>
Petty's]], and went to bed. The night was dark, and they fell <br/>
asleep.</p>

<p>But Brother Patten was warned in a dream to get up and <br/>
flee, as the mob would soon be there. They both arose,<br/>
saddled their animals, and rode into the adjoining County.</p>

<p>The house they had just left was soon surrounded by the<br/>
mob, but the brethren had escaped through the mercy of God.</p>",

<p>under the hands of Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]], the Patriarch, two <br/>
days later.</p>

<p>I felt impressed by the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] to take a mission <br/>
to the [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]], situated east of the [[Maine|Maine]] shore, a country I <br/>
knew nothing about. I made my feelings known to the <br/>
Apostles, and they advised me to go.</p>

<p>Feeling that it was my duty to go upon this mission, I did <br/>
not tarry at home one year after having married a [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]], as the <br/>
law of [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] would have allowed. On the contrary, I started <br/>
just one month and one day after that important event, leav-<br/>
ing my wife with Sister [[Olive Boynton Hale|Hale]], with whom she expected to <br/>
stay for a season.</p>

<p>I left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] in good spirits, in company with Elder <br/>
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan H. Hale]], and walked twelve miles to [[Fairport, Geauga County, Ohio|Fairport]], where we <br/>
were joined by Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. There we went aboard <br/>
the steamer <i>Sandusky</i>, and made our way to [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]], and pro-<br/>
ceeded thence to [[Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York|Syracuse]], by way of the [[Erie, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie Canal]]. We <br/>
then walked to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego Co., N. Y., where I met <br/>
my [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|two]] [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|brothers]], whom I had not seen for several years.</p>

<p>After spending one night there, we continued our journey <br/>
to [[Sackets Harbor, Jefferson County, New York|Sackett's Harbor]], and crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]] on the steamer <br/>
<i>Oneida</i>, to [[Kingston, Frontenac County, Canada West, British North America|Kingston]], Upper Canada, and from there also by <br/>
steamer along the canal to [[Jones Falls, Canada West, British North America|Jones' Falls]], whence we walked to <br/>
a place called [[Bastard, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Bastard]], Leeds County.</p>

<p>Here we found a branch of the Church, presided over by <br/>
[[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and [[James Blakesly|James Blakesly]]. We accompanied them <br/>
to their place of meeting, and attended a conference with <br/>
them, at which three hundred members of the Church were <br/>
represented.</p>

<p>Thirty-two persons presented themselves for ordination, <br/>
whom I was requested to ordain, in company with Elder [[William Draper|Wm. <br/>
Draper]]. We ordained seven Elders, nine Priests, eleven <br/>
Teachers and five Deacons.</p>

<p>We spoke to the people several times during this conf-<br/>
erence, and at its close we were called upon to administer to a <br/>
woman who was possessed of the devil. At times she was <br/>
dumb, and greatly afflicted with the [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] that dwelt in <br/>
her. She believed in Jesus and in us as His servants, and <br/>
wished us to administer to her. Four of us [[laying on of hands|laid]] our hands</p>",

Jesus Christ, to depart out of her. It was immediately done, <br/>
and the woman arose with great joy, and gave thanks and <br/>
praise unto God; for, according to her faith, she was made <br/>
whole from that hour.</p>

<p>A child, also, that was sick, was healed by the [[laying on of hands|laying on of <br/>

<p>We walked thirty miles to visit another branch of the <br/>
Saints at [[Leeds Township, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Leeds]], where we met with [[John Gordon|John Gordon]] and [[John Snider|John <br/>
Snider]]. Here we held a meeting and bore our testimony to <br/>
the people.</p>

<p>A Sister [[Irvin B. Carnes|Carns]] here came to us and requested to have the <br/>
ordinance for the healing of the sick performed for two of <br/>
her children who were afflicted. One was a suckling child, <br/>
which was lying at the point of death. I took it in my arms <br/>
and presented it before the Elders, who laid their hands upon <br/>
it, and it was made whole immediately, and I handed it back <br/>
to the mother entirely healed.</p>

<p>We afterwards laid hands upon the other, when it was also <br/>
healed. It was done by the [[power of God|power of God]], in the name of <br/>
Jesus Christ, and the parents praised God for His goodness.</p>

<p>After leaving the Saints in this place, we returned to [[Kingston, Frontenac County, Canada West, British North America|Kings-<br/>
ton]], and crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]] in company with [[Isaac Russell|Isaac Russell]], <br/>
[[John Goodson|John Goodson]] and John Snider.</p>

<p>Brother Russell seemed to be constantly troubled with [[evil spirits|evil <br/>

a mission to [[England|England]], where Apostles [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber <br/>

[[Schenectady, Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]], where they left us to proceed to [[New York|New York]], to <br/>
join Elders Kimball and Hyde to go upon their mission to <br/>
England.</p>

<p>After leaving these brethren we traveled by rail to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]], <br/>

<p>ABOUT nine months have elapsed since the first edition of <br/>
this work was published, and now the whole number <br/>
issued—over 4,000 copies—are exhausted, and there is a <br/>
demand for more.</p>

<p>We, therefore, have much pleasure in offering the Second <br/>
Edition of LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL for public consider-<br/>
ation, and trust that the young people who pursue it will be <br/>
inspired to emulate in their lives the faith, perseverance and <br/>
integrity that so distinguish its author.</p>

<p>Brother Woodruff is a remarkable man. Few men now <br/>
living, who have followed the quiet and peaceful pursuits of <br/>
life, have had such an interesting and eventful experience as <br/>
he has. Few, if any in this age, have spent a more active <br/>
and useful life. Certainly no man living has been more par-<br/>
ticular about recording with his own hand, in a daily journal, <br/>
during half a century, the events of his own career and the <br/>
things that have come under his observation. His elaborate <br/>
journal has always been one of the principal sources from <br/>
which the Church history has been compiled.</p>

<p>Possessed of wonderful energy and determination, and <br/>
mighty faith, Brother Woοkruff has labored long and with <br/>
great success in the Church. He has ever had a definite <br/>
object in view—to know the will of the Almighty and to do it. <br/>
No amount of self-denial has been too great for him to cheer-<br/>
fully endure for the advancement of the cause of God. No <br/>
labor required of the Saints has been considered by him too <br/>
onerous to engage in with his own hands.<br/>
</p>",
671.0,8,,"<p>PREFACE.</p>

<p>[[Satan|Satan]], knowing the power for good that Brother Woodruff<br/>
would be, if permitted to live, has often sought to effect his <br/>
destruction.</p>

<p>The adventures, accidents and hair-breath escapes that he <br/>
has met with, are scarcely equalled by the record that the for-<br/>
mer apostle, [[Paul (NT)|Paul]], has left us of his life.</p>

<p>The power of God has been manifested in a most remarkable <br/>
manner in preserving Brother Woodruf's life. Considering <br/>
the number of bones he has had broken, and the other bodily <br/>
injuries he has received, it is certainly wonderful that now, at <br/>
the age of seventy-five years, he is such a sound, well-pre-<br/>
served man. God grant that his health and usefulness may <br/>
continue for many years to come.</p>

<p>Of course, this volume contains but a small portion of the <br/>
interesting experience of Brother Woodruff's life, but very <br/>
many profitable lessons may be learned from it, and we trust <br/>
at some future time to be favored with other sketches from <br/>
his pen.</p>

<p>CHAPTR I.<br/>
STRICTNESS OF THE “BLUE LAWS"" OF [[Connecticut|CONNECTICUT]]—THE <br/>
OLD PROPHET, [[Robert Mason|MASON]]—HIS VISION—HIS PROPHECY—<br/>
HEAR THE GOSPEL, AND EMBRACE IT—VISIT [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|KIRTLAND]] <br/>
AND SEE [[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH SMITH]]—A WORK FOR THE OLD <br/>
PROPHET.</p>

<p>FOR the benefit of the young Latter-day Saints, for whom <br/>
the Faith-Promoting Series is especially designed, I will <br/>
relate some incidents from my experience. I will commence <br/>
by giving a short account of some events of my childhood <br/>
and youth.</p>

<p>I spent the first years of my life under the influence of what <br/>
history has called the ""[[Blue Laws|Blue Laws]]"" of Connecticut.</p>

<p>No man, boy, or child of any age was permitted to play, or <br/>
do any work from sunset Saturday night, until Sunday night. <br/>
After sunset on Sunday evening, men might work, and boys <br/>
might jump, shout, and play as much as they pleased.</p>

<p>Our parents were very strict with us on Saturday night, <br/>
and all day Sunday we had to sit very still and say over the <br/>
[[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] catechism and some passages in the [[Bible|Bible]].</p>

<p>The people of Connecticut in those days thought it wicked <br/>
to believe in any religion, or belong to any church, except the <br/>
Presbyterian. They did not believe in having any prophets, <br/>
apostles, or revelations, as they had in the days of Jesus, and <br/>
as we now have in the [[Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day <br/>
Saints]].</p>

<p>There was an aged man in Connecticut, however, by the <br/>
name of [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], who did not believe like the rest of <br/>
the people. He believed it was necessary to have prophets</p>",
671.0,14,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>apostles, dreams, visions and revelations in the church of <br/>
Christ, the same as they had who lived in ancient days; and <br/>
he believed the Lord would raise up a people and a church, <br/>
in the last days, with prophets, apostles and all the gifts, <br/>
powers and blessings, which it ever contained in any age of <br/>
the world.</p>

<p>The people called this man, the old prophet [[Robert Mason|Mason]].</p>

<p>He frequently came to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house when I was a <br/>
boy, and taught me and my brothers those principles; and I <br/>
believed him.</p>

<p>This prophet prayed a great deal, and he had dreams and <br/>
visions, and the Lord showed him many things, by visions, <br/>
which were to come to pass in the last days.</p>

<p>I will here relate one vision, which he related to me. The <br/>
last time I ever saw him, he said: ""I was laboring in my <br/>
field at mid-day when I was enwrapped in a vision. I was <br/>
placed in the midst of a vast forest of fruit trees: I was <br/>
very hungry, and walked a long way through the orchard, <br/>
searching for fruit to eat; but I could not find any in the <br/>
whole orchard, and I wept because I could find no fruit. <br/>
While I stood gazing at the orchard, and wondering why <br/>
there was no fruit, the trees began to fall to the ground upon <br/>
every side of me, until there was not one tree standing in the <br/>
whole orchard; and while I was marveling at the scene, I saw <br/>
young sprouts start up from the roots of the trees which had <br/>
fallen, and they opened into young, thrifty trees before my <br/>
eyes. They budded, blossomed, and bore fruit until the trees <br/>
were loaded with the finest fruit I ever beheld, and I rejoiced<br/>
to see so much fine fruit. I stepped up to a tree and picked <br/>
my hands full of fruit, and marveled at its beauty, and as <br/>
I was about to taste of it the vision closed, and I found <br/>
myself in the field in the same place I was at the commence-<br/>
ment of the vision.</p>

<p>""I then knelt upon the ground, and prayed unto the Lord, <br/>
and asked Him, in the name of Jesus Christ, to show me the <br/>
meaning of the vision. The Lord said unto me: 'This is the <br/>
interpretation of the vision: the great trees of the forest <br/>
represented the generation of men in which you live. There is <br/>
no church of Christ, or [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]] upon the earth in </p>",
671.0,15,,"<p>I EMBRACE THE GOSPEL.</p>

<p>your generation. There is no fruit of the church of Christ<br/>
upon the earth. There is no man ordained of God to<br/>
administer in any of the ordinances of the gospel of salvation<br/>
upon the earth in this day and generation. But, in the next<br/>
generation, I the Lord will set up my kingdom and my church<br/>
upon the earth, and the fruits of the kingdom and church of<br/>
Christ, such as have followed the prophets, apostles and saints<br/>
in every dispensation, shall again be found in all their fullness<br/>
upon the earth. You will live to see the day, and handle the<br/>
fruit; but will never partake of it in the flesh.' ""</p>

<p>When the old [[Robert Mason|prophet]] had finished relating the vision and<br/>
interpretation, he said to me, calling me by my christian<br/>
name: ""I shall never partake of this fruit in the flesh; but<br/>
you will, and you will become a conspicuous actor in that<br/>
kingdom."" He then turned and left me. These were the<br/>
last words he ever spoke to me upon the earth.</p>

<p>This was a very striking circumstance, as I had spent many<br/>
hours and days, during twenty years, with this old Father<br/>
Mason, and he had never named this vision to me before.<br/>
But at the beginning of this last conversation, he told me that<br/>
he felt impelled by the Spirit of the Lord to relate it to me.</p>

<p>He had the vision about the year 1800, and he related it to<br/>
me in 1830—the same spring that the Church was organized.</p>

<p>This vision, with his other teachings to me, made a great<br/>
impression upon my mind, and I prayed a great deal to the<br/>
Lord to lead me by His Spirit, and prepare me for His church<br/>
when it did come.</p>

<p>In 1832, I left [[Connecticut|Connecticut]], and traveled with my eldest<br/>
[[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|brother]] to [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]], New York; and in the winter of<br/>
1833, I saw, for the first time in my life, an [[Zerah Pulsipher|Elder]] of the<br/>
[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. He preached<br/>
in a school-house near where I lived. I attended the meet-<br/>
ing, and the Spirit of the Lord bore record to me that what<br/>
I heard was true. I invited the Elder to my house, and next<br/>
day I, with my eldest brother, went down into the water and<br/>
was baptized. We were the first two baptized in Oswego<br/>
County, New York.</p>

<p>When I was baptized I thought of what the old prophet<br/>
had said to me.</p>",
671.0,16,,""">27th of April</time>, I attended a meeting in a<br/>
school-house in Kirtland, and for the first time heard Elders<br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and others speak<br/>
and bear testimony to the work of God, and much of the<br/>
Spirit of God was poured out upon the Saints.</p>",

sisted of about one hundred and thirty men. On the follow-</p>",
671.0,18,,""">24th of June, 1834</time>, and we pitched our tents<br/>
on the premises. He told some of the brethren of my com-<br/>
pany that he had a spare room that some of us might occupy<br/>
if we would clean it. Our company accepted the offer, and,<br/>
fearing some other company would get it first, left all other</p>",
671.0,19,,"<p>REWARD OF SELFISHNESS.</p>

<p>business and went to work, cleaning out the room, and imme-<br/>
diately spread down our blankets, so as to hold a right to the<br/>
room. It was but a short time afterwards that our brethren,<br/>
who were attacked by [[cholera|cholera]], were brought in and laid upon<br/>
our beds. None of us ever used those blankets again, for they<br/>
were buried with the dead. So we gained nothing but expe-<br/>
rience by being selfish, and we lost our bedding.</p>

<p>I will exhort all my young friends to not cherish selfishness;<br/>
but if you have any, get rid of it as soon as possible. Be<br/>
generous and noble-hearted, kind to your parents, brothers,<br/>
sisters and play-mates. Never contend with them; but try to<br/>
make peace whenever you can. Whenever you are blessed<br/>
with any good thing, be willing to share it with others. By<br/>
Cultivating these principles while you are young, you will lay<br/>
a foundation to do much good through your lives, and you<br/>
will be beloved and respected of the Lord and all good men.</p>

<p>AFTER [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], the Prophet, had led [[Zion|Zion's Camp]] to Mis-<br/>
souri, and we had passed through all the trials of that<br/>
journey, and had buried a number of our brethren, as recorded<br/>
in history, the Prophet called the Camp together, and organ<br/>
ized the Church in Zion, and gave much good counsel to all.</p>

<p>He advised all the young men, who had no families, to stay<br/>
in Missouri and not return to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. Not having any family,<br/>
I stopped with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], as did [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and </p>",
671.0,20,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>[[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]]. We spent the summer together, laboring<br/>
hard, cutting wheat, quarrying rock, making brick, or anything<br/>
else we could find to do.</p>

<p>In the fall I had a desire to go and preach the gospel. I<br/>
knew the gospel which the Lord had revealed to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]<br/>
was true, and of such great value that I wanted to tell it to<br/>
the people who had not heard it. It was so good and plain,<br/>
it seemed to me I could make the people believe it.</p>

<p>I was but a [[Teacher|Teacher]], and it is not a Teacher's office to go<br/>
abroad and preach. I dared not tell any of the authorities of<br/>
the Church that I wanted to preach, lest they might think I<br/>
was seeking for an office.</p>

<p>I went into the woods where no one could see me, and I<br/>
prayed to the Lord to open my way so that I could go and<br/>
preach the gospel. While I was praying, the Spirit of the<br/>
Lord came upon me, and told me my prayer was heard and<br/>
that my request should be granted.</p>

<p>I felt very happy, and got up and walked out of the woods<br/>
into the traveled road, and there I met a [[High Priest|High Priest]] who<br/>
had lived in the same house with me some six months.</p>

<p>He had not said a word to me about preaching the gospel;<br/>
but now, as soon as I met him, he said, ""the Lord has revealed<br/>
to me that it is your privilege to be ordained, and to go and<br/>
preach the gospel.”</p>

<p>I told him I was willing to do whatever the Lord required<br/>
of me. I did not tell him I had just asked the Lord to let<br/>
me go and preach.</p>

<p>In a few days a council was called at [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight's]], and I<br/>
was ordained a [[Priest|Priest]] and sent on a mission into [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] and<br/>
[[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in company with an [[Henry Brown|Elder]]. This mission was given<br/>
us by Elder [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]], who was the first [[Bishop|Bishop]]<br/>
ordained in the Church.</p>

<p>The law of God to us in those days was to go without purse<br/>
or scrip. Our journey lay through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], from<br/>
which the Saints had just been driven, and it was dangerous<br/>
for a ""Mormon"" to be found in that part of the [[Missouri|State]].</p>

<p>We put some [[Book of Mormon|Books of Mormon]] and some clothing into our<br/>
valises, strapped them on our backs, and started on foot. We<br/>
Crossed the ferry into Jackson County, and went through it.</p>",
3.0,1,,""">19</time>—Mr. Jerrew gave us a good breakfast, <br/>
put us across the Osage river in a canoe, and <br/>
we started upon our long day's walk, it being <br/>
sixty miles to the nearest house; we had not <br/>
anything with us to eat. Most of our travels <br/>
through the day was through prairie; before <br/>
dark we entered timbered land; as we ap-<br/>
proached the timber a large black bear met <br/>
us; we had no weapons. When the bear got <br/>
within about six rods of us, he rose upon hi[s]<br/>
hind feet and examined us a short time, an[d]<br/>
went off. We were soon enveloped in su[ch] [page folded]</p>

Twelve Apostles, and other quorums, met in <br/>
solemn assembly, and sealed upon our heads,<br/>
our washings, anointings and blessings with a <br/>
loud shout of [[Hosanna Shout|hosannah]] to God and the Lamb;<br/>
the Spirit of the Lord rested upon us. After <br/>
spending three hours in the upper room, the <br/>
quorums repaired to the lower court; the vails <br/>
were lowered, and the ordinance of [[washing of feet|washing <br/>

been imprisoned in jail on pretence of debt,<br/>
but in reality out of religious persecution. <br/>
The jailor locked me in until ten p.m.; but <br/>

<p>I bought a log house of brother [[Moses Tracy|Tracy]], on<br/>

Streets. Prest. Joseph Smith afterwards gave<br/>

",
3.0,5,,""">29th</time> was another trying day to my life; the <br/>
poison had so thoroughly penetrated my whole <br/>
system, that my strength left me; I could not <br/>
stand, I was led to my bed, my bowels and <br/>
stomach ceased to act, my speech was like <br/>
that of a drunken man. Prest. Young called, <br/>
in company with [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Dr. Sprague]], and laid hands <br/>
upon me, and rebuked the disease and the</p>

body, and promised me in the name of the<br/>
Lord, that I should not die but live to finish<br/>
my work which was appointed me upon the<br/>
earth. I soon began to recover. The poison<br/>
and mortification left my system and centered<br/>
in my arm, and was drawn from my arm thro' <br/>
the aid of charcoal poultices, moistened with <br/>
a strong decoction of wormwood, ragweed and <br/>
wild sage; the dead flesh was removed from <br/>
my arm with instruments and lunar caustic,<br/>
and in a few days I was well again.</p>

<br/>
<p>I have occupied considerable space in refer-<br/>
ring to those peculiar circumstances which <br/>
have attended me during life, and to sum the <br/>
matter up it stand thus:—I have broken both <br/>
legs—one in two places—both arms, my breast<br/>
bone and three ribs, and had both ankles dis-<br/>
located. I have been drowned, frozen, scalded, <br/>
and bit by a mad dog—have been in water <br/>
wheels under full head of water—-have passed <br/>
through several severe fits of sickness, and <br/>
encountered poison in its worst forms—have <br/>
landed in a pile of railroad ruins—have barely <br/>
been missed by the passing bullet, and have <br/>
passed through a score of other hair-breadth<br/>
escapes.</p>

<br/>
<p>It has appeared miraculous to me, that with<br/>
all the injuries and broken bones which I have<br/>
had, I have not a lame limb, but have been <br/>
enabled to endure the hardest labor, exposures<br/>
and journeys—have often walked forty, fifty, <br/>
and on one occasion, sixty miles in a day. The <br/>
protection and mercy of God has been over <br/>
me, and my life thus far has been preserved; <br/>
for which blessings I feel to render the grati-<br/>

<p>Chapter of Accidents<br/>
written [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|G. S. L. City]] February, 1858</p>

<p>Varied and diverse are the lives and fortunes<br/>
of men, while the paths of some are strew<strike>e</strike>n with <br/>
flowers and ease from the cradle to the grave<br/>
with naught to disturbe their peace, others apparen<br/>
tly are marked victims of vari<strike>at</strike>ed misfortunes, <br/>
accidents, and dangers; the last named class is <br/>
the one, in whose ranks I have <strike>stoood</strike> stood, thro'<br/>
my infancy, childhood, youth &amp; manhood, up to <br/>
the present time, so ^much so,^ that it has seemed as though <br/>
some invis<s>a</s>ible power or fate was watching my <br/>
^foot^steps, in order to find some opportunity to take <br/>
my life from the earth; I can only attribute <br/>
the continuation of my life <strike>on Earth</strike> to the present <br/>
time, to a merciful God, whose hand has been <br/>
stretched out and rescued me from death in <br/>
the midst of many ^of the^ many dangers and hair breadth <br/>
escapes, I have passed through, some of <br/>
which I will here mention. When 3 years of age <br/>
I fell into a caldron of boiling water, was instantly <br/>
caught out, but was so badly scalded, that it was <br/>
nine months <strike>f</strike>before I was considered out of <br/>
danger. <strike>When</strike> at 5 years of age, I fell from the great <br/>
beam of a barn <strike>rafters</strike> ^striking^ my <strike>bare</strike> face upon the <br/>
floor, which came near breaking my neck. Three <br/>
months afterwards, I broke one of my arms, by falling <br/>
down a pair of stairs; I soon after broke my other <br/>
arm by falling out of a high stoop, upon a pile <br/>
of timber. When six years of age, I came near <br/>
being killed by a surly Bull. <strike>^see people apart^</strike> <strike>and was only saved</strike><br/>
<strike>by as it were by a miracle,</strike> ^¶^ <s>d</s>Durring the same year, I went into my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|fathers]] saw mill, with several <br/>
others. I got upon the headblock to take a ride <br/>
while the carriage was running back, not anticipating <br/>
any danger, <strike>but</strike> <strike>before I was aware,</strike> my leg was caught </p>",
371.0,2,,"<p>between the headblock and the fender post, and broke <br/>
both bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken to the <br/>
house and lay nine hours before my bones were <br/>
set, <strike>which time was spent amidst</strike> ^suffering severe pain, but <br/>
being young my bones soon knit<s>t</s> together and in <br/>
a few days, I was again upon my feet; during <br/>
my confinement, by this lameness, my bro., [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]], <br/>
was my companion in the same room <strike>going through</strike> with <br/>
<strike>a course of</strike> the typhus fever. When 7 years of age, I was <br/>
riding on the top of a load of hay, which my uncle,<br/>
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozen Woodruff]], was driving to the barn, he turned <br/>
the load over upon me. I was nearly strangled for <br/>
the want of air, before the hay was removed. ^¶^At 8 <br/>
years <strike>of age</strike> ^old^ I was riding in a one horse wagon with <br/>
several others, the horse took fright ran down a <br/>
steep hill and turned the wagon over upon us; but <br/>
again while in the midst of danger my life was pre-<br/>
served; none of us were seriously injured. When 9 years <br/>
^old^ I climbed into an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon <br/>
a dry limb, which broke and I fell about 15 feet upon <br/>
my back which beat the breath out of my body, a cousin <br/>
ran and told my parents I was dead; before they <br/>
arrived at the spot, I came to my senses and met <br/>
<strike>my parents</strike> ^them^ <strike>coming to me</strike>. When 12 years of age <br/>
I was [[drowned|drownd]] in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington <strike>R</strike>river]], and sunk <br/>
in 30 ft of water, and after carrying one person <br/>
to the bottom with me, I was miraculously saved <br/>
by a young man named [[John Bacon|Bacon]] <strike>by</strike> diving to the <br/>
bottom, and carrying with him a large stone, to <s>holld</s> hold <br/>
him down until he obtained my body, not expecting <br/>
to save <strike>my</strike> <strike>life</strike> ^me alive^: I suffered much in being restored to <br/>
life: ^at 13 years of age^ While passing through [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington meadows]], in the <br/>
depth of winter, the roads were drifted with snow, and in <br/>
an exceedingly blustering day I became so chilled and </p>",
371.0,3,,"<p>overcome with cold, ^so that^ I could not travel. I crawled <br/>
into the hollow of a large apple tree a man in the <br/>
distance seeing me go into ^it^ <strike>the tree</strike> hastened to my <br/>
rescue, realizing my danger more fully than I did<br/>
when he arrived at the spot I had fallen asleep and <br/>
was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in arousing <br/>
me to a sense of my situation, he procured means <br/>
to carry me to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house, and through <br/>
a kind providence my life was again preserved. <br/>
At 14 years of age, I split my left instep open with an ax <br/>
which went nearly through my foot; <strike>and</strike> it was 9 months getting <br/>
well. At 15 year of age, I was bitten in my left hand <br/>
by a mad dog in the last stage of hydrophobia; he only <br/>
dented my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood &amp; <br/>
I was again preserved through the mercies of God <br/>
from an awful death. At the age of 17, <s>I met</s><br/>
<s>with an accident which caused me much suffering</s><br/>
<s>and came near ending my life,</s> I was riding a <br/>
very ill tempered horse, which I was not acquainted <br/>
with, and while going down a very steep ^rocky^ hill, the <br/>
horse <strike>took</strike> <strike>the</strike> ^taking^ advantage of the ground, suddenly <br/>
leaped from the <strike>ground</strike> ^road^, and ran down the <br/>
steep<strike>est part of it</strike> <strike>^the hill^</strike>, amid <strike>the roughest of</strike> the rocks <br/>
at full speed, and commenced kicking up <strike>at</strike> <br/>
<strike>the same time,</strike> and attempted to throw me over <br/>
his head upon the rocks, but I lodged upon the top <br/>
of his head grasped hold of each ear, as with <br/>
a death grasp, expecting every moment to be dashed <br/>
to pieces <strike>among</strike> ^against^ the rocks, while in this position <br/>
sitting astride of his neck with no bridle to guide <br/>
him but his ears, he plunged down the hill under <br/>
full speed until he ran against a rock, <strike>which</strike> ^and^<br/>
dashed <s>him</s> to the ground. I went over both his head <strike>on</strike> <br/>
and the rock, about one rod, and struck the ground <br/>
square on my feet, being the only thing visible that </p>",
371.0,4,,"<p>saved my life, for had I struck upon any other part <br/>
of my body, it must have killed me instantly, as it was <br/>
my bones crushed from under me as though they were <br/>
reeds, it broke my left leg <strike>twice</strike> in two places and <br/>
put out both my ankles in a shocking manner<br/>
and the Horse came near rolling over me in his <br/>
struggles to get up; my uncle, [[Titus Woodruff|Titus Woodruff]], saw <br/>
me fall got assistance <strike>me</strike> and carried me to his house<br/>
I lay from 2 <strike>O'clock</strike> ^pm^ till 10 <strike>at night</strike> without medical aid <br/>
then my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] arrived bringing Dr [[Dr. Swift|Swift]] of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] <br/>
with him who set my bones boxed up my limbs and carried <br/>
me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my fathers;<br/>
my sufferings were very great <strike>yet</strike> I had good attention <br/>
and in 8 weeks I was out doors upon my crutches. <br/>
In 1827 while attempting to clear the ice out of a <br/>
water wheel; standing upon the wheel with one arm <br/>
around the shaft; a man hoisted the gate and <br/>
let a full head of water upon it, as soon as the <br/>
water struck the wheel <strike>it</strike> ^the wheel^ it started, my feet slipped into the wheel <br/>
I immediately plunged head <strike>long</strike> foremost over the <br/>
rim <strike>of the wheel</strike> into about 3 feet of water and my <br/>
weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I should <br/>
have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to <br/>
death. In 1831 while having charge of the flouring <br/>
mill in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsville]] Ct. I was standing inside of a breast <br/>
wheel 20 ft. in diameter, upon one of the arms near the <br/>
top, clearing out the ice, when a full head of water <br/>
was let on to it, it immediately started; but I droped my <br/>
ax and leaped through the wheel to the bottom of it, by <br/>
the shaft and arms about 20 feet: as I struck the bottom <br/>
of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone <br/>
wall with only about 2 feet <strike>of water</strike> clearance <br/>
between it and the wheel, the wheel caught me and <br/>
rolled me out into the water below where I found myself <br/>
with-out any bones broken, but with some bruses and much fright.  </p>",
371.0,5,,"<p>During the winter of 1831, while in [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New hartford]], Ct. <br/>
I passed through a severe <strike>fit of sickness</strike> course of <br/>
lung fever. In 1833, the day I was baptized <s>into the church</s><br/>
<s>of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints;</s> one of my horses, newly <br/>
<strike>caught</strike> ^sharp shod^, kicked my hat off my head and had he struck <br/>
2 inches lower, would probably have killed me instantly, <br/>
in 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same team <br/>
down a hill on a sleigh without any box the bottom <br/>
boards slipped forward under the roller and caught <br/>
the ground, turned end ways and fell on the horses' <br/>
backs, ^throwing me <strike>between</strike>^ between the horses, they ran to the bottom of the <br/>
hill dragging me <strike>by</strike> ^with^ the lines, head foremost with <br/>
the sleigh on top of me about 20 rods over a smooth <br/>
snow path, I escaped unharmed however, in the <br/>
midst of both dangers. In 1834 while traveling in <br/>
[[Zion|Zion's camp]] in [[Missouri|Mo.]] a rifle was accidentally discharged <br/>
and the ball passed through 3 tents with about 12 men <br/>
in each, and lodged in a wagon axletree while a <br/>
man was standing behind it, <strike>it</strike> ^and^ injured no one <br/>
^it^ passed within a few inches of my breast, and many <br/>
others escaped as narrowly as myself: a few months <br/>
afterwards a musket heavily loaded with buckshot was accident<s>l</s>ally snapped <br/>
with the muzzle pointed at my breast within a few<br/>
<strike>few</strike> feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot, it <br/>
had a good flint and ^was^ well primed, but it missed fire <br/>
and my life was a gain preserved. In April 1839 <br/>
in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] Ills. I was riding upon the running <br/>
gears of a wagon without a box, <strike>I was</strike> sitting upon <br/>
the forward axletree, the bolt came out, fastening <br/>
the copuling pole, which left the hind wheels, and <br/>
my weight on the forward bolster and tongue<br/>
turned the copuling pole, clear over onto the <br/>
horses backs, turned the stakes upside down</p>",

left [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]], on the express train for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]<br/>

of Israel building up [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|winter quarters]] on the west <br/>
side of the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri river]], (then Indian country,) I <br/>
passed through one of the most painful and serious <br/>
misfortunes <strike>I ever</strike> of any of my life I took my axe <br/>
and went two and a half miles on to the bluffs, to <br/>
cut some shingle timber to cover my <strike>shanty</strike> cabin <br/>
I was accompanied by two <strike>other</strike> men and while <br/>
<strike>falling</strike> the 3rd tree<s>s</s> ^was falling^ which was an oak over 2 ft <br/>
diameter I stepped behind it some 10 feet, and also <br/>
to one side the same distance, where I thought I <br/>
was entirely out of danger, but when the tree fell <br/>
there being a crook in the body of it, ^which^ struck a knoll <br/>
on the ground <strike>when</strike> the whole body shot endways <br/>
back of the stump and bounded, and the butt of the <br/>
tree struck me on the breast, and knocked me several <br/>
feet into the air, ^against a standing oak^ and the falling tree followed me <br/>
in its bound and caught me against the standing <br/>
tree and I came down between the them, before <br/>
reaching the ground I was liberated from them <br/>
and struck the ground upon my feet, badly bru^i^sed <br/>
my left thigh the whole length of it and my hip <br/>
<strike>also</strike> ^and^ my left arm, it also broke my breast bone <br/>
also 3 ribs on my left side also bruised my lungs, <br/>
vitals and left side were also bruised in a shocking manner. <br/>
after the accident I sat upon a log until M<s><u>r</u></s><br/>
[[John Garrison|Mo Garrison]] went a quarter of a mile to get my <br/>
horse; notwithstanding I was so badly hurt I had </p>",
371.0,8,,""">28</time> my arm began <br/>
to swell, was in great pain and showed signs</p>",
371.0,9,,""">29th</time> was another trying day to my life, the poison<br/>
had so thoroughly penetrated my whole system that<br/>
my strength left me I could not stand, I was led<br/>
to my bed, my bowels and stomach ceased to<br/>
act, my speech was like that of a drunken man<br/>
Prest. Young called in<strike>to</strike> company with [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Dr Sprague]]<br/>
and laid hands upon me and rebuked the disease<br/>
and the power of the [[destroyer|distroyer]] which had sceized<br/>
my body and promised me in the name of the<br/>
Lord, that I should not die but live to finish<strike>ed</strike><br/>
my work which was appointed me, upon the<br/>
Earth. I soon began to recover; the poison and<br/>
mortification left my <strike>body</strike> system and centered<br/>
in my arm, and was drawn from my arm<br/>
through the aid of charcoal poultices, moistened<br/>
with a strong decoction of wormwood rag weed<br/>
and wild sage; the dead flesh was removed<br/>
from my arm with instruments and lunar caustic<br/>
and in a few days I was well again.</p>

<p>I have occupied considerable space in refering<br/>
to those peculiar circumstances, which have attended<br/>
me during life, and to sum the matter up, it stands<br/>
thus: I have broken both legs, one <strike>twice in two</strike> ^in two places^, both<br/>
arms, <strike>both ankles,</strike> <strike>^dislocated^</strike> my breast bone and three ribs, ^and ^had^ both ankles dislocated^<br/>

a mad dog; have been in two water wheels under<br/>
full head of water; have passed through several<br/>
severe fits of sickness; <sup>&amp;</sup> encountered poison in its<br/>
worst forms; have landed in a pile of rail-road ruins</p>",

me, but have been enabled to endure the hardest<br/>
labor, exposures and journeys, have often<br/>
walked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles in a<br/>
day. The protection and mercy of God has been<br/>
over me and my life thus far has been preserved<br/>

</p><p>I have hastily noticed in the foregoing pages some of the leading circumstances<br/>
of my life, up to the time of my entering the ranks of the Servants of <br/>
God. In looking it over I find many imperfections but as it was written<br/>
some time since and in great haste I shall let it remain for the<br/>
present and continue my narrative beg<s>g</s>inning where I<br/>
left off</p>

<br/>
<p> When I entered the ranks of Gods people and first commenced<br/>
the Christians warfare I had but faint ideas of the narrowness<br/>
of that Way, and but little realized that it was as strait a<br/>
way as the scriptures represent it to be, that but few should<br/>
find &amp; walk in it. Much less did I in my weakness conceive<br/>
the many artful &amp; cunning devices of Satan to draw the<br/>
[[child of God|child of God]] from the paths of holiness I had not yet learnt<br/>
by experience that the Devil like a roaring Lion goeth about<br/>
seeking whom he may devour and that he grasps with his<br/>
deadly claws every one that turns aside from the Highway<br/>
of Holiness. But as I turned and set my face Zion ward and<br/>
began to take up my march thither I soon began to hear<br/>
the — at first but whispered suggestions of the Adversary trying to<br/>
win me back to his service and I soon began to feel his firey<br/>
darts levelled and hurled at me from almost every quarter<br/>
I soon found that I had enlisted as a Soldier in a warfare<br/>
and that I must act not only the offensive but likewise<br/>
the defensive part and if I would gain the prize I must<br/>
fight. But I had yet (as a raw undiciplined recruit) to learn the<br/>
use of the armour with which Christians fight their battles<br/>
and from whom I could expect help from trouble</p>

<br/>
<p>I could not wield with ease the Sword of the Spirit and the<br/>
Shield of Faith though a comfortable garment ^&amp; armour^, did not fit<br/>
my body Shapen and conceive in Sin, in fine the garments<br/>
of Salvation could not be expected to fit perfectly, and set<br/>
with ease on one who had so long been clothed with shame<br/>
and clad with the filthy garments of Unrighteousness<br/>
But I had yet to learn of My Captain, of Him who is meek<br/>
and lowly some simple &amp; humble lessons of Christianity<br/>
before I could make much resistance with the enemy<br/>
in case of an open attack. Encouraging thought that<br/>
the Captain of our Salvation being in all points tempted<br/>
as we are is able to succour those that are tempted<br/>
and that he will with every temptation provide<br/>
a way for our escape</p>

through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson county]], as it lay in<br/>
our route. He replied, it would be at <br/>
the risk of life, and he had not faith <br/>
enough to undertake it; if I had, I <br/>
might try it. I also asked him, if I <br/>

judgments might rest upon the wicked<br/>
who had shed the blood of the Saints<br/>

were ""Mormons."" It was fifteen<br/>
miles to the nearest house, which was <br/>

shout at the trading house, as they</p>

mud, hungry and weary, and were<br/>
kindly received and entertained for <br/>
the remainder of the night by Mr. <br/>

a large fire, and we slept comfortably. <br/>

263.0,8,,""">June [January] 19</time>—Mr. [[Michel Geraud|Jerrew]] gave us a <br/>
good breakfast, put us across the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage <br/>

our long day's walk, it being sixty <br/>
miles to the nearest house. We had<br/>
not anything with us to eat. Most of <br/>
our travels through the day was<br/>
through prairie; before dark we en-<br/>
tered timbered land; as we approached <br/>
the timber, a large black bear met us; <br/>
we had no weapons. When the bear got<br/>
within about six rods of us, he rose upon<br/>
his hind feet, and examined us a short <br/>
time, and went off. We were soon<br/>
enveloped in such thick darkness, that <br/>
it was with great difficulty we could <br/>
keep the road, and surrounded by a<br/>
large drove of wolves, which kept up <br/>
a continual howling, and would fre-<br/>
quently rush to within a few feet of us. <br/>
We travelled about two hours in this <br/>
situation, feeling that we were in <br/>
danger, and concluded to stop and <br/>
build a fire, and wait till morning.<br/>
Accordingly, we built a large fire,<br/>
which drove the wolves off; and as <br/>
we were about to lie down, we heard<br/>
a dog bark, and a bell. We felt <br/>

<p>We arrived at [[Cedar Creek, Petit Jean, Conway County, Arkansas Territory|Petty John Creek]], in <br/>
Arkansas, where Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Alexander Ake-<br/>
man]] resided, with a large family of <br/>
[[William Akeman|son]]s and [[Delilah Adaline Akeman Gibbs|one daughter]], settled around <br/>
him. Mr. Akeman, and a part of the <br/>
family, were members of the Church<br/>
in Jackson county; [[Prudence Stockton Akeman|his wife]] died<br/>
strong in the faith in Missouri. His<br/>
whole family were mobbed, and some<br/>
of [[Wright Akeman|his son]]s were whipped severely;<br/>
but he could not stand the persecution <br/>
and the loss of his property. He<br/>
moved to Arkansas, to get rid of <br/>
""Mormonism,"" had apostatized, and <br/>
was bitter against the Work. When<br/>
we called upon him, he opposed us <br/>
strongly—spoke against the leaders of <br/>
the Church and the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]]. <br/>
He had one son who received us, and <br/>
had a little faith. I dreamed the <br/>
night before, that we were required to<br/>
walk in a straight, narrow path; and <br/>
while following the path, it led to the<br/>
door of a house, which was placed in<br/>
a high wall that we could not get<br/>
around. As I opened the door to go <br/>
through, I saw the room was filled <br/>
with large serpents. I entered, and <br/>
they all coiled up to jump at me; as <br/>
they made a spring to bite me, they<br/>
all fell dead at my feet, turned black, <br/>
swelled up, burst open, took fire, and <br/>
were consumed before my eyes.</p>

<br/>
<p>We met with much opposition from <br/>
Mr. Akeman, and many in the neigh-<br/>
borhood. Elder Brown wished to <br/>
leave the place immediately. I told <br/>
him I should stay, and see my dream<br/>
fulfilled. We staid in the neighbor-<br/>
hood twenty-five days, during which<br/>
time the Lord brought judgment upon<br/>
those who threatened to mob and kill <br/>
us; many of them died suddenly, and<br/>
I was warned three times by the Lord, <br/>
to go to Mr. Akeman, and bear testi-<br/>
mony unto him of the truth of ""Mor-<br/>
monism,"" and the wickedness of his <br/>
course in opposing it; and the last <br/>
time I called upon him, he was filled <br/>
with wrath against me, and when I <br/>
left his house, he followed me in a<br/>
rage, apparently with some evil intent.</p>

<br/>
<p>This singular dispensation of Provi-<br/>
dence brought solemnity upon the <br/>
people, and they began to reflect and <br/>
wished to hear preaching. We held<br/>
several meetings and preached, and<br/>
baptized Mr. [[Jonathan Hubbel|Hubbel]] and his [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|wife]], <br/>
who had opened their doors and given <br/>
us a home; and just as we had got <br/>
the people prepared to receive the<br/>
Gospel and anxious to learn, and plead-<br/>
ing with us to stay and preach, bro-<br/>
Brown resolved that he would con-<br/>
tinue his journey south. I was fully <br/>
satisfied that should we stop, we <br/>
would built up a Church, and was<br/>
convinced it was our duty to stop; <br/>
but brother Brown held the office of<br/>
an Elder, and I submitted.</p>

and help him; he had been long at <br/>

<p>HISTORY<br/>
OF<br/>
WILFORD WOODRUFF.<br/>
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-</p>

<br/>
<p>I followed Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglas]] to his own<br/>
[[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|island]], and commenced preaching to<br/>
his church, and baptized a good share <br/>
of his members, among whom were<br/>
several sea captains. Ministers from <br/>
the main land were sent for, who<br/>
came over and tried to put a stop to<br/>
the work, by preaching and lying<br/>
about us; but the work continued to <br/>
roll on. They wished me to work a<br/>
miracle to convince them that my doc-<br/>
trine was true. I told them they had <br/>
rejected the truth, and they would <br/>
see signs, but not unto salvation.</p>

<br/>
<p>[[Vinalhaven, Waldo County, Maine|Vinal Haven]], which includes both <br/>
[[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|north]] and south Fox Island, is in lat.<br/>
44°, long. 69°10'. The inhabitants <br/>
are generally healthy and industrious, <br/>
and hospitable to strangers, the people <br/>
obtain most of their wealth by fishing, <br/>
and fit out annually over one hundred <br/>
licensed vessels, beside many smaller <br/>
crafts. The north island is nine miles<br/>
long and two wide; population 800, <br/>
and contains a post office, a store, <br/>
a grist mill, four school houses, and a <br/>
Baptist church. The land is rocky <br/>
and rough, yet there are farms which <br/>
produce good wheat, barley, oats, <br/>
potatoes and grass; the principal<br/>
timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and <br/>
birch. The rasp and gooseberry grow<br/>
in great abundance. Sheep are the<br/>
principal stock.</p>

<br/>
<p>South Fox island is about ten miles<br/>
long and five wide, and is a mass of<br/>
rocks, principally granite, formed into <br/>
shelves, hills, hollows, and cut up into <br/>
nooks, points and ravines by coves<br/>
and harbors; population 1000. There<br/>
are some small patches under cultiva-<br/>
tion, at the expense of great labor and <br/>
toil. Many resident fishermen fish at <br/>
[[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and bring them home, <br/>
and dry them upon flakes; they annu-<br/>
ally supply the market with a great<br/>
amount of codfish, mackerel and <br/>
boxed herring. The latter island <br/>
contains two stores, three tide saw <br/>
mills, six school houses, a small branch</p>

acts in the ministry, and under this <br/>
view I have written sketches of most<br/>
of the sermons and teachings which I <br/>
have heard from the mouth of Joseph <br/>
Smith the Prophet, and many of the <br/>
teachings of the Twelve Apostles and <br/>
others. Believing this course to be <br/>
beneficial, I would recommend the<br/>

<p>CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.</p>

<p>(Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], Feb. 1858.)</p>

<br/>
<p>Varied and diverse are the lives <br/>
and fortunes of men; while the paths <br/>
of some are strewn with flowers and <br/>
ease from the cradle to the grave, <br/>
with naught to disturb their peace, <br/>
others are marked victims of varied<br/>
misfortunes, accidents and dangers. <br/>
The last-named class is the one in <br/>
whose ranks I have stood through my<br/>
infancy, childhood, youth and man-<br/>
hood, up to the present time, so much <br/>
so, that it has seemed as though some<br/>
invisible power or fate was watching<br/>
my footsteps, in order to find some<br/>
opportunity to take my life from the<br/>
earth. I can only attribute the con-<br/>
tinuation of my life to the present<br/>
time to a merciful God, whose hand <br/>
has been stretched out, and rescued<br/>
me from death in the midst of the <br/>
many dangers and hairbreadth escapes <br/>
I have passed through, some of which <br/>
I will here mention.</p>

<br/>
<p>When three years of age, I fell into<br/>
a caldron of boiling water, was in-<br/>
stantly caught out, but was so badly <br/>
scalded, that it was nine months be-<br/>
fore I was considered out of danger.</p>

<br/>
<p>At five years of age, I fell from the <br/>
great beam of a barn, striking my face <br/>
upon the floor, which came near <br/>
breaking my neck.</p>

<br/>
<p>Three months afterwards, I broke <br/>
one of my arms, by falling down<br/>
stairs. I soon after broke my other<br/>
arm, by falling out of a high stoop <br/>
upon a pile of timber.</p>

<br/>
<p>When six years of age, I came near<br/>
being killed by a surly bull. My <br/>
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and I were feeding pumpkins<br/>
to the cattle, a surly bull drove my <br/>
cow away from the one she was eating. <br/>
I took the pumpkin he had left, upon <br/>
which he pitched at me. My father <br/>
told me to throw down the pumpkin<br/>
and run. I ran down a steep hill, <br/>
and took the pumpkin with me, being <br/>
determined that the cow should have<br/>
her rights. The bull pursued. As <br/>
he was about to overtake me, I step-<br/>
ped into a post hole and fell; the bull <br/>
leaped over me, after the pumpkin, <br/>
and tore it to pieces with his horns,</p>

way, had I not fallen.</p>

<br/>
<p>During the same year, I went into<br/>
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] saw mill, with several <br/>
others. I got upon the head-block to<br/>
take a ride, while the carriage was<br/>
running back, not anticipating any <br/>
danger; my leg was caught between <br/>
the head-block and the fender-post, <br/>
and broke both bones of my leg below<br/>
the knee. I was taken to the house, <br/>
and lay nine hours before my bones <br/>
were set, suffering severe pain; but <br/>
being young, my bones soon knit <br/>
together, and I was upon my feet <br/>
again. During my confinement by <br/>
this lameness, my brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]]<br/>
was also confined in the same room<br/>
with the typhus fever.</p>

<br/>
<p>When seven years of age, I was <br/>
riding on the top of a load of hay, <br/>
which my uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozan Woodruff]], was<br/>
driving to the barn; he turned the <br/>
load over upon me; I was nearly<br/>
suffocated for the want of air, before <br/>
the hay was removed.</p>

<br/>
<p>At eight years old, I was riding in<br/>
a one-horse wagon with several others,<br/>
the horse took fright, ran down a<br/>
steep hill, and turned the wagon over<br/>
upon us; but again, while in the <br/>
midst of danger, my life was preserved;<br/>
none of us were seriously injured.</p>

<br/>
<p>When nine years old, I climbed into <br/>
an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped<br/>
upon a dry limb, which broke, and I <br/>
fell about fifteen feet upon my back, <br/>
which beat the breath out of my body. <br/>
A cousin ran and told my parents I <br/>
was dead. Before they arrived at the <br/>
spot, I came to my senses, and met<br/>
them.</p>

<br/>
<p>When twelve years of age, I was <br/>
drowned in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]], and<br/>
sunk in 30 feet of water, and after <br/>
carrying one person to the bottom <br/>
with me, I was miraculously saved by <br/>
a young man named [[John Bacon|Bacon]] diving to<br/>
the bottom, and carrying with him a <br/>
large stone, to hold him down until he<br/>
obtained my body, not expecting to <br/>
save me alive. I suffered much in <br/>
being restored to life.</p>

<p>HISTORY<br/>
OF<br/>
WILFORD WOODRUFF.<br/>
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-</p>

<br/>
<p>CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.<br/>
(Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], Feb. 1858.)</p>

<br/>
<p>At thirteen years of age, while <br/>
passing through [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] meadows,<br/>
in the depth of winter, the roads were<br/>
drifted with snow; and in an ex-<br/>
ceedingly blustering day, I became so <br/>
chilled and overcome with cold, that<br/>
I could not travel. I crawled into<br/>
the hollow of a large apple tree. A<br/>
man in the distance seeing me go in, <br/>
hastened to my rescue, realizing my<br/>
danger more fully than I did. When<br/>
he arrived at the spot, I had fallen<br/>
asleep, and was nearly insensible; he<br/>
had much difficulty in arousing me to<br/>
a sense of my situation. He procured<br/>
means to carry me to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]]<br/>
house, and through a kind Providence,<br/>
my life was again preserved.</p>

<br/>
<p>At fourteen years of age, I split my <br/>
left instep open with an ax, which <br/>
went nearly through my foot; it was <br/>
nine months getting well.</p>

<br/>
<p>At fifteen years of age, I was bitten<br/>
in my left hand by a mad dog in the<br/>
last stage of hydrophobia. He dented <br/>
my hand with his teeth, but did not<br/>
draw blood, and I was again pre-<br/>
served, through the mercies of God, <br/>
from an awful death.</p>

<br/>
<p>At the age of seventeen, I was riding <br/>
a very ill-tempered horse that I was <br/>
not acquainted with; and while going <br/>
down a very steep rocky hill, the <br/>
horse taking advantage of the ground, <br/>
suddenly leaped from the road, and<br/>
ran down the steep, amid the rocks, <br/>
at full speed, and commenced kicking <br/>
up, and attempted to throw me over<br/>
his head upon the rocks; but I lodged <br/>
upon the top of his head, grasped<br/>
hold of each ear as with a death grip, <br/>
expecting every moment to be dashed <br/>
to pieces against the rocks. While in<br/>
this position, sitting astride of his <br/>
neck, with no bridle to guide him but<br/>
his ears, he plunged down the hill <br/>
under full speed, until he ran against<br/>
a rock, and was dashed to the ground.</p>

263.0,37,,""">July 23, 1842</time>—President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph <br/>
Smith]] sent me from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St.]]</p>

",
263.0,38,,""">Sept. 12, 1843</time>—At five o'clock <br/>
p.m., I left [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on the express<br/>
train for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]. While passing<br/>
through [[Chesterwoods, Maine|Chesterwoods]], six miles south<br/>
of [[Kennebunk, York County, Maine|Kennebunk]], after dark, and while <br/>
going at full speed, we struck one of<br/>
the rails which some persons had<br/>
raised by rolling a log under it, and <br/>
landed in a pile; three cars were<br/>
filled with passengers, and their lives<br/>
were saved by having a long train of<br/>
freight between the passenger cars and<br/>
the engine; all of them were mashed<br/>
to pieces; the engineer was killed,<br/>
some of the passengers had bones <br/>
broken; I escaped unhurt.</p>

",
263.0,39,,""">5th of October, 1846</time>, while<br/>
with the camp of Israel building up <br/>
[[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|winter Quarters]], on the west side of <br/>
the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri river]], (then Indian <br/>
country) I passed through one of the<br/>
most painful and serious misfortunes<br/>
of my life. I took my axe and went<br/>
two and a half miles on to the bluffs to<br/>
cut some shingle timber to cover my <br/>
cabin; I was accompanied by two men. <br/>
While the third tree was falling, which <br/>
was an oak, over two feet in diameter,<br/>
I stepped behind it some ten feet, and<br/>
also to one side the same distance, <br/>
where I thought I would be entirely <br/>
out of danger; but when the tree fell,<br/>
there being a crook in the body of it,<br/>
which struck a knoll on the ground, <br/>
the whole body shot endways back of <br/>
the stump and bounded, and the butt<br/>
of the tree struck me on the breast<br/>
and knocked me several feet into the<br/>
air against a standing oak, and the <br/>
falling tree followed me in its bound<br/>
and caught me against the standing<br/>
tree, and I came down between them;<br/>
before reaching the earth, however, <br/>
I was liberated from them, and struck <br/>
the ground upon my feet in a badly<br/>
bruised condition. My left thigh, the <br/>
whole length of it, and my hip and<br/>
left arm were much bruised; my <br/>
breast bone and three ribs on my left <br/>
side were broken; my lungs, vitals and <br/>
left side were also bruised in a <br/>
shocking manner. After the accident<br/>
I sat upon a log until Mr. [[John Garrison|John<br/>
Garrison]] went a quarter of a mile to<br/>
get my horse. Notwithstanding I was <br/>
so badly hurt, I mounted my horse, <br/>
and rode two and a half miles over a <br/>
very rough road, dismounting twice in <br/>
consequence of miry places, my breast<br/>
and vitals were so badly torn to pieces, <br/>
that at each step of the horse the pain<br/>
went through me like an arrow. I con-<br/>
tinued on horseback until I arrived at <br/>
[[Turkey Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turkey creek]], on the north side of <br/>
Winter Quarters. I then became<br/>
exhausted, and was taken off my horse</p>

",
263.0,40,,""">29th</time> was another trying day to my<br/>
life; the poison had so thoroughly <br/>
penetrated my whole system, that my <br/>
strength left me; I could not stand, I <br/>
was led to my bed, my bowels and <br/>
stomach ceased to act, my speech was <br/>
like that of a drunken man. President<br/>
Young called, in company with [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Dr. <br/>
Sprague]], and [[laying on of hands|laid hands]] upon me, and<br/>
rebuked the disease and the power of<br/>
the destroyer which had seized my <br/>
body, and promised me in the name of<br/>
the Lord, that I should not die but live <br/>
to finish my work which was appointed<br/>
me upon the earth. I soon began to re-<br/>
cover. The poison and mortification left <br/>
my system and centered in my arm, and <br/>
was drawn from my arm through the aid<br/>
of charcoal poultices, moistened with <br/>
a strong decoction of wormwood, <br/>
ragweed and wild sage; the dead flesh<br/>
was removed from my arm with<br/>
instruments and lunar caustic, and in<br/>
a few days I was well again.</p>

<br/>
<p>I have occupied considerable space <br/>
in referring to those peculiar circum-<br/>
stances which have attended me <br/>
during life, and to sum the matter up<br/>
it stands thus:—I have broken both <br/>
legs—one in two places—both arms, <br/>
my breast bone and three ribs, and <br/>
had both ankles dislocated. I have <br/>
been drowned, frozen, scalded and bit<br/>
by a mad dog—have been in two water <br/>
wheels under full head of water—have <br/>
passed through several severe fits of <br/>
sickness, and encountered poison in its <br/>
worst forms—have landed in a pile of <br/>
railroad ruins—have barely been<br/>
missed by the passing bullets, and<br/>
have passed through a score of other <br/>
hair-breadth escapes.</p>

<br/>
<p>It has appeared miraculous to me, <br/>
that with all the injuries and broken<br/>
bones which I have had, I have not a<br/>
lame limb, but have been enabled to<br/>
endure the hardest labor, exposures <br/>
and journeys—have often walked forty, <br/>
fifty, and on one occasion, sixty miles<br/>
in a day. The protection and mercy <br/>
of God has been over me, and my life<br/>
thus far has been preserved; for which <br/>
blessings I feel to render the gratitude<br/>
of my heart to my [[Heavenly Father|Heavenly Father]], <br/>
praying that the remainder of my days<br/>
may be spent in His service and in the <br/>
building up of his kingdom.</p>

naught to disturb their peace others apparently are marked victims of variated<br/>
misfortune accidents &amp; dangers. The last named class is the one in whose ranks<br/>
I have stood through my infancy childhood youth &amp; manhood up to the present<br/>
time so much so that it has seemed as though some invisible power or fate was</p>",
370.0,3,,"<p>watching my footsteps in order to find some opportunity to take my life from<br/>
the Earth <s>but</s> I can ownly attribute the continuation of my life on Earth<br/>
to the present time to a merciful God whose hand has been streched out &amp; rescued<br/>
me from death in the midst of the many dangers and hair breadths escapes which I <br/>
have passed through <s>in life</s> some of which I will here mention</p>

<p>When three years of age I fell into a caldron of boiling water was instantly caught out<br/>
&amp; so badly scalded that is was 9 months before I was considered out of danger. When<br/>
five years of age I fell from the great beam of a barn upon my face upon the <s>beam</s> floor<br/>
which came near breaking my neck three months afterwards I broke one of my<br/>
arms falling down a pair of stairs.  I soon broke the other arm falling out of <br/>
a high stoop across some timber. When six years of age I came near being killed<br/>
by a surly bull and was ownly saved as it were by a miracle. During the same year<br/>
I went into my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] saw mill with several other children I got upon the head block<br/>
to take a ride while running the carriage back not anticipating any danger but before<br/>
I was aware of it my leg was caught between the head block &amp; fender post &amp; broak<br/>
both bones in two below the knee I was taken to the house &amp; lay 9 hours before my<br/>
bones was set which time was spent amid severe pain: but being young my bones<br/>
soon nit together &amp; in few weeks I was again upon my feet <s>attending to the sports of</s><br/>
<s>my youth</s>. During my confinement with this lameness my brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] was my<br/>
companion in the same room going through with a course of the typus fever<br/>
When 7 years of age I was riding on the top of a load of hay which my Uncle<br/>
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]] was driving to the barn when he turned the load over on top of <br/>
me and <s>before it was</s> I was nearly strangled for the want of air before it was removed<br/>
<s>from me</s>. While 8 years of age I was riding in a one horse waggon with <br/>
several others <s>to go to our labor</s> the horse took fright ran down a steep hill and <br/>
turned us over with the waggon on top of us. But again while in the midst of danger<br/>
my life was preserved none of us was seriously injured. While 9 years of age I <s>clumb</s> ^climbed^<br/>
into an Elim tree to obtain some bark. I steped upon a dry <s>tree</s> limb and I fell<br/>
about 15 feet upon my back which <s>apparently</s> beat the breath out of my body a cousin<br/>
ran &amp; told my parents I was dead, before they arrived at the spot I came to my senses<br/>
<s>arose upon my feet</s> &amp; met my Parents coming to me. At 12 years of age I<br/>
was drowned in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington River]] &amp; sunk in 30 feet of water and was miraculously<br/>
saved by a young man named Bacon, I suffered much in being restored to life<br/>

370.0,4,,"<p>Became so chilled &amp; overcome with cold I could not travel, I crawled into the<br/>

arousing me to a sens of my situation. He procured means to convey me to my<br/>
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] house and through a kind profidence my life was again preserved</p>

<p>At 14 years of age I split my left instep open with an ax which went nearly <br/>
through my foot &amp; ^it^ was 9 months getting well. At 15 years of age I was bitten in <br/>
my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of the Hydrophobia. He ownly clamped<br/>
my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood and I was preserved through<br/>
the mercy of God from an awful death. At the age of 17 I met with an accident<br/>
which caused me much suffering &amp; came near ending my life. I was riding a very<br/>
ill tempered horse which I was not acquainted with, and while going down a very steep<br/>
rocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground suddenly leaped from the road &amp; ran<br/>
down the steepest part of the hill amid the thicket &amp; the rocks at full speed and he commenced<br/>
kicking up at the same time &amp; about landing me over his head among the rocks but I lodged<br/>
on the top of his head grasped one hand hold of each ear as with a death grasp expecting evry<br/>

&amp; the rock about one rod &amp; struck the ground square upon my being the ownly thing<br/>
visible that saved my life, for had ^I^ struck upon any othe part of my body it must have <br/>
killed me instantly, as it was my <s>boenes</s> bones crushed from under me as though they<br/>
were reeds. It broke my left leg twice in two &amp; put out both of my ancles in a <br/>
shocking manner, and the horse came nigh rolling over me in his struggles to<br/>
get up. ^My uncle [[Titus Woodruff|Titus Woodruff]] saw^ <s>An uncle of mine saw</s> me fall, <s>hastened to my relief</s> got amist me &amp;<br/>
&amp; carried me to his house <s>in an arm chair</s>, I lay from 2 oclok till 10 at night<br/>

who set my bones boxed up my limbs &amp; carried me in his carriage 8 miles that <br/>
night to my Fathers <s>house</s> my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention<br/>
&amp; in 8 weeks I was outdoors upon my cruches <s>&amp; soon was all well again</s><br/>
In 1827 while <s>attending the Flouring Mill</s> attempting to clear the ice out of a water<br/>
wheel standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft a man hoisted the gate<br/>
let a full head of water upon it as soon as the water struck it it stopped my feet<br/>
sliped into [word covered] I immediately plunged head fore most over the rim of the </p>",
370.0,5,,"<p>wheel into about 3 feet of water and my weight drew my legs<br/>
out of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft &amp; crushed <br/>
to death. In 1831, while having charge of the Flouring Mill in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collins<s>v</s>-<br/>
ville]] Ct I was standing inside of a breast wheel 20 feet in diameter<br/>
upon one of the arms near the top clearing out the ice when a full head of <br/>
water was let onto it it immediately started. I dropped my ax and leaped<br/>
through the wheel to the bottom of it by the shaft &amp; arms about 20 feet as I struck<br/>
the bottom of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone well with ownly <br/>
about 2 feet clearance between it &amp; the wheel the wheel caught me &amp; rolled ^me^ out<br/>
into the water below where I found myself without any broken bones but with<br/>
some bruises &amp; much fright. ^*see paper apart^ In 1833 the day I was baptized into the<br/>
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints one of my horses newly calked<br/>
kicked my hat of my head &amp; had he struck 2 inches lower would probably <br/>
have killed me instantly. In 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same horses<br/>
down a hill on a sled without any box the bottom boards sliped forward<br/>
under the roll caught the ground turned endways fell on the horses badly<br/>
throwing me between the horses they ran to the bottom of the hill draging me<br/>
by the lines head foremost with the steed top of me about rods over<br/>
a smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangers<br/>
In 1834, while travelling in [[Zion|Zions Camp]] to [[Missouri|Missouri]] a rifle was accidentally<br/>
discharged &amp; the ball passed through three tents with a dozen men in each &amp; lodged<br/>
in a waggon axletree with a man standing against it it injured no one. It passed within<br/>
a few inches of my breast &amp; many others escaped as narrowly as my self</p>

<p>A few months afterwards a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing at<br/>
my breast within a few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot but it missed fire<br/>
and my life was again preserved.  In April 1839 in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] Ill I was riding<br/>
upon the running gears of a waggon without any box, I was sitting upon the fore ward<br/>
axletree and the bolt came out fastening the cupling pole this left the hind wheels &amp; my<br/>
weight on the forward bolster &amp; tongue turned the coupling pole clear over onto the horses<br/>
backs, turned the stakes upside down &amp; shut me up fast between the boulster &amp; tongue<br/>
but in such a manner that my head &amp; shoulders dragged on the ground my horses<br/>
took fright and ran out into an open <s>pari</s> prairie &amp; thus draged me in this position<br/>
for about half a mile when I managed <s>so as</s> to guide them with my left hand so <br/>
as to to run them into a corner of a high worm fence where we landed in a pile<br/>

not believe a word of it to be true ownly as they were done away through the unbeliefs<br/>
of the children of men I believed the same gifts graces miracles &amp; power would be <br/>
manifest the same in one age of the world as in another when God did have a Church <br/>

I find it difficult to obtain a satis-<br/>

for more than three generations.</p>

<br/>
<p>My great grandfather, [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Wood-<br/>

and possessed an iron constitution,<br/>
and performed a great amount of <br/>
manual labor nearly up to the time of<br/>
his death. His wife's name was [[Sarah Woodford Woodruff|Sarah]];<br/>

was the third son of Josiah. He was<br/>
born in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Hartford co.,<br/>
Connecticut, in 1751; he also posses-<br/>
sed a strong constitution. It was <br/>
said that he performed the most labor<br/>
for several years of any man in Hart-<br/>
ford county, and from over exertion <br/>
in hewing timber, he was attacked<br/>
with rheumatism in his right hip,<br/>
which caused severe lameness for<br/>
several years before his death. He<br/>
married [[Dinah Woodford Woodruff|Dinah Woodford]], by whom he <br/>
had seven children--viz., [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1773|Eldad]], [[Elizabeth Woodruff Frisbie|Eli-<br/>
zabeth]], [[Samuel G. Woodruff|Samuel]], [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek]], [[Titus Woodruff|Titus]], [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Helen]]<br/>
and [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]].</p>

was born in 1782, Nov. 29, 1801.<br/>

leaving me fifteen months old. My<br/>
father's second wife, Azubah Hart, <br/>

married Nov. 9, 1810; they had six<br/>
children--viz., [[Philo Woodruff|Philo]], born Nov. 29,<br/>

married her to [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]], in <br/>
Farmington, Conn., Aug. 4, 1841.<br/>

tioned man, and has done a great <br/>
amount of labor. At eighteen years <br/>
of age he commenced attending a flour-",

50 years; most of this time he labored<br/>
eighteen hours a day.</p>

<br/>
<p>He never made any profession of<br/>
religion until I baptized him, with all<br/>
his household, into the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of <br/>
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], on <br/>
the first day of July 1838. He was a <br/>
man of great charity, honesty, inte-<br/>
grity and truth, and made himself poor<br/>
by giving to the poor, and accomoda-<br/>
ting his fellow-men by loaning money<br/>
and becoming surety for his neighbors,<br/>
and always saying yes to every man<br/>
who asked a favor at his hand.</p>

<br/>
<p>I was born in the north part of the <br/>
town of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], <br/>
Hartford co., Conn., March 1, 1807.<br/>
I assisted my father in attending the <br/>
Farmington Mills, until I was twenty<br/>
years of age.</p>

<br/>
<p>In April 1827, I took the flouring <br/>
mill of my aunt, [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Helen Wheeler]], <br/>
which I attended three years. In <br/>
May 1830, I took charge of the flour-<br/>
ing mill of Mr. [[Samuel Collins|Colllins]], the ax manu-<br/>
facturer, in [[South Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|South Canton]], Conn. At<br/>
the end of one year it was demolished<br/>
to make way for other machinery. <br/>
In March 1831, I took charge of the <br/>
flouring mill owned by Mr. [[Richard B. Cowles|Richard <br/>
B. Cowles]] of [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]], Conn. <br/>
In the spirng of 1832, in company <br/>
with my oldeset brother, [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], I <br/>
went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego co., New<br/>

 <br/>
<p>My father<strike>,</strike> <strike>Aphek</strike> was a strong constitutioned man, and<br/>
has done a great amount of labor. At 18 years of age, he commenced<br/>
attending a flouring and saw mill, and continued about [page covered]<br/>

<br/>
<p>He never made any profession of religion, until [page covered]<br/>
him with all his household into the church of Jesus [page covered]<br/>
Latter day Saints on the first day of July 1838. He [page covered]<br/>
man of great charity, honesty, integrity and truth, and made himself<br/>
poor by giving to the poor and accommodating his fellow-men<br/>
by loaning money and becoming surety for his neighbors, and <br/>
always saying yes to every man who asked a favor at his hand</p>

<br/>
<p>I was born in the North part of the town of<br/>
Farmington, now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], Hartford Co., Conn. March 1, 1807.<br/>
I assisted my Father in attending the Farmington Mills, until I<br/>
was 20 years of age. / In <strike>the Spring of</strike> ^April,^ 1827 I took the flouring<br/>
mill of my Aunt, [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen Wheeler]], which I attended three years.<br/>
In <strike>the Spring of </strike> ^May,^ 1830, I took charge of the flouring mill of Mr.<br/>
[[Samuel Collins|Collins]], the ax manufacturer, in [[South Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|south Canton]], Conn., at the end <br/>
of one year it was demolished to make way for other machinery.<br/>
In <strike>the spring</strike> <s>of</s> ^March,^ 1831 I took charge of the flouring mill owned<br/>
by Mr. [[Richard B. Cowles|Richd. B. Cowle<s>y</s>s]] of [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]], Conn. In <strike>the Sp^r^ing</strike> ^stet^<br/>
<s>of</s> ^stet^ 1832, in company with my oldest brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], I went to<br/>
[[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Owego Co., New York, and purchased a farm and saw mill,<br/>
and settled <strike>down</strike> in business <strike>for ourselves</strike>.</p>

<br/>
<p>At an early age my mind was exercised upon religious</p>

",
374.0,3,,"<p></p><p>subjects, although I never made a<strike>n</strike> ^<strike>outward</strike>^ profession until 1830; I did <br/>
not then join any church, for the reason that I could not find <br/>
any denomination whose doctrines, faith or practice, agreed with <br/>
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordinances and gifts which the <br/>
Apostles taught.  Although the ministers of the day taught that <br/>
the faith, gifts, graces, miracles ^&amp; ordinances,^ which the ancient saints enjoyed <br/>
were done away and no longer needed, I did not believe <strike>a word of</strike><br/>
it<s>,</s> to be true, only as they were done away through the unbelief of<br/>
the children of men; I believed the same gifts, graces, miracles and <br/>
power would be manifest in one age of the world as in another,<br/>
when God had a church upon the earth, &amp; <strike>I believed</strike> ^that^ the church <br/>
of God would be ^re-^established upon the earth, <strike>in my</strike> and that <br/>
I should live to see it.  Th<s>i</s>es^e^ principles w<s>as</s>^ere^ rivetted upon my <br/>
mind from <strike>two causes; first, from</strike> the perusal of the old and <br/>
new Testament, with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me <br/>
what was right and wrong, and lead me in the path of salva-<br/>
tion, without any regard to the opinions of man, and the <br/>
whisperings of the spirit of the Lord for the space of three years <br/>
taught me <strike>in accordance with the written word of God</strike> that <br/>
He was about to set up His church and kingdom upon the <br/>
earth in the last days. / <strike>and secondly,</strike> I was taught th<s>i</s>es^e^ <br/>
<strike>principle</strike> ^things^ from my youth by [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], an aged man,<br/>
who lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]], Conn.; who was frequently called the old <br/>
prophet Mason,: he taught me many things which are now<br/>
coming to pass. <s>/ he</s></p>

<br/>
<p>He did not believe that any <strike>person</strike> man <strike>upon the</strike><br/>
<strike>face of the earth</strike> had authority to administer in the ordinances<br/>
of the Gospel, but believed it was our privilege through faith, prayer <br/>
and fasting to heal the sick, and cast out Devils by the laying on <br/>
of hands, which was the case under his administration as many <br/>
could testify.</p>

<br/>
<p><strike>I was looking for the coming forth of the truth when I</strike><br/>
<strike>heard of what was called Mormonism</strike>.  In 1832 I was <br/>
inspired to go to [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]], <strike>an</strike> my brother, [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]], was<br/>
also directed by the spirit of God to go to the same place</p>

",
374.0,4,,"<p></p><p>when [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|we]] met, we both told our impressions, and it caused us <br/>
to <strike>wonder and</strike> marvel and wonder, what the Lord wanted of <br/>
us in [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]; but as we had made preparations <br/>
to move to the West, we let outward circumstances control us,<br/>
and Jonah-like, instead of going to Rhode Island, we went <br/>
to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego Co., New York, and there remained until <br/>
<strike>the</strike> <s>29th day of</s> Dec., ^29,^ 1833, <strike>before</strike> ^when^ I heard Elder [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsiper]] <br/>
and [[Elijah Cheney|Elijah Cheeny]] preach. My brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] and I believed <br/>
their testimony, <strike>and</strike> <s>invited</s> ^entertained^ the Elders <strike>home</strike> and offered our-<br/>
selves for baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the <br/>
book of Mormon and I received a testimony that it was <br/>
true.</p>

<br/>
<p><strike>I learned that Elders [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Sam. H. Smith]] and [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]</strike> <s>were</s><br/>
<s>had preached in Rhode island in 1832, which accounted for the</s><br/>
<s>reason</s> We soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode <br/>
Island, for at the time we were warned <strike>of the Lord</strike> to go there, <br/>
two of the Elders <s>of the Latter day Saints</s> were preaching there,<br/>
and had we gone, we <strike>certainly</strike> should have embraced the <br/>
work at that time, <strike>but</strike> <s>as it was</s> <s>we had to wait for</s><br/>
<s>the next call</s>.</p>

<br/>
<p>Dec. 31, I was baptized by Elder Zerah Pulsipher; <strike>and</strike> ^he^ <br/>
confirmed ^me^ the same evening.</p>

<br/>
<p>Jan. 2, 1834 I was ordained <strike>to the office of</strike> a Teacher,<br/>
and my <strike>Eldest</strike> brother, Azmon, an Elder, and a small branch organized <br/>
of 12 members by Elder Pulsipher.</p>

 <br/>
<p>In Feby. following, in company with Elder Holton, I walked <br/>
some 60 miles to the town of [[Fabius, Onondaga County, New York|Fabius]] to attend an evening meeting <br/>
of the saints in that place where Elder Pulsipher was presiding; I <br/>
saw the book of commandments or revelations given through [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], <br/>
and I believed them with all my heart and rejoiced therein, and after <br/>
spending several days <strike>with them</strike>, and holding several meetings, we returned <br/>
home rejoicing. ¶ During the winter, we were visited by several of the <br/>
Elders <strike>among whom was Elder [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]]</strike>; <s>He</s> <s>again</s> <s>who called</s><br/>

I felt impressed ^By the spirit of God^ to take a Mission to Fox<br/>

<p>I immediately <strike>went to work with all my might and</strike> settled<br/>
my business. ¶ April 11, 1834, <strike>I</strike> ^with my^ <strike>b<s>i</s>ad^e^ my friends farewell, and</strike> <strike>took a</strike> <strike>pair</strike><br/>

[[Warren Ingles|Warren Ing<strike>a</strike>les]], and started for <strike>Kirtland, Ohio</strike> ^Zion^. I met with [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]],<br/>
[[John Murdock|John Murdoch]] and other Elders on the way and arrived in Kirtland<br/>
on the 25<sup>th</sup> day of April 1834.</p>

<p><strike>I was introduced to</strike> The prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], <strike>who</strike> invited me<br/>
to make his house my home; <strike>which</strike> <strike>kind offer</strike> I accepted<strike>,</strike> ^his offer^ and staid<br/>
with him about one week. I became acquainted <strike>not only with the</strike><br/>
<strike>prophet Joseph, and his family but / with</strike> ^stet^ many of the High Priests<br/>
Elders and Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland and heard many<br/>
of the Elders speak, and I felt to rejoice before God for the light and<br/>
knowledge which was manifested to me during that day.</p>

<p>May 1, I started from Kirtland, and went to [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]],<br/>
and remained till all the company joined us, when we were organized.<br/>
^¶^ March 7, we took up our line of march, pitching our tents by the<br/>
way, and travelled to [[Missouri|Missouri]].</p>

<p>After we had pitched our tents in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay Co.]] (our number<strike>s</strike> being<br/>
205) and many of the brethren had been taken sick, and some had<br/>
died, Joseph requested the camp to disperse, except enough to take care<br/>
of the sick; all who had teams were required to leave the ground<br/>
go among the brethren, I went to bro. [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wights']], in company<br/>
with [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]] and [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. <strike>After</strike> Shortly, Joseph called<br/>
the brethren together at Lyman Wights', and told them if they would<br/>
humble themselves before the Lord, and covenant to keep His command-<br/>
ments and obey His counsel, the plague should be stayed from that<br/>
hour, and there should not be another case of the cholera in the<br/>
camp. The brethren <strike>commanded</strike> covenanted to do this and the<br/>
plague was stayed and there was not another case in camp.</p>

<p>Prest. Joseph Smith returned <strike>home</strike> ^to Kirtland^ with many <strike>other</strike> of the <br/>

alone, and called upon the Lord in earnest prayer to open my way<br/>

spirit of the Lord <strike>rested upon me and</strike> bore witness <strike>unto me</strike> <br/>

God or not we must follow the teaching of the revelations of<br/>
God unto us. St [[Epistle of James|James]] sayes ""if any man lack wisdom let<br/>
him ask of God who giveth liberally and upbraideth not and it <br/>
shall be given him"". [##James 1:5##] Again ask and you shall receive, <s>◊</s>◊ask<br/>
and it shall be given unto you. It was upon this promise<br/>
that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] went before the Lord and prayed in the name<br/>
of Jesus Christ and asked for knowledge wisdom &amp; understa-<br/>
nding in order to know what to do to ^be^ saved and he plead the<br/>
promise of St [[James (NT)|James]] before the Lord and the Lord opened the <br/>
heavens unto him, and the Father &amp; Son was revealed unto him<br/>
and the voice of the great <u>[[Elohim|Ellohem]]</u> unto him was this is my <br/>
Beloved Son hear ye Him this was the first revelation of God<br/>
to him and He did harken to the voice of Jesus Christ all his<br/>
life afterwards and received a code of revelations and the word of<br/>
the Lord unto him as long as He dwelt in the flesh and left as<br/>
strong a testament as ever given to the Human family &amp; sealed that<br/>
testament with his own life &amp; blood<s>,</s> and we all have to pursue<br/>
the same course in order to obtain revelations from God. But I wish <br/>
to impress this truth upon the [[rising generation|rising generation]] and all who read this<br/>
testimony that the Lord does not give revelation, or send angels to <br/>
men, or work miracles, to accomodate the notions of any man<br/>
who is seeking for a sign, when we have the principles of the Gospel<br/>
revealed to us through the mouth of the savior or by inspired<br/>
prophets or Apostles we have no need to ask the Lord to reveal them</p>

several lies, which I corrected before the people, which <br/>
increased his rage; as I was forbidden to preach in the <br/>

him if he would go about 3 miles and heal two of his small <br/>
children, who were twins, about 3 months old, and were sick nigh <br/>
unto death; he was a man of the world, he had never heard <br/>
a sermon preached by a latter-day Saint. Joseph said he could <br/>
not go, but he would send a man, after <strike>a momen</strike> hesitating <br/>

asked if there was any harm for him to have another<br/>

<p>That day was delivered by<br/>
Joseph to a large assembly of Saints a discourse<br/>
of which the following is a synopsis.</p>

<p><u>Sealing the Children to the Fathers</u></p>

<p>When I consider the surrounding circumstances<br/>
in which I am placed this day standing in the<br/>
open air with weak lungs and somewhat out of health<br/>
I feel that I must have the prayers and faith of my<br/>
brethren that God may strengthen me and pour out<br/>
his special blessings upon me if you get much<br/>
from me this day [FIGURE]</p>

<p>There are many people assembled<br/>
here and in this city from various parts of the world<br/>
who say that they have to a certainty received a portion<br/>
of Knowledge from God by revelation in the way<br/>
which He has ordained and pointed out. I shall<br/>
take the broad ground then that if we have or can</p>",
42658.0,9,,"<p>receive a portion of Knowledge from God by immediate revelation<br/>
by the same source we can receive all Knowledge</p>

<p>What shall I talk about to day? I know<br/>
what brother Cahoon wants <strike>about</strike> <strike>^me to the^</strike>. He wants me to speak<br/>
about the coming of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] in the Last days. I can see<br/>
it in his eye. I will speak upon that subject then</p>

<p>The Bible says I will send you Elijah<br/>
before the great and terrible day of the Lord come that he<br/>
shall turn the hearts of the <strike>children</strike> ^Fathers^ to the children and<br/>
the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and<br/>
smite the earth with a curse. Now the word ""turn""<br/>
here should be translated bind or seal.</p>

<p>But what is the object of this important<br/>
mission or how is it to be fulfilled. The Keys are to<br/>
be delivered the Spirit of Elijah is to come the Gospel<br/>
to be established the Saints of God gathered Zion built<br/>
up and the Saints to come up as Saviours on Mount<br/>
Zion. But how are they to become Saviours on <br/>
Mount Zion? By building their Temples creating <br/>
their baptismal fonts and going forth and receiving<br/>
all the ordinances baptisms confirmations washings<br/>
anointings ordinations and sealing powers upon our<br/>
heads in behalf of all our progenitors who are dead<br/>
and redeem them that they may come forth in the<br/>
first resurrection and be exalted to thrones of<br/>
glory with us</p>

<p>Herein is the chain which binds<br/>
the hearts of the Fathers to the children and to the children<br/>
to the Fathers which fulfills the mission of Elijah<br/>
I would to God that this Temple was now done<br/>
that we might go into it and go to work and<br/>
improve our time and make use of the seals while<br/>
they are on earth. The Saints have none too</p>",
42659.0,2,,""">March <br/>
1st, 1807</time>. I assisted my father in attend-</p>",
42658.0,10,,"<p>much time to save and redeem their dead and gather<br/>
together their living relatives that they may be saved<br/>
also before the earth will be smitten and the condemnation<br/>
decreed falls upon the world</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] would advise all the Saints to go<br/>
to with all their might and gather together all their living<br/>
relations to this place that they may be sealed and <br/>
saved that they may be prepared against the day when<br/>
the Destroying Angel goes forth.</p>

<p>If the whole Church should go to<br/>
with all their might to save their dead, seal their<br/>
posterity and gather their living friends and spend<br/>
none of their time in behalf of the world they<br/>
would hardly get through when Night would come<br/>
when no man could work</p>

<p>My only trouble at the present<br/>
time is concerning ourselves—that the Saints will<br/>
be divided and broken up and scattered before we<br/>
get our salvation secure; for their are so many fools<br/>
in the world for the Devil to operate upon it gives<br/>
him the advantage of ten times</p>

<p>The question is frequently asked<br/>
can we not be saved without going through with<br/>
all these ordinances? I would answer no; not<br/>
with the fulness of salvation</p>

<p>Jesus said there were many<br/>
mansions in his Father's Kingdom and he would<br/>
go and prepare a place for them. (""House"" in the<br/>
text should have been translated Kingdom). Any<br/>
person who is exalted to the highest mansion has to<br/>
abide a celestial law and the whole law too; but<br/>
here has been a great diffuculty in getting anything<br/>
into the hearts of this generation. It has been</p>",

Feb</time> I was conversing with [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] when<br/>
Joseph came in with W. W. Phelps and he related<br/>
to us the following dream</p>

<p>""I was standing on a peninsula in<br/>
the midst of a large body of water where there appeared<br/>
to be a large harbour or a pier built out for boats<br/>
to come into. I was surrounded by my friends <br/>
and while looking at this harbour I saw a Steam-<br/>
boat approaching it. There were bridges on the <br/>
pier for persons to cross and there came up a wind<br/>
and drove the Steam-boat under one of the bridges<br/>
and upset it.</p>

<p>I ran up to the boat expecting the<br/>
persons would all drown^ed^ and wishing to do something<br/>
to assist them. I put my hand to the side of the boat<br/>
and with one surge I pushed it under the bridge and it<br/>
righted it up and I told them to take care of themselves.</p>",
42658.0,13,,"<p>But it was not long before [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] saw them starting out into the<br/>
channel or main body of water again. The storms were<br/>
raging and the waters rough. I said to my friends that<br/>
if they did not understand the signs and the times and<br/>
the spirit of prophecy they would be apt to be lost. It was<br/>
but a few moments after when we saw the waves break<br/>
over the boat and she soon foundered and went down<br/>
with all on board and perished</p>

<p>The storm amd waters were still <br/>
very rough; yet I told my friends around me that<br/>
I believed I could stem those waves and storm and<br/>
swim in the waters better than the steam boat<br/>
did and that at any rate I was determined to try<br/>
it. But my freinds laughed at me and told <br/>
me that I could not stand the storm at all<br/>
but should be drowned.</p>

<p>The waters looked clear and <br/>
beautiful though exceedingly rough and I said that <br/>
I beleived I could swim and that I would try it<br/>
anyhow. They said I should drown. I answered<br/>
that I would have a frolic on the water first if  I <br/>
did and I <strike>drove</strike> ^dived^ off into the raging waves. I had<br/>
swam but a short distance when a towering wave<br/>
overwhelmed me for a time but I soon found myself<br/>
upon the top of it. I met the second wave in<br/>
the same way and for a while I struggled hard to <br/>
live in the midst of the storm and waves; but I <br/>
soon found that I gained upon every wave and stemmed<br/>
the torrent better and better. I soon had power<br/>
to swim with my head out of water so the waves<br/>
did not break over me at all and I found that I <br/>
swam a great distance. In looking about<br/>
me I saw my brother [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel]] by my side</p>",
42659.0,4,,""">24th of June, 1834</time>, and we pitched <br/>
our tents on the premises. He told some <br/>
of the brethren of my company that he <br/>
had a spare room that some of us might <br/>
occupy if we would clean it. Our com-<br/>
pany accepted the offer, and, fearing <br/>
that some other company would get it <br/>
first, left all other business and went to <br/>
work, cleaning out the room, and imme-<br/>
diately spread down our blankets, so as <br/>
to hold a right to the room. It was but <br/>
a short time afterwards that our brethren, <br/>
who were attacked by [[cholera|cholera]], were <br/>
brought in and laid upon our beds. <br/>
None of us ever used those blankets <br/>
again, for they were buried with the <br/>
dead. So we gained nothing but experi-<br/>
ence by being selfish, and we lost our <br/>
bedding.</p>

42658.0,14,,"<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] asked [[Samuel Harrison Smith|him]] how he liked it and he said first rate and <br/>
I thought so too. I was soon enabled to swim with <br/>
my head and shoulders out of water and I could swim<br/>
as fast as any steamboat. In a little time it <br/>
became calm and I could rush through the water only<br/>
going in up to my loins. Soon I only went in up<br/>
to my knees and finally I could tread upon the top <br/>
of the water and went almost with the speed of an arrow<br/>
I said to Samuel se[e] how swift I can go and thought <br/>
it was great pleasure to travel with such speed <br/>
and I awoke.""</p>

Living to day. That thousand miles journey with the <br/>

school of Experience that I shall never forget <br/>
in this world nor the world to come. <br/>

of his company, I rem^ain^ed in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], M<s>o</s>issouri,</p>",

[[Zion|Zion's Camp]] to [[Missouri|Missouri]], and we had <br/>
passed through all the trials of that jour-<br/>
ney, and had buried a number of our <br/>
brethren, as recorded in history, the <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] called the Camp together, and <br/>
organized the Church in Zion, and gave <br/>
much good counsel to all.</p>

<p>He advised all the young men, who <br/>
had no families, to stay in Missouri, and <br/>
not return to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. Not having any <br/>
family, I stopped with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], as <br/>
did [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]]. <br/>
We spent the summer together, laboring <br/>
hard, cutting wheat, quarrying rock, <br/>
making brick, or anything else we could <br/>
find to do.</p>

<p>In the Fall I had a desire to go and <br/>
preach the gospel. I knew the gospel <br/>
which the Lord had revealed to Joseph <br/>
Smith was true, and of such great value <br/>
that I wanted to tell it to the people <br/>
who had not heard it. It was so good <br/>
and plain, it seemed to me I could make <br/>
the people believe it.</p>

<p>I was but a Teacher, and it is not a <br/>
Teacher's office to go abroad and preach. <br/>
I dared not tell any of the authorities of <br/>
the Church that I wanted to preach, lest <br/>
they might think I was seeking for an <br/>
office.</p>

<p>I went to the woods where no one <br/>
could see me, and I prayed to the Lord <br/>
to open my way so that I could go and <br/>
preach the gospel. While I was praying, <br/>
the [[Spirit of the Lord|Spirit of the Lord]] came upon me, <br/>
and told me my prayer was heard and <br/>
that my request should be granted.</p>

<p>I felt very happy, and got up and <br/>
walked out of the woods into the trav-<br/>
eled road, and there I met a [[High Priest|high priest]] <br/>
who had lived in the same house with me <br/>
some six months.</p>

<p>He had not said a word to me about <br/>
preaching the gospel; but now, as soon <br/>
as I had met him, he said, ""the Lord <br/>
has revealed to me that it is your privi-<br/>
lege to be ordained, and to go and <br/>
preach the gospel.""</p>

<p>I told him I was willing to do what-<br/>
ever the Lord required of me. I did <br/>
tell him I had just asked the Lord to let <br/>
me go and preach.</p>

<p>In a few days a council was called at <br/>
Lyman Wight's, and I was ordained a <br/>
[[Priest|Priest]] and sent on a mission into [[Arkansas Territory|Ar-<br/>
kansas]] and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in company with <br/>
an [[Henry Brown|elder]]. This mission was given us by</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
Elder [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]], who was the <br/>
first [[Bishop|Bishop]] ordained in the Church.</p>

<p>The [[law of God|law of God]] to us in those days <br/>
was to go without purse or scrip. Our <br/>
journey lay through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], <br/>
from which the Saints had just been <br/>
driven, and it was dangerous for a Mor-<br/>
mon to be found in that part of the <br/>
State.</p>

<p>We put some [[Book of Mormon|Books of Mormon]] and <br/>
some clothing into our valises, strapped <br/>
them on our backs, and started on foot. <br/>
We crossed the ferry into Jackson <br/>
County, and went through it.</p>

<p>In some instances the Lord preserved <br/>
us, as it were by miracle, from the mob.</p>

<p>We dare not go to houses and get <br/>
food, so we picked and ate raw corn, <br/>
and slept on the ground, and did any <br/>
way we could until we got out of the <br/>
county.</p>

<p>We dared not preach while in that <br/>
county, and we did but little preaching <br/>
in the State of Missouri. The first time <br/>
I attempted to preach was on Sunday, in <br/>
a tavern, in the early part of December, <br/>
1834. It was snowing at the time and <br/>
the room was full of people. As I com-<br/>
menced to speak the landlord opened <br/>
the door, and the snow blew on the peo-<br/>
ple; and when I inquired the object of <br/>
having the door opened in a snow storm, <br/>
he informed me that he wanted some <br/>
light on the subject. I found that it was <br/>
the custom of the country.</p>

<p>How much good I did in that sermon <br/>
I never knew, and probably never shall <br/>
know until I meet that congregation in <br/>
judgment.</p>

<p>In the southern part of Missouri and <br/>
the northern part of Arkansas, in 1834, <br/>
there were but very few inhabitants.</p>

<p>We visited a place called [[Harmony Mission, Bates County, Missouri|Harmony <br/>
Mission]], on the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage River]], one of the <br/>
most crooked rivers in the west. This <br/>
mission was kept by a [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] min-<br/>
ister and his family.</p>

<p>We arrived there on Sunday night at <br/>
sunset. We had walked all day with <br/>
nothing to eat, and were very hungry <br/>
and tired. Neither the minister nor his <br/>
wife would give us anything to eat, nor <br/>
let us stay over night, because we were <br/>
Mormons, and the only chance we had <br/>
was to go twelve miles further down the <br/>
river, to an Osage Indian trading post, <br/>
kept by a Frenchman named [[Michel Geraud|Jereu]]. <br/>

give us a piece of bread, lied to us about <br/>
the road, and sent us across the swamp, <br/>
and we wallowed knee-deep in mud and <br/>
water till ten o'clock at night in trying <br/>
to follow this crooked [[Osage River, Missouri|river]]. We then <br/>
left the swamp, and put out into the <br/>
prairie, to lie in the grass for the night.</p>

<p>When we came out of the swamp, we <br/>
heard an Indian drumming on a tin pail <br/>
and singing. It was very dark, but we <br/>
traveled towards the noise, and when we <br/>
drew near the Indian camp quite a num-<br/>
ber of large Indian dogs came out to <br/>
meet us. They smelt us, but did not <br/>
bark nor bite.</p>

<p>We were soon surrounded by [[Osage People|Osage <br/>
Indians]], and kindly received by Mr. <br/>
[[Michel Geraud|Jereu]] and his wife, who was an Indian. <br/>
She gave us an excellent supper and a <br/>
good bed, which we were thankful for <br/>
after the fatigue of the day.</p>

<p>As I laid my head upon my pillow, I <br/>
felt to thank God from the bottom of <br/>
my heart, for the exchange of the bar-<br/>
barous treatment of a civilized Presby-<br/>
terian priest for the humane, kind and <br/>
generous treatment of the savage Osage <br/>
Indians.</p>

<p>May God reward them both according <br/>
to their deserts.</p>

<p>We arose in the morning, after a good <br/>
night's rest. I was somewhat lame, <br/>
from wading in the swamp the night <br/>
before. We had a good breakfast. Mr. <br/>
Jereu sent an Indian to see us across the <br/>
river, and informed us that it was sixty <br/>
miles to the nearest settlement of either <br/>
white or red men.</p>

<p>We were too bashful to ask for any-<br/>
thing to take with us to eat; so we <br/>
crossed the river and started on our <br/>
day's journey of sixty miles without a <br/>
morsel of food of any kind.</p>

<p>We started about sunrise and crossed <br/>
a thirty-mile prairie, apparently as level <br/>
as a house floor, without shrub or water. <br/>
We arrived at timber about two o'clock <br/>
in the afternoon. As we approached the <br/>
timber a large [[black bear|black bear]] came out <br/>
towards us. We were not afraid of him, <br/>
for we were on the Lord's business, and <br/>
had not mocked God's prophets as did <br/>
the forty-two wicked children who said <br/>
to [[Elisha (OT)|Elisha]] ""Go up thou bald head,"" for <br/>
which they were torn by bears.</p>

<p>When the bear got within eight rods <br/>
of us he sat on his haunches and looked <br/>
at us a moment, and then ran away;</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
and we went on our way rejoicing. We <br/>
had to travel in the night, which was <br/>
cloudy and very dark, so we had great <br/>
difficulty to keep the road. Soon a large <br/>
drove of wolves gathered around, and <br/>
followed us. They came very close, and <br/>
at times it seemed as though they would <br/>
eat us up.</p>

<p>We had materials for striking a light, <br/>
and at ten o'clock, not knowing where <br/>
we were, and the wolves becoming so <br/>
bold, we thought it wisdom to make a <br/>
fire; so we stopped and gathered a lot <br/>
of oak limbs that lay on the ground, and <br/>
lit them, and as our fire began to burn <br/>
the wolves left us.</p>

<p>As we were about to lay down on the <br/>
ground—for we had no blankets—we <br/>
heard a dog bark.</p>

<p>My companion said it was a wolf; I <br/>
said it was a dog: but soon we heard a <br/>
cow bell. Then we each took a fire-<br/>
brand and went about a quarter of a <br/>
mile, and found the house, which was <br/>
sixty miles from where we started that <br/>
morning.</p>

<p>It was an old log cabin, about twelve <br/>
feet square, with no door, but an old <br/>
blanket was hung up in the door-way. <br/>
There was no furniture except one bed-<br/>
stead, upon which lay a woman, several <br/>
children and several small dogs. A [[Mr. Williams|man]] <br/>
lay on the bare floor with his feet to the <br/>
fire-place, and all were asleep. I went <br/>
in and spoke to the man, but did not <br/>
wake him. I stepped to him, and laid <br/>
my hand on his shoulder. The moment <br/>
he felt the weight of my hand he jumped <br/>
to his feet, and ran around the room as <br/>
though he was frightened; but he was <br/>
quieted when we informed him we were <br/>
friends.</p>

<p>The cause of his fright was, he had <br/>
shot a panther a few nights before, and <br/>
he thought its mate had jumped upon <br/>
him.</p>

<p>He asked us what we wanted; we told <br/>
him we wished to stop with him all <br/>
night, and would like something to eat. <br/>
He informed us we might lay on the <br/>
floor as he did, but that he had not a <br/>
mouthful for us to eat, as he had to de-<br/>
pend on his gun to get breakfast for his <br/>
family in the morning. So we lay on <br/>
the bare floor, and slept through a long, <br/>
rainy night, which was pretty hard after <br/>
walking sixty miles without anything to </p>",

will serve!</p>

<p>We shall call upon this vast<br/>

eat. That was the hardest day's work <br/>
of my life.</p>

<p>The man's name was [[Mr. Williams|Williams]]. He <br/>
was in the mob in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]: and <br/>
after the Saints were driven out, he, with <br/>
many others, went south.</p>

<p>We got up in the morning and walked <br/>
in the rain twelve miles to the house of <br/>
a man named Bemon, who was also one <br/>
of the mob from Jackson County. They <br/>
were about sitting down to breakfast as <br/>
we came in.</p>

<p>In those days it was the custom of the <br/>
Missourians to ask you to eat even if <br/>
they intended to cut your throat as soon <br/>
as you got through; so he asked us to <br/>
take breakfast, and we were very glad of <br/>
the invitation.</p>

<p>He knew we were Mormons; and as <br/>
soon as we began to eat he began to <br/>
swear about the Mormons. He had a <br/>
large platter of bacon and eggs, and <br/>
plenty of bread on the table, and his <br/>
swearing did not hinder our eating, for <br/>
the harder he swore the harder we ate, <br/>
until we got our stomachs full; then we <br/>
arose from the table, took our hats, <br/>
thanked him for our breakfast, and the <br/>
last we heard of him he was still swear-<br/>
ing.</p>

<p>I trust the Lord will reward him for <br/>
our breakfast.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Church, it <br/>
was a great treat to an Elder in his travels <br/>
through the country to find a Mormon; <br/>
it was so with us. We were hardly in <br/>
[[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] when we heard of a family <br/>
named Akeman. They were in Jackson <br/>
County in the persecutions. Some of <br/>
the sons had been tied up there and <br/>
whipped on their bare backs with hickory <br/>
switches by the mob. We heard of their <br/>
living on [[Petit Jean River, Arkansas Territory|Petit Jean River]], in the Ar-<br/>
kansas Territory, and we went a long <br/>
way to visit them.</p>

<p>There had recently been heavy rains, <br/>
and a creek that we had to cross was <br/>
swollen to a rapid stream of eight rods <br/>
in width. There was no person living <br/>
nearer than two miles from the crossing, <br/>
and no boat. The people living at the <br/>
last house on the road, some three miles <br/>
from the crossing, said we would have to <br/>
tarry till the water fell before we could <br/>
cross. We did not stop, feeling to trust <br/>
in God.</p>

<p>Just as we arrived at the rolling flood <br/>
a [[Negro|negro]], on a powerful horse, entered</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
the stream on the opposite side and rode <br/>
through it. On our making our wants <br/>
known to him, he took us, one at a time, <br/>
behind him and carried us safely over, <br/>
and we went on our way rejoicing.</p>

<p>We arrived that night within five <br/>
miles of Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Akeman's]], and were kindly <br/>
entertained by a stranger. During the <br/>
night I had the following dream:</p>

<p>I thought an angel came to us, and <br/>
told us we were commanded of the Lord <br/>
to follow a certain straight path, which <br/>
was pointed out to us, let it lead us <br/>
wherever it might. After we had walked <br/>
in it awhile we came to the door of a <br/>
house, which was in the line of a high <br/>
wall running north and south, so that we <br/>
could not go around. I opened the door <br/>
and saw the room was filled with large <br/>
serpents, and I shuddered at the sight. <br/>
My [[Henry Brown|companion]] said he would not go <br/>
into the room for fear of the serpents. <br/>
I told him I should try to go through the <br/>
room though they killed me, for the <br/>
Lord had commanded it. As I stepped <br/>
into the room the serpents coiled them-<br/>
selves up, and raised their heads some <br/>
two feet from the floor, to spring at me. <br/>
There was one much larger than the rest <br/>
in the centre of the room, which raised <br/>
his head nearly as high as mine and <br/>
made a spring at me. At that instant I <br/>
felt as though nothing but the [[power of God|power of <br/>
God]] could save me, and I stood still. <br/>
Just before the serpent reached me he <br/>
dropped dead at my feet; all the rest <br/>
dropped dead, swelled up, turned black, <br/>
burst open, took fire and were consumed <br/>
before my eyes, and we went through <br/>
the room unharmed, and thanked God <br/>
for our deliverance.</p>

<p>I awoke in the morning and pondered <br/>
upon the dream. We took breakfast, <br/>
and started on our journey on Sunday <br/>
morning, to visit Mr. Akeman. I re-<br/>
lated to my companion my dream, and <br/>
told him we should see something strange. <br/>
We had great anticipations of meeting <br/>
Mr. Akeman, supposing him to be a <br/>
member of the Church. When we ar-<br/>
rived at his house he received us very <br/>
coldly, and we soon found that he had <br/>
apostatized. He brought railing accusa-<br/>
tions against the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] and <br/>
the authorities of the Church.</p>

<p>Word was sent through all the settle-<br/>
ments on the river for twenty miles that <br/>

<p>The [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] arrived and took the Stand<br/>
and arose in the midst of the congregation and said<br/>
""[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], come and take your Place"" and<br/>
then continued:</p>

<p>""I do not know whether the object of<br/>
the meeting has been told or not. I apologize for<br/>
not coming sooner.</p>

<p>I have had so much on my<br/>
mind since I saw you that I hardly know where<br/>
to begin; but one of the grand objects which I had<br/>
in view in calling this meeting was to make a<br/>
few remarks relative to the laws and ordinances<br/>
and the building of the Temple.</p>

<p>The reason I want to speak of<br/>
the laws is that the officers have difficulties in<br/>
administering the laws. We are republican and<br/>
wish to have the people rule but rule in righteousness.<br/>
Some would complain with what God Himself would<br/>
do. The laws are enacted by petition and they<br/>
can be repealed if they wish it but the people<br/>
ought not to complain of the officers but complain<br/>
of the lawmakers.</p>

<p>I am instructed by the City<br/>
Council to tell this people that if you do not like<br/>
any law which we have passed we will repeal it<br/>
for we are your servants. If any complain of<br/>
our rights and charters it is because they are wicked.<br/>
The Devil is in them.</p>

<p>The reason I call this up is<br/>
we have a simple gang of fellows who do not<br/>
know where their head or elbows are. If you preach</p>",
42660.0,6,,""">April 11, 1814</time>, died in </p>",
42658.0,19,,"<p>virtue to them they will oppose it. If you preach the Methodist<br/>
God to them they will oppose that also or<strike>e</strike> anything else and<br/>
if there is any case tried they want it appealed to [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]].<br/>
Mr [[Orsamus Ferdinand Bostwick|Boswick]]s case had to go there. Our lawyers will<br/>
send anything to Carthage.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] want to know if the citizens will<br/>
sustain me when my hands are raised to heaven for the<br/>
people. I will arraign the person before the people<br/>
who acts against the interest of the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]] and I shall have<br/>
the voice of the people which is republican and <strike>as</strike> likely<br/>
to be the voice of God.</p>

<p>As long as I have a tongue to speak<br/>
I will expose the iniquity of the lawyers and wicked<br/>
men. I fear not their boiling over nor the boiling over<br/>

receive the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] after they were <br/>
baptized, the brethren were condemned; <br/>
but were finally released by paying the <br/>
expenses of the mob court.</p>

<p>There was one peculiar circumstance <br/>
connected with this [[court trial|trial]] by a mob court, <br/>
which was armed to the teeth. When <br/>
the trial was through with, the people <br/>
were not willing to permit more than one <br/>
to speak. Warren Parrish had said but <br/>
few words, and they were not willing <br/>
to let David Patten speak. But he, <br/>
feeling the injustice of the court, and <br/>
being filled with the [[power of God|power of God]], <br/>
arose to his feet and delivered a speech <br/>
of about twenty minutes, holding them <br/>
spell-bound while he told them of their <br/>
wickedness and the abominations that <br/>
they were guilty of, also of the [[curse of God|curse of <br/>
God]] that awaited them, if they did not <br/>
repent, for taking up two harmless, in-<br/>
offensive men for preaching the gospel of <br/>
Christ.</p>

<p>When he had got through his speech <br/>
the judge said, ""You must be armed <br/>
with secret weapons, or you would not <br/>
talk in this fearless manner to an armed <br/>
court.""</p>

<p>Brother Patten replied; ""I have <br/>
weapons that you know not of, and they <br/>
are given me of God, for He gives me <br/>
all the power I have.""</p>

<p>The judge seemed willing to get rid of <br/>
them almost upon any terms, and offered <br/>
to dismiss them if their friends would <br/>
pay the costs, which the brethren pres-<br/>
ent freely offered to do.</p>

<p>When the two were released, they <br/>
mounted their horses and rode a mile to <br/>
Seth Utley's; but, as soon as they had <br/>
left, the court became ashamed that they <br/>
had been let go so easily and the whole <br/>
mob mounted their horses to follow them<br/>
to Utley's.</p>

<p>One of the Saints, seeing the state of <br/>
affairs, went on before the mob to notify <br/>
the brethren, so that they had time to <br/>
ride into the woods near by.</p>

<p>They traveled along about three miles <br/>
to Brother Albert Petty's, and went to <br/>
bed. The night was dark, and they fell <br/>
asleep.</p>

<p>But Brother Patten was warned in a <br/>
dream to get up and flee, as the mob <br/>
would soon be there. They both arose, <br/>
saddled their animals, and rode into the <br/>

both North and [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Fox Islands]], in <br/>
latitude 44° north, and longitude 69° 10' <br/>
west. The population numbered, at the <br/>
time of my visit, about 1,800. The in-<br/>
habitants were intelligent and indus-<br/>
trious, and hospitable to strangers. They <br/>
got most of their wealth and living by <br/>
fishing. The town fitted out over one <br/>
hundred licensed sailing vessels, besides <br/>
smaller craft.</p>

<p>North Fox Island is nine miles long <br/>
by two miles in width and had a popula-<br/>
tion of 800. They had a post office, <br/>
one store, a Baptist church and meeting <br/>
house, four school houses and a tide <br/>
grist mill.</p>

<p>The land was rather poor, yet there <br/>
were some good farms. The products <br/>
were wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and <br/>
grass. The principal timber was fir, <br/>
spruce, hemlock and birch. Raspberries <br/>
and gooseberries grew in great abun-<br/>
dance, and some up-land cranberries <br/>
were raised. The principal stock of the <br/>
island were sheep.</p>

earth I ever saw. It would be difficult <br/>
for any person to describe it. It is about <br/>
ten miles in length by five in width, and <br/>
is one universal mass of rocks, formed <br/>
into shelves, hills, and valleys, and cut <br/>
up into necks and points to make room <br/>
for the coves and harbors that run <br/>
through and through the [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|island]].</p>

<p>The population was 1,000. The in-<br/>
habitants got their living entirely by <br/>
fishing. There is no chance for farming <br/>
upon the island, and but a few garden <br/>
patches, which are cultivated at great <br/>
expense. Some few sheep are raised <br/>
there.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants fish in the <br/>
region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and bring <br/>
their fish home and cure them on flakes <br/>
and prepare them for the market. They <br/>
supply the market with great quantities <br/>
of cod, mackerel and boxed herring.</p>

<p>Upon this island there were two stores,<br/>
three tide saw mills, six school houses <br/>
and a small branch of the [[Methodist|Methodist]] <br/>
church, presided over by a priest.</p>

<p>What timber there is upon this island,<br/>
such as pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and <br/>
birch, and the whortleberries, raspberries<br/>
and gooseberries, mostly grow out of <br/>
the cracks of the rocks.</p>

<p>Great quantities of fish, and in almost <br/>
endless variety, inhabit the coves and <br/>
harbors around the islands. The whale, <br/>
blackfish, shark, ground shark, pilot-fish, <br/>
horse mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, hali-<br/>
but, cod, polleck, tom cod, hake, had-<br/>
dock, mackerel, shad bass, alewife,<br/>

<p>Thus I have given a brief description<br/>
of [[Vinalhaven, Waldo County, Maine|Vinal Haven]]. It was quite dark <br/>
when we landed there, without a farthing<br/>
in money. We made our way over the <br/>
rocks and through the cedars the best <br/>
way we could, until we found a house, <br/>
when we rapped at the door. A woman<br/>
put her head out of the window and asked <br/>
who was there and what was wanted.</p>

<p>I told her we were two strangers, and <br/>
wanted a bed to lie down upon until <br/>
morning.</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
She let us in and gave us a bed, and <br/>
we slept until quite late, it being Sunday <br/>
morning. When we came out and took <br/>
breakfast it was nearly noon. I asked <br/>
her what she charged for our entertain-<br/>
ment, and she replied that we were wel-<br/>
come.</p>

<p>I then asked her if there was any <br/>
religion or minister or church on the <br/>
island.</p>

<p>She informed me there was a [[Baptist|Baptist]] <br/>
minister, by the name of [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], who <br/>
had a congregation and meeting house <br/>
about five miles from there.</p>

<p>We thanked her for her kindness, <br/>
walked to the meeting house and stepped <br/>
inside the doorway. We stood there <br/>
until a deacon came to the door, when I <br/>
asked him to go and tell the minister in <br/>
the pulpit that there were two servants <br/>
of God at the door, who had a message<br/>
to deliver to that people and wished the <br/>
privilege of delivering it.</p>

<p>He sent for us to come to the pulpit, <br/>
so we walked through the congregation <br/>
with our valises under our arms, and <br/>
took a seat by the side of the minister, <br/>
who was about to speak as we came to <br/>
the door.</p>

<p>He arose and delivered his discourse <br/>
to the people, occupying about half an <br/>
hour. When he closed he asked me <br/>
what was my wish.</p>

<p>1 told him we wished to speak to the <br/>
people at any hour that would suit his <br/>
or their convenience; so he gave notice <br/>
that there were two strangers present<br/>
who would speak to the people at five<br/>
o'clock that evening.</p>

<p>We were quite a source of wonder-<br/>
ment to the people, as they had no idea <br/>
who we were.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton asked us home to tea <br/>
with him, and we gladly accepted the <br/>
invitation. When we arrived at his <br/>
house I opened my valise and took out <br/>
the [[Bible|Bible]], [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], and [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doc-<br/>
trine and Covenants]], laid them upon <br/>
the table, and took my seat.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton took up the books and <br/>
looked at them, but said nothing. I <br/>
then asked him if there were any school <br/>
houses upon the island. and if so, <br/>
whether they were free to preach in. <br/>
He answered that there were four, num-<br/>
bered respectively from one to four, and <br/>
that they were free.</p>

soon rolled over our heads. It had the <br/>

seemed to be gradually sinking, and in<br/>
the evening the spirit apparently left her <br/>
body, and she was dead.</p>

<p>The sisters gathered around her body,<br/>
weeping, while I stood looking at her in<br/>
sorrow. The [[spirit of God|spirit]] and [[power of God|power of God]] <br/>
began to rest upon me until, for the first<br/>
time during her sickness, faith filled my<br/>
soul, although she lay before me as one <br/>
dead.</p>

<p>I had some [[consecrated oil|oil]] that was consecrated<br/>
for my anointing while in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. I <br/>
took it and consecrated it again before<br/>
the Lord for anointing the sick. I then<br/>
bowed down before the Lord and prayed<br/>
for the life of my companion, and I <br/>
anointed her body with the oil in the<br/>
name of the Lord. I laid my hands<br/>
upon her, and in the name of Jesus <br/>
Christ I rebuked the power of death and<br/>
the destroyer, and commanded the same<br/>
to depart from her and the [[spirit of life|spirit of life]]<br/>

<p>Her spirit returned to her body, and <br/>

the places of those who have fallen, and <br/>
be officially notified of their appoint-<br/>
ment.'""</p>

<p>It will be observed that this differs<br/>
from nearly all other revelations in this <br/>
respect: a fixed day and a stated place<br/>
were given for the commencement of <br/>
the mission. When the revelation was<br/>
given, all was peace and quietude in Far<br/>
West, Missouri, the city where most of <br/>
the [[Latter-day Saints|Latter day Saints]] dwelt; but before <br/>
the time came for its fulfillment, the<br/>
Saints of God had been driven out of <br/>
the State of Missouri into the State of<br/>
[[Illinois|Illinois]], under the edict of Governor <br/>
[[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]; and the Missourians had sworn<br/>
that if all the other revelations of Joseph<br/>
Smith were fulfilled, that should not be. <br/>
It stated the day and the place where the<br/>
Twelve Apostles should take leave of the<br/>
Saints, to go on their missions across the <br/>
great waters, and the mobocrats of Mis-<br/>
souri had declared that they would see <br/>
that it should not be fulfilled.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the Lord, having<br/>
a foreknowledge of what would take <br/>
place, had given the revelation in this<br/>
manner to see whether the Apostles <br/>
would obey it at the risk of their lives.</p>

<p>When the time drew near for the ful-<br/>
fillment of this commandment of the <br/>
Lord, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] was the President <br/>
of the Twelve Apostles; [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B.<br/>
Marsh]], who was the senior Apostle, had <br/>
fallen. Brother Brigham called together<br/>
those of the Twelve who were then at <br/>
[[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], Illinois, to see what their minds <br/>
would be about going to Far West, to<br/>
fulfill the revelation. The Prophet Jos-</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
eph and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rig-<br/>
don]], [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>
were in prison in Missouri at the time; <br/>
but Father [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], the [[Patriarch|Patriarch]],<br/>
was at Quincy, Illinois. He and others <br/>
who were present did not think it wis-<br/>
dom for us to attempt the journey, as <br/>
our lives would be in great jeopardy. <br/>
They thought the Lord would take the<br/>
will for the deed. But when President <br/>
Young asked the Twelve what our feel-<br/>
ings were upon the subject, we all of us, <br/>
as the voice of one man, said the Lord <br/>
God had spoken, and it was for us to <br/>
obey. It was the Lord's business to take<br/>
care of His servants, and we would ful-<br/>
fill the commandment, or die trying.</p>

<p>To fully understand the risk the<br/>
Twelve ran in making this journey, my<br/>
readers should remember that Lilburn <br/>
W. Boggs, governor of the State of Mis-<br/>
souri, had issued a proclamation, in <br/>
which all the Latter-day Saints were re-<br/>
quired to leave that State or be exter-<br/>
minated. Far West had been captured <br/>
by the militia, who were really only an<br/>
organized mob; the citizens had been<br/>
compelled to give up their arms; all the <br/>
leading men who could be got hold of<br/>
had been taken prisoners; the rest of <br/>
the Saints—men, women and children— <br/>
had to flee as best they could out of the <br/>
State to save their lives, leaving all their <br/>
houses, lands and other property which <br/>
they could not carry with them to be <br/>
taken by the mob. In fact they shot <br/>
down the cattle and hogs of the Saints <br/>
wherever they could find them, and <br/>
robbed them of nearly everything they<br/>
could lay their hands upon. Latter-day<br/>
Saints were treated with merciless cruelty <br/>
and had to endure the most outrageous <br/>
abuses. It was with the greatest diffi-<br/>
culty that many of them got out of the <br/>
State, especially the prominent men; for<br/>
there were many men of that State at <br/>
that time, who acted as though they <br/>
thought it no more harm to shoot a <br/>
Mormon than a mad dog. From this <br/>
brief explanation you will be able to un-<br/>
derstand why some of the brethren <br/>
thought we were not required to go back <br/>
to Far West to start from there upon our<br/>
mission across the ocean to Europe.</p>

with five others of the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve, I rode four miles out of town to<br/>
Mr. [[John Cleveland|Cleveland's]], to visit Brother Joseph <br/>
Smith and his family.</p>

<p>Once more I had the happy privilege <br/>
of taking Brother Joseph by the hand. <br/>
Two years had rolled away since I had <br/>
seen his face. He greeted us with great <br/>
joy, as did Hyrum Smith and [[Lyman Wight|Lyman <br/>

their imprisonment together. They had <br/>
been confined in prison six months, and <br/>
had been under sentence of death three <br/>

and they were now mingling with their<br/>
wives, children and friends, and out of<br/>

frank, open and familiar as usual, and <br/>

called upon the Lord in prayer, and the<br/>
[[power of God|power of God]] rested upon him mightily,<br/>
and as Jesus healed all the sick around<br/>
Him in His day, so Joseph, the Prophet<br/>
of God, healed all around on this occa-<br/>
sion. He healed all in his house and<br/>
door-yard, then, in company with Sidney<br/>
Rigdon and several of the Twelve, he <br/>
went through among the sick lying on<br/>
the bank of the river, and he com-<br/>
manded them in a loud voice, in the<br/>

be made whole, and they were all healed.<br/>

the west side, to Montrose, where we <br/>
were. The first house they went into <br/>
was President Brigham Young's. He<br/>
was sick on his bed at the time. The<br/>
Prophet went into his house and healed<br/>
him, and they all came out together.<br/>
As they were passing by my door, Brother<br/>
Joseph said: ""Brother Woodruff, fol-<br/>
low me."" These were the only words </p>",

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
spoken by any of the company from the <br/>
time they left Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham's]] house<br/>
till we crossed the public square, and <br/>
entered Brother [[Elijah Fordham|Fordham's]] house. Bro-<br/>
ther Fordham had been dying for an<br/>
hour, and we expected each minute<br/>
would be his last.</p>

<p>I felt the [[power of God|power of God]] that was<br/>
overwhelming His [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]].</p>

<p>When we entered the house, Brother <br/>
Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham,<br/>
and took him by the right hand; in his<br/>
left hand he held his hat.</p>

<p>He saw that Brother Fordham's eyes<br/>
were glazed, and that he was speechless <br/>
and unconscious.</p>

<p>After taking hold of his hand, he <br/>
looked down into the dying man's face<br/>
and said: ""Brother Fordham do you<br/>
not know me?"" At first he made no <br/>
reply; but we could all see the effect of <br/>
the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]] resting upon him.</p>

<p>He again said: ""Elijah, do you not<br/>
know me?""</p>

<p>With a low whisper, Brother Ford-<br/>
ham answered, ""Yes!""</p>

<p>The Prophet then said, ""Have you <br/>
not faith to be healed?""</p>

<p>The answer, which was a little plainer<br/>
than before, was: ""I am afraid it is too<br/>
late. If you had come sooner, I think<br/>
it might have been.""</p>

<p>He had the appearance of a man wak-<br/>
ing from sleep. It was the sleep of <br/>
death.</p>

<p>Joseph then said: ""Do you believe<br/>
that Jesus is the Christ?""</p>

<p>""I do, Brother Joseph,"" was the re-<br/>
ponse.</p>

<p>Then the Prophet of God spoke with<br/>
a loud voice, as in the majesty of the <br/>
Godhead: ""Elijah, I command you, in<br/>
the name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise<br/>
and be made whole!''</p>

<p>The words of the Prophet were not <br/>
like the words of man, but like the [[voice of God|voice<br/>
of God]]. It seemed to me that the<br/>
house shook from its foundation.</p>

<p>Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed <br/>
like a man raised from the dead. A <br/>
healthy color came to his face, and life <br/>
was manifested in every act.</p>

<p>His feet were done up in Indian meal <br/>
[[poultices|poultices]]. He kicked them off his feet, <br/>
scattered the contents, and then called <br/>
for his clothes and put them on. He<br/>
asked for a bowl of bread and milk, and<br/>
ate it; then put on his hat and followed</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
us into the street, to visit others who<br/>
were sick.</p>

<p>The unbeliever may ask: ""Was there <br/>
not deception in this?""</p>

<p>If there is any deception in the mind <br/>
of the unbeliever, there was certainly <br/>
none with Elijah Fordham, the dying <br/>
man, nor with those who were present<br/>
with him, for in a few minutes he would<br/>
have been in the [[spirit world|spirit world]], had he <br/>
not been rescued. Through the bless-<br/>
ing of God, he lived up till 1880, in <br/>
which year he died in [[Utah Territory|Utah]], while all <br/>
who were with him on that occasion,<br/>
with the exception of one, are in the<br/>
[[spirit world|spirit world]].</p>

<p>Among the number were Joseph and <br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], Brigham<br/>
Young, [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[George Albert Smith|George A. <br/>

Wilford Woodruff is the only one living <br/>
who was present at that time, and he <br/>
will soon mingle with those who have<br/>
gone.</p>

<p>As soon as we left Brother Fordham's<br/>
house, we went into the house of [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph<br/>
B. Noble]], who was very low and danger-<br/>
ously sick.</p>

<p>When we entered the house, Brother<br/>
Joseph took him by the hand, and com-<br/>
manded him, in the name of Jesus<br/>
Christ, to arise and be made whole. <br/>
He did arise and was immediately<br/>
healed.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the wicked<br/>
mob in the place, led by one [[David Wells Kilbourne|Kilburn]],<br/>
had become alarmed, and followed us <br/>
into Brother Noble's house.</p>

<p>Before they arrived there, Brother <br/>
Joseph had called upon Brother Ford-<br/>
ham to offer prayer.</p>

<p>While he was praying, the mob en-<br/>
tered, with all the [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] accom-<br/>
panying them.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered, Brother <br/>
Fordham, who was praying, fainted and <br/>
sank to the floor.</p>

<p>When Joseph saw the mob in the<br/>
house, he arose and had the room cleared<br/>
of both that class of men and their at-<br/>
tendant devils. Then Brother Fordham<br/>
immediately revived and finished his <br/>
prayer.</p>

<p>This case of Brother Noble's was the<br/>

<p>President Rigdon was mouth in bless-<br/>
ing me, and also blessed Sisters [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]], <br/>
[[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]].</p>

would be faithful, we should be blessed<br/>
upon our mission, have many souls as <br/>
seals of our ministry, and return again<br/>
in peace and safety to our families and<br/>
friends; all of which was fulfilled.</p>

<p>Brother Hyrum advised me to preach</p>

the first principles of the gospel; he<br/>
thought that was about as much as this<br/>
generation could endure.</p>

<p>Then Joseph arose and preached some <br/>
precious things of the [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]] <br/>
unto us, in the power of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]]; <br/>
some of which I here copy from my <br/>
journal:</p>

repentance and desire for forgiveness;<br/>

as merciful unto us. We also ought to <br/>

and beware of pride and not seek to ex-<br/>
cel one another, but act for each other's<br/>

[[Elders of Israel|elders of Israel]] should seek to learn by<br/>
precept and example in this late age of<br/>
the world and not be obliged to learn <br/>
everything we know by sad experience. <br/>
I trust the remainder of the Twelve will<br/>
learn wisdom and not follow the example<br/>
of those who have fallen. When the <br/>
Twelve, or any other witnesses of Jesus<br/>
Christ, stand before the congregations<br/>
of the earth, and they preach in the <br/>
power and demonstration of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy <br/>

and confounded at the doctrine, and say<br/>

take care that they do not ascribe the <br/>
glory unto themselves, but be careful<br/>
that they are humble, and ascribe the<br/>
glory to God and the Lamb; for it is by <br/>
the power of the [[Holy Priesthood|Holy Priesthood]] and<br/>

<p>After various principles of the Church<br/>
had been expounded by the Apostles <br/>
present, the council adjourned.</p>

<p>Elder Willard Richards had been <br/>
called to be one of the quorum of the<br/>
Twelve Apostles, but had not yet re-<br/>
ceived his ordination.</p>

<p>On the day following I parted with<br/>
Elders Taylor and Fielding, who went<br/>
to Liverpool, and with Elder Richards,<br/>
who tarried in Preston. Elder Turley <br/>
and I went to Manchester.</p>

<p>It was the first time I ever visited that <br/>
city. I here first met with Elder Wm. <br/>
Clayton. As soon as I had an introduc-<br/>
tion to him, he informed me that one of <br/>
the sisters in that place was possessed of <br/>
the [[Devil|devil]], and he asked me to go and <br/>
cast it out of her, thinking that one of <br/>
the Twelve Apostles could do anything<br/>
in this line he might wish to.</p>

<p>However, I went with him to the <br/>
house where the woman lay, in the hands <br/>
of three men, in a terrible rage, and <br/>
trying to tear her clothing from her.</p>

<p>I also found quite a number of Saints <br/>
present, and some unbelievers, who had <br/>
come to see the devil cast out and a<br/>
miracle wrought.</p>

<p>If I had acted upon my own judg-<br/>
ment I should not have attempted to ad-<br/>
minister to her with the company pres-<br/>
ent, but as I was a stranger there, and <br/>
Brother Clayton presided over the <br/>
branch, I joined him in administering to <br/>
the woman. But the unbelief of the <br/>
wicked present was so great, we could <br/>
not cast the devil out of her, and she <br/>
raged worse than ever.</p>

<p>I then ordered the room to be cleared, <br/>
and when the company left the house, <br/>
except the few attending to her, we [[laying on of hands|laid <br/>
hands]] upon her, and I commanded the <br/>
devil to come out of her, in the name of <br/>
Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and <br/>
she was entirely cured and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next day being the Sabbath, she <br/>
came before a large congregation of peo-<br/>
ple, and bore testimony to what the <br/>
Lord had done for her. We had a large<br/>
assemblage through the day and evening, <br/>
to whom I preached the gospel.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the devil, not <br/>
being satisfied with being cast out of the<br/>
woman, entered into her little child, <br/>
which was but a few months old.</p>",
42659.0,36,,""">4th</time> I again <br/>
took coach, and rode through [[Dudley, Staffordshire, England|Dudley]], <br/>
[[Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England|Stourbridge]], [[Stourport, Worcestershire, England|Stourport]] and [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]], <br/>
and then walked a number of miles to <br/>
Mr. [[John Benbow|John Benbow's]], [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill Farm]], [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castle <br/>
Frome]], Ledbury, Herefordshire. This <br/>
was a farming country in the south of <br/>
England, a region where no Elder of the<br/>
Latter-day Saints had visited.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthy <br/>
farmer, cultivating three hundred acres<br/>
of land, occupying a good mansion, and<br/>
having plenty of means. His wife, [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Jane]], <br/>
had no children.</p>

<p>I presented myself to him as a mission-<br/>
ary from America, an Elder of the <br/>
[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day <br/>
Saints]], who had been sent to him by the <br/>
commandment of God as a messenger of <br/>
salvation, to preach the gospel of life <br/>
unto him and his household, and the in-<br/>
habitants of the land.</p>

<p>Mr. Benbow and his wife received me <br/>
with glad hearts and thanksgiving. It <br/>
was in the evening when I arrived, hav-<br/>
ing traveled forty-eight miles by coach <br/>
and on foot during the day, but after<br/>
receiving refreshments we sat down to-<br/>
gether, and conversed until two o'clock<br/>
in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Benbow and his wife rejoiced <br/>
greatly at the glad tidings which I <br/>
brought unto them of the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness of the<br/>
everlasting gospel]], which God had re-<br/>
vealed through the mouth of His Prophet,<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], in these [[last days|last days]].</p>

<p>I rejoiced greatly at the news that Mr.<br/>
Benbow gave me, that there was a <br/>
company of men and women—over six <br/>
hundred in number—who had broken off <br/>
from the Wesleyan [[Methodist|Methodists]], and taken<br/>
the name of [[United Brethren|United Brethren]]. They <br/>
had forty-five preachers among them, <br/>
and had chapels and many houses that </p>",
42659.0,37,,""">8th</time>, I preached at <br/>
[[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]] in the morning, at [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Stand-<br/>
ley Hill]] in the afternoon, and at John <br/>
Benbow's, [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill Farm]], in the evening.</p>

<p>The [[St. Michael and All Angels Parish Church, Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|parish church]] that stood in the <br/>
neighborhood of Brother Benbow's, pre-<br/>
sided over by the [[Henry Fisher|rector]] of the parish, <br/>
was attended during the day by only fif-<br/>
teen persons, while I had a large congre-<br/>
gation, estimated to number a thousand, <br/>
attend my meeting through the day and<br/>
evening.</p>

<p>When I arose in the evening to speak <br/>
at Brother Benbow's house, a man en-<br/>
tered the door and informed me that he</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
was a constable, and had been sent by<br/>
the rector of the parish with a warrant <br/>
to arrest me.</p>

<p>I asked him ""For what crime?""</p>

<p>He said, ""For preaching to the peo-<br/>
ple.""</p>

<p>I told him that I, as well as the rec-<br/>
tor, had a license for preaching the gos-<br/>
pel to the people, and that if he would <br/>
take a chair I would wait upon him after<br/>
meeting.</p>

<p>He took my chair and sat beside me. <br/>
I preached the first principles of the<br/>
everlasting gospel for an hour and a <br/>
quarter. The [[power of God|power of God]] rested upon <br/>
me, the Spirit filled the house, and the <br/>
people were convinced.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting I opened<br/>
a door for baptism, and seven offered<br/>
themselves. Among the number were <br/>
four preachers and the constable.</p>

<p>The latter arose and said, ""Mr. Wood-<br/>
ruff, I would like to be baptized.""</p>

<p>I told him I would like to baptize <br/>
him. I went down to the pool and bap-<br/>
tized the seven. We then met together <br/>
and I confirmed thirteen, and broke <br/>
bread unto the Saints and we all rejoiced <br/>
together.</p>

<p>The constable went to the rector and <br/>
told him if he wanted Mr. Woodruff <br/>
taken up for preaching the gospel, he<br/>
must go himself and serve the writ, for <br/>
he had heard him preach the only true<br/>
gospel sermon he had ever listened to in <br/>
his life.</p>

<p>The rector did not know what to make <br/>
of it, so he sent two clerks of the [[Church of England|Church <br/>
of England]] as spies, to attend our meet-<br/>
ing, and find out what we did preach.</p>

<p>But they were both pricked in their <br/>
hearts and received the [[word of the Lord|word of the <br/>
Lord]] gladly, and were baptized and con-<br/>
firmed members of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus <br/>
Christ of Latter-day Saints]].</p>

<p>The rector became alarmed and did <br/>
not dare to send anybody else.</p>

<p>The ministers and rectors of the South <br/>
of England called a convention and <br/>
sent a petition to the Archbishop of <br/>
[[Canterbury, Kent, England|Canterbury]], to request parliament to<br/>
pass a law prohibiting the Mormons <br/>
from preaching in the British dominion.</p>

<p>In this petition the rector stated that <br/>
one ""Mormon"" missionary had baptized <br/>
fifteen hundred persons, mostly members<br/>
of the English church, during the last <br/>
seven months.</p>",

gave us refreshments and then directed <br/>

42659.0,40,,""">August the 30th</time>, walked three miles <br/>
and stopped in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]], Old <br/>
Street, where we found an [[Aitkenite|Aitkenite]] <br/>
preaching to the people, who was fol-<br/>
lowed by a [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]]. Just as the <br/>
latter was about to begin, Elder Kimball<br/>
informed him that there was a preacher<br/>
from America present who would like to<br/>
speak when he got through. The preacher <br/>
then informed the people that there was <br/>
an American minister present, and pro-<br/>
posed that he should speak first. Elder <br/>
George A. Smith then got into the chair,<br/>
and spoke about twenty minutes, and<br/>
then the Presbyterian spoke. George A.<br/>
had informed the people that there were<br/>
two other American preachers present <br/>
who would like to address them, and, <br/>
when the Presbyterian closed, Elder <br/>
Kimball asked him if there would be any <br/>
objection to our preaching there at three<br/>
o'clock. He answered, ""No, not at all. <br/>
What denomination do you belong to?'' <br/>
""To the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-<br/>
ter-day Saints]],"" was the reply.</p>

<p>""Oh, I have heard of them,"" he said.<br/>
""They are a bad people; they have done <br/>
much hurt; they divide churches; we <br/>
don't want to hear you.""</p>

<p>He then mounted the chair again and <br/>
said to the people, ""I have just heard<br/>
that the last man who spoke belongs to<br/>
the Latter-day Saints,"" and he began to<br/>
rail against us.</p>

<p>Elder Kimball asked him to let him <br/>
step into the chair to give out an ap-<br/>
pointment for a 3 o'clock meeting, but<br/>
he would not let him. Brother Kimball <br/>
then raised his voice and informed the<br/>
people that some American preachers <br/>
would preach there at 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>At the appointed time we were at the <br/>
place. The conduct of the preacher and<br/>
the excitement upon the subject brought <br/>
a large congregation to hear us. I <br/>
opened the meeting by singing and<br/>
prayer and spoke about twenty minutes, <br/>
from ##Galatians 1:8-9|Gal. I. 8-9 v.##, and was followed by <br/>
Elder Kimball for about the same length <br/>
of time. The people gave good attention<br/>
and seemed to be much interested in <br/>
what they heard.</p>

<p>After meeting, Mr. Corner invited us<br/>
home; but soon after we arrived, at his <br/>
house, Elder Kimball felt impressed to <br/>
return to the place of preaching. When <br/>

hands with hundreds of Saints with glad<br/>
hearts and cheerful countenances. It is <br/>
with no ordinary feelings that I meditate <br/>
upon the cheering fact that a thousand <br/>
souls have been baptized into the [[new and everlasting covenant|new<br/>

enable me to stand with these Saints<br/>
and all the righteous in His [[celestial kingdom|celestial <br/>

<p>This day I had stood upon my feet <br/>
eight hours in conference, conversed <br/>
much of the time in suggesting, speak-<br/>
ing, motioning, etc.; ordained about<br/>
thirty, confirmed some, healed many <br/>
who were sick, shook hands with about<br/>
four hundred Saints, walked two miles,<br/>
and ended with about four hours chim-<br/>

to rest and dreamt of catching fish.</p>

exertion was made by them to stay its<br/>
progress. They were finding that the <br/>
Lord was delivering their flocks out of<br/>
their hands and giving them unto the <br/>
shepherds of the Church of the Saints. <br/>
They were alarmed and were holding <br/>
conventions and meetings to contrive<br/>
plans and adopt means to overthrow the<br/>

on the next evening at [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] to a <br/>

42659.0,44,,""">14th of October</time><br/>
to return to my labors in London; and <br/>
on my way, with Elder Alfred Cordon,<br/>
I visited the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]] and <br/>
[[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]. On the 17th I arrived in <br/>
London, where I found Elder George A.<br/>
Smith, and we were glad to meet each <br/>
other once again.</p>

<p>We hired lodgings, board and sitting <br/>
room at No. 40 Ironmonger Row, St. <br/>
Luke's. Everything was dear, and we <br/>
found with the greatest economy we <br/>
could not do with much less than a pound <br/>
per week each. What few Saints there <br/>
were in London were very poor and</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
unable to assist us. Most of the means <br/>
used in my labors in London was sup-<br/>
plied by my converts of Herefordshire.</p>

<p>The prospect in London at that time <br/>
was the darkest I had ever been in since<br/>
entering the vineyard, but the Lord was<br/>
with us and we were not discouraged.</p>

<p>Sunday we met with the Saints at <br/>
Brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] three times, read in the <br/>
[[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], gave instruction and<br/>
broke bread unto them. We had a good <br/>
time, though there was only about half <br/>
a dozen present. I felt the spirit bear<br/>
testimony that there would be a work<br/>
done in London.</p>

<p>I fell asleep, having retired to rest in <br/>
good season, and slept until midnight,<br/>
when I awoke and meditated upon the<br/>
things of God until 3 o'clock in the morn-<br/>
ing, and while forming a determination<br/>
to warn the people in London and over-<br/>
come the power of darkness by the assist-<br/>
ance of God, a person appeared unto me <br/>
whom I consider was the [[Prince of Darkness|prince of dark-<br/>
ness]]. He made war upon me and at-<br/>
tempted to take my life. He caught me by <br/>
the throat and nearly choked me to death.<br/>
He wounded me in my forehead and I <br/>
also wounded him in a number of places<br/>
in the head. As he was about to over-<br/>
come me I prayed to the Father in the <br/>
name of Jesus Christ for help. I then<br/>
had power over him and he left me,<br/>
though much wounded. Afterwards<br/>
three persons dressed in white came to <br/>
me and prayed with me and I was im-<br/>
mediately healed of all my wounds and<br/>
delivered of all my troubles.</p>

<p>During the following week we visited<br/>
the [[British Museum, London, Middlesex, England|British Museum]] and other notable<br/>
places, and also attended a Wesleyan <br/>
[[Methodist|Methodist]] mission meeting over which<br/>
the Lord Mayor presided; while in the </p>",

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
[[Barrett|Academy]], at which there were about fifty<br/>

<p>An Independent minister invited me<br/>
home to take tea with him. I accepted <br/>
his invitation, had an interesting time<br/>
and preached the Gospel to him and he<br/>
received my testimony and offered me his<br/>
chapel, which would hold 800. He said he<br/>
thought he would be baptized and would<br/>
try and get his society to do the same.</p>

<p>We met again in the evening and had <br/>
more at our meeting than ever before.<br/>
Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] preached and <br/>
was followed by Brothers Kimball, Wil-<br/>
liams, [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]], Hulme and myself.</p>

<p>We had a very interesting time and <br/>
one offered himself for baptism. There<br/>
were some of the [[Aitkenite|Aikenites]] present, one <br/>
of whom purchased a hymn book. They <br/>
wished us to call upon them and thought<br/>
they would be baptized. We then met <br/>
at Father Corner's and communed with<br/>
the Saints and had a good time.</p>

<p>I rejoiced at the prospect which was <br/>
opening before us, for we labored a long <br/>
time and the work had gone slow, but <br/>
now a wide opening was being made to <br/>
roll on the [[work of the Lord|work of the Lord]] in the me-<br/>
tropolis of England.</p>

<p>Having spent about ten days in Lon-<br/>

On the same day I visited Mr. [[James Albon|James <br/>

our doctrine, and on the Sunday we found <br/>
more than ever an interest being awak-<br/>

the next evening was attended by the <br/>
Reverend James Albon, who received our <br/>
testimony. We walked home with him <br/>
and found his household growing in the <br/>
faith and ready for the work of the Lord.</p>

<p>Two days after in the evening we bap-<br/>
tized four, two of whom were [[Benjamin Morgan|Mr.]] and<br/>
Mrs [[Elizabeth George Morgan|Morgan]], with whom we lodged, <br/>
[[Christopher Smith|Christopher, Smith]] their apprentice, and<br/>
[[Henry Corner Jr.|Henry Corner, Jun.]]</p>

<p>The afternoon of the following day<br/>
Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland]] spent with us, and he re-<br/>
ceived our testimony, and in the evening <br/>
we preached at our meeting place.</p>

<p>I had visited the Rev. James Albon <br/>
several times and given him an account <br/>
of the rise and progress of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church <br/>
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. <br/>
He believed in our mission and offered <br/>
me his chapel to preach in, which would <br/>
seat about a thousand.</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
Sunday morning we accompanied our <br/>
reverend friend and convert to his chapel<br/>
and were introduced to the committee, <br/>
one of whom was a preacher who had<br/>
traveled much in [[Russia|Russia]] and other parts <br/>
of the world. At the close of the meet-<br/>
ing the Rev. James Albon gave out an <br/>
appointment for us to preach on the next <br/>
Sabbath evening.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we met with the<br/>
Saints, confirmed four and had a full <br/>
house, and in the evening we preached<br/>
again and a good feeling prevailed.</p>

<p>After meeting the Rev. James Albon <br/>
called upon us at our room and told us <br/>
that he had given out our appointment<br/>
to preach in his chapel and had informed<br/>
his congregation that he was a Latter-day <br/>
Saint, and should be baptized and join <br/>
our Church, and that they need not<br/>
longer consider him a member of their <br/>
body unless they with him joined the<br/>
Saints. He told us this made a division <br/>
among the committee; some were for <br/>
going with him and some against follow-<br/>
ing their pastor into the true fold which <br/>
he had found.</p>

<p>The Sunday following in the evening <br/>
we preached, by the appointment of its<br/>
minister, in the Independent chapel to<br/>
the largest congregation we had ever dis-<br/>
coursed before in London. There were  <br/>
present priests and people of many de-<br/>
nominations. I addressed them for<br/>
about the space of one hour. A Wes-<br/>
leyan minister arose and opposed me,<br/>
which had a good effect, for the congre-<br/>
gation seeing the spirit he was of turned <br/>
against him, and the committee refused <br/>
him the permission to speak there any <br/>
more. I was much bound by the oppos-<br/>
ing spirit, still the conduct of the enemy <br/>
gave us friends.</p>

<p>The next evening we attended what <br/>
was said to have been the largest temper-<br/>
ance meeting ever held in London, and <br/>
the next two days brought us to the<br/>
close of the year.</p>

The meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock and<br/>
one person was baptized.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Elder Levi Richards <br/>
spoke and I followed him. After meet-<br/>
ing the Saints contributed one pound to <br/>
help me, and sold them three books of <br/>
Mormon and fifty addresses to the citi-<br/>
zens of London. I then walked five <br/>
miles with Brother Richards to Brother <br/>
[[John Holley|Holley's]] and spent the night. This was <br/>
the first time I had seen Brother Levi for <br/>
about two years.</p>

<p>Next day in company of Elders Levi<br/>
Richards and [[Thomas Pitt|Thomas Pitt]] I walked to <br/>
the city of [[Hereford, Herefordshire, England|Hereford]], where Elder [[William Kay|Ray]] <br/>
and others had been preaching.</p>

<p>On Sunday a preacher arose before two <br/>
or three thousand people in the market<br/>
house and informed the multitude that<br/>
he had a fresh letter direct from America, <br/>
showing the origin of the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mor-<br/>
mon]]. So he read the old Spaulding<br/>
story. When he got through Elder Levi <br/>
Richards arose and informed the people<br/>
that instead of its being a new story it<br/>
had been published for seven years <br/>
throughout the United States and in<br/>
England. This caused a great uproar, for <br/>
while some were for driving the man out<br/>
of the place for lying, others were crowding<br/>
around Elders Richards and Ray to hear <br/>
them preach. The crowd, however, was so <br/>
excited that they left the ground with <br/>
hundreds following them. There never <br/>
was a time when the people were so much<br/>
stirred up and eager to hear the[[Latter-day Saints| Latter-<br/>
day Saints]] as at the present, and it was<br/>
expected that we should not get through<br/>
the city without having crowds around<br/>
us. We did, however, and had a view of <br/>
Hereford Cathedral as we passed along <br/>
and reached Sister Bufton's.</p>

<p>There was at this time a small branch<br/>
of the Church at Hereford, numbering<br/>
seven members. We parted from Brother<br/>
Pitt at Hereford, and continued to [[Lugwardine, Herefordshire, England|Lug-<br/>
wardine]], where I met with the Church for<br/>
the last time and preached from the ##Isaiah 24|24th## <br/>
of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].</p>

<p>On the morrow I walked to [[Shucknall Hill, Herefordshire, England|Shucknell <br/>
Hill]] and had an interesting meeting with<br/>
the Saints and preached upon the gather-<br/>
ing to Zion and Jerusalem. It was my<br/>
last meeting with them and I bid them<br/>
farewell. Next day I walked to [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley]] </p>",

[[Brangreen, Newent, Gloucestershire, England|Bran Green]] and [[Gadfield Elm, Worcestershire, England|Gadfield Elm]] con-<br/>
ference again assembled, when the meet-<br/>
ing was called to order by Elder Wood-<br/>
ruff.</p>

<p>There were present one of the quorum <br/>
of the Twelve Apostles, 1 high priest; 10 <br/>
elders 21 priests 6 teachers and 1<br/>
Deacon, besides the congregation of the<br/>
Saints. There were represented nineteen<br/>
churches; 367 members, 8 elders, 33 <br/>
priests, 11 teachers, 1 deacon, removed<br/>
41, died 1, expelled 2.</p>

<p>WILFORD WOODRUFF, <i>President</i>. <br/>
[[John Hill|JOHN HILL]], <i>Clerk</i>.</p>

<p>We had a very interesting time at the <br/>
conference and a large assembly of the <br/>
Saints. It was the last time that I should <br/>
attend in that part of my old and beloved <br/>
field of labor, during my present mission<br/>
to England, and whether or not I should <br/>
ever meet here in a conference assembly <br/>
of Saints again was one of the secrets of <br/>
my future life for time to reveal. We <br/>
had held our meeting without disturbance<br/>
from the mob who were present, for<br/>
they were kept quiet by the police in at-<br/>
tendance who were in disguise.</p>

<p>No sooner had the meeting closed than<br/>
multitudes of the Saints crowded around<br/>
me and hands were presented me on <br/>
every side, to bid me farewell. Many<br/>
called for me to bless them before I de-<br/>
parted. Others cried out, ""Lay hands<br/>
upon me and heal me before you go.""</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
One came with, ""Brother Woodruff, I am <br/>
turned out of doors for my religion; <br/>
what shall I do?'' Another with, ""I am <br/>
ready to go to Zion, but my wife won't go <br/>
with me; shall I leave her to gather with<br/>
the Saints?"" A wife in turn says, ""My <br/>
husband beat me and turned me out of <br/>
doors because I have been baptized. I <br/>
have money enough to carry me and the<br/>
children to Zion; will you let me go with-<br/>
out him?"" ""Brother Woodruff, my <br/>
mother is over 80 years of age and has <br/>
willed me 60 pounds at her death, but <br/>
will not emigrate with me; must I stay <br/>
for her to die or leave her now to go with <br/>
the Saints?"" One said, ""I have sold <br/>
my little place and shall have 30 pounds <br/>
to-morrow, but must go out into the<br/>
street. I have not enough to carry my<br/>
family to America; can you help me to a <br/>
few pounds or tell me what to do?"" And<br/>
an Elder cried out, ""How much longer <br/>
must I preach in England before you will<br/>
let me go to America?"" ""Brother Wood-<br/>
ruff, would you come and preach in [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|Chel-<br/>
tenham]]?"" ""My head is in great pain, <br/>
would you heal me? "" ""I want you to <br/>
consecrate this bottle of oil before you<br/>
go?"" ""Will you write to me?"" ""I <br/>
have been waiting a long time to get a <br/>
chance to speak to you; good by, remem-<br/>
ber me to Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]], good by! God <br/>
bless you!''</p>

<p>Thus was I for more than an hour after <br/>
the close of the meeting assailed with <br/>
the affectionate outbursts and adieus and <br/>
a host of perplexities of these Saints who<br/>
crowded around me as children to their<br/>
father.</p>

<p>Many of the Saints parted from me<br/>
in tears and many followed me to <br/>
Turkey Hill where I spent the night and <br/>
they filled the house until a late hour, <br/>
begging counsel and instruction of me.<br/>
One of these was a [[Baptist|Baptist]] minister who <br/>
had just been baptized into the Church.</p>

<p>On the morrow, in company with El-<br/>
der [[John Needham|Needham]], I walked to [[Keysend Street, Berrow, Worcestershire, England|Keysend <br/>
Street]], where I preached to a crowded <br/>
congregation of Saints. On the follow-<br/>
ing day I walked to [[Wind Point, Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Wind Point]], where<br/>
I visited the Saints, and thence con-<br/>
tinued to [[Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Colwall]]. Here I met with a<br/>
large congregation of Saints and <br/>
preached to them upon the gathering.</p>

<p>Next day, with Elder [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]], I <br/>
walked over [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]] and called <br/>
upon Elder [[Samuel Jones, b. 1823|Samuel Jones]]; thence</p>",

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
through [[Great Malvern, Worcestershire, England|Great Malvern]] to [[Crowcutt, Worcestershire, England|Crowcat]]; I <br/>
held a meeting at Brother [[George Brooks|George Brooks']]<br/>
and had an interesting time with a large <br/>
number of Saints whom I had baptized <br/>
about a year before. I went to [[Dunns Close, Herefordshire, England|Dunclose]] <br/>
the day after, visiting many of the Saints<br/>
by the way, [[laying on of hands|laying hands]] upon the sick, <br/>
and blessing and counseling others of the<br/>
flock. They all were happy to see me, <br/>
for I had baptized most of them when I <br/>
first opened that field of labor. Next <br/>
day we traveled to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]], and <br/>
visited the Saints by the way.</p>

<p>At Frome's Hill I met with the Saints <br/>
on Sunday morning, and had a crowded <br/>
house; in the afternoon we held a meet-<br/>
ing at [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley Hill]], where I communed <br/>
with the church. At the close of the<br/>
meeting I had a busy time shaking hands <br/>
with the Saints and parting from them. <br/>
Many of them wished me to bless them,<br/>
and others to heal them. I spent the<br/>
night with Brother [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] at <br/>
Elder [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey's]], and on the mor-<br/>
row we held the Frome's Hill conference<br/>
at Standley Hill.</p>

<p>There were present of the traveling <br/>
high council, 2 high priests, 20 elders, <br/>
30 priests, 9 teachers, and 2 deacons.</p>

<p>After calling the meeting to order, I <br/>
moved that Elder Levi Richards should <br/>
preside over the conference, and he was<br/>
sustained by the meeting. I was chosen <br/>
clerk.</p>

<p>After singing and prayer, the presi-<br/>
dent called upon the officers for the rep-<br/>
resentation of the various branches, <br/>
which was given as follows: branches, <br/>
33; members, 957; elders, 24; priests, <br/>
68; teachers, 27; deacons, 8.</p>

<p>[[Robert Gomery|Robert Gummery]], [[Edward Phillips|Edward Philips]] and <br/>
[[John Spiers|John Spires]] were ordained to the office<br/>
of elder, under the hands of Elders <br/>
Richards, [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] and myself; [[Thomas Bishop|Thomas<br/>
Bishop]] to the office of priest, and [[William Rowley|Wm. <br/>
Rowley]] to the office of deacon.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, after speeches from<br/>
Elders Richards and Kington, I delivered <br/>
my farewell address and pronounced the<br/>
benediction on the conference.</p>

<p>After the meeting was dismissed, I was<br/>
almost three hours shaking hands with<br/>
the Saints, healing the sick and giving <br/>
counsel to the multitude who surrounded <br/>
me, many of whom were in tears when <br/>
we parted. Nearly fifty came to me to ask<br/>
me to take them to Zion, when I had not<br/>
means to take myself. I, however, gave</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
Sister [[Mary Jenkins Foxall|Foxal]] five pounds to help her and <br/>
her husband and children to the land of <br/>
America. She had made every exertion <br/>
for six months to save money to gather <br/>
with the Saints, and had raised thirty <br/>
pounds. The five pounds I gave to her<br/>
was a donation from Elder Edward <br/>
Ockey, who was imparting of his sub-<br/>
stance to help the poor of the church to<br/>
gather.</p>

<p>After bidding the multitude of Saints<br/>
farewell, I went to Elder Ockey's, to <br/>
spend the night, accompanied by Elders<br/>
Richards, Kington and [[William Kay|Ray]].</p>

<p>We had been in the house but a short <br/>
time when three of Edward Ockey's <br/>
brothers came in for the purpose of hav-<br/>
a contest, because their brother and sis-<br/>
ter had embraced the gospel and was<br/>
about to gather with the Saints. They <br/>
manifested much wrath against me, and, <br/>
after conversing with them about three <br/>
hours, they left the house, and we were<br/>
once more in peace.</p>

<p>After conversing together until the<br/>
third watch of the night, we retired to <br/>
rest, closing one of the busiest days of<br/>
my life.</p>

<p>I arose in the morning, refreshed by <br/>
sleep, and, after conversing several hours <br/>
with Elders Richards, Kington, Kay, <br/>
Ockey and others, I was under the ne-<br/>
cessity of parting with the Saints in this <br/>
region.</p>

<p>In bidding them farewell I found in <br/>
our hearts and memory of our associa-<br/>
tion many ties which bound me to those<br/>
I were leaving behind and among the<br/>
faithful ones were the Ockeys.</p>

<p>Brother Edward Ockey and his sister <br/>
[[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann]] were of a good and wealthy family. <br/>
They had many trials to pass through to <br/>
do the [[will of God|will of God]] and to gather with <br/>
the Saints, for their brothers were exceed-<br/>
ingly set against them. But Brother <br/>
Edward had maintained his integrity like<br/>
a man of God and was making every<br/>
preparation to gather with the Saints, but<br/>
his sister Ann had fears that her brothers <br/>
would hinder her gathering.</p>

<p>Having bid farewell to the Saints of <br/>
Standley Hill, I walked to Frome's Hill<br/>
and conversed with the elders until two <br/>
o'clock, when I took the parting hands <br/>
of Elders Richards, Kington, Ray and<br/>
others, and with my carpet bag with about <br/>
20 pounds weight in it, walked fifteen <br/>
miles to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] in four hours.</p>",

[[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] per stage, and was per-<br/>

<p>President [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] then made<br/>
some costed remarks upon the lawyers.</p>

<p>A brother of Dr Foster threatened the<br/>
Mayor and the Mayor fined him ten dollars.</p>

<p>President Joseph Smith's views of the<br/>
Government was then read and he was by universal<br/>
applause nominated by the Saints as a candidate for <br/>
the Presidency of the United States. An article was<br/>
read entitled a ""Voice of Inocence from Nauvoo"" and<br/>
a meeting of the ""Female Relief Society appointed to<br/>
attend to the issue of this article.</p>",

to build the [[Seventies Hall, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Hall of the Seventies]] one story higher for the Presidency.</p>

the assembly. In the course of his remarks he said</p>

<p>""I wish to speak of the duty of lawyers classing<br/>
myself with the lawyers in the House of Israel. When any man<br/>
who is a lawyer takes a course to break peace instead of making <br/>
it he is out of the way of his duty. A doctor of the law<br/>
should study the law and make peace.</p>

<p>The grand object we have before us is to build<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] this season. We have had the effects of<br/>
slander and want a cure and balm. I carry one<br/>
with me all the while and I want you to do the same<br/>
I will tell you what it is. It is to mind our own<br/>
business and let others alone and suffer wrong rather<br/>
than do wrong. If any one will take your property<br/>
away let him alone and have nothing to do with<br/>
him.</p>

<p>A spirit has been manifested to <br/>
divide the Saints. This was manifest in the last<br/>
election. It was said if they did not look out<br/>
the Saints on the flat would beat the Saints on<br/>
the hill. Great God! How such a thing<br/>
looks that the Saints should be affraid of beating<br/>
one another in the election or being beat?</p>

<p>I would ask who built up this<br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]]? Would steamboats have landed here if <br/>
the Saints had not come or could speculators<br/>
have sold their lands for anything here? If the<br/>
Saints had not come they might have sold for a<br/>
few bear and wolf skins but not for money. Can<br/>
these speculators sell all their lands to the Saints</p>",
42658.0,22,,"<p>for a great price and then go away and enjoy it somewhere<br/>
else. [[Brigham Young|I]] tell you nay for know it ye people that Israel<br/>

have gone from the head to the tail. But if any of you<br/>
wish to know how to have your bread fall butter side up<br/>
then butter it both sides and it will fall so. Uppose<br/>
this work and it will roll over you. When did this<br/>
work ever stop since it began? Never. The only<br/>
thing the Saints now want to know is what does <br/>
the Lord want of us and we are ready to do it. Well<br/>

<p><u>The Work Calling &amp; Spirit of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]] [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] &amp; Messiah</u></p>

<p>There is a difference between the spirit and<br/>
office of Elias and Elijah. It is the Spirit of Elias I <br/>
wish first to speak off. And in order to come to <br/>
the subject I will bring some of the testimony from<br/>
the Scripture and give also my own.</p>

<p>In the first place suffice it to say<br/>
that I went into the woods to inquire of the Lord by prayer<br/>
His will concerning me and I saw an angel and he<br/>
laid his hands upon my head and ordained me to be a<br/>
Priest after the order of [[Aaron (OT)|Aaron]] and to hold the keys of this<br/>
Priesthood which office was to preach repentance and baptism<br/>
for the remission of sins and also to baptize. But<br/>
I was informed that this office did not extend to the<br/>
laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and that<br/>
that office was a greater work and was to be given afterward<br/>
but that my ordination at that time was a preparatory<br/>
work or a going before which was the spirit of Elias for <br/>
the spirit of Elias was a going before to prepare the way<br/>
for the greater.</p>

<p>This was the case with [[John the Baptist (NT)|John the Baptist]].<br/>
He came crying from the wilderness ""Prepare ye the the<br/>
way of the Lord and make his paths straight and the people</p>",
42658.0,25,,"<p>were informed that if they would receive it it was the Spirit of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]].<br/>
[[John the Baptist (NT)|John]] was very particular to tell the people he was not that light<br/>
but was sent to bear witness thereof. He told them that his<br/>
mission was to preach repentance and baptism with water<br/>
but that it was he who should come after him who should<br/>
baptize with fire and the Holy Ghost. If he had been <br/>
an imposter he might have worked beyond his bounds <br/>
and undertook to have performed ordinances which did not<br/>
belong to the office and calling under the spirit of Elias.</p>

<p>The spirit of Elias is to prepare the <br/>
way for a greater revelation of God. This is the Priesthood <br/>
of Elias or the Priesthood unto which [[Aaron (OT)|Aaron]] was ordained.<br/>
And when God sends a man into the world to Prepare<br/>
for a greater work he holds the Keys of the power of<br/>
Elias. It was called the doctrine of Elias even<br/>
from the early ages of the world.</p>

<p>John's mission was limited to preaching<br/>
and baptizing but what he did was legal and when<br/>
Jesus Christ came to any of John's disciples he baptized<br/>
them with fire and the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>We find the Apostles endowed<br/>
with greater power than John. Their office was more<br/>
under the Spirit and power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] than of Elias.<br/>
In the case of [[Philip (NT)|Philip]] when he went down to [[Samaria, Palestine|Samaria]]<br/>
under the Spirit of Elias he baptized both men and <br/>
women but when [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] and [[John (NT)|John]] heard of it they went<br/>
down and laid their hands on them and they received<br/>
the Holy Ghost. This shows the distinction between<br/>
the two powers. When [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] came to certain disciples<br/>
he asked if they had received the Holy Ghost. They<br/>
answered, ""No."" ""Who baptized you then?""<br/>
""We were baptized unto John's baptism."" ""No John<br/>
did not baptize your for he did his work right.""</p>",
42658.0,26,,"<p>So [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] baptized them over again for he knew what the true<br/>
doctrine was and he knew that [[John the Baptist (NT)|John]] had not baptized them<br/>
and it is strange to me that men who have read the Scrip[tures]<br/>
of the New Testament are so far from these principles.</p>

<p>What [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] want to impress upon your<br/>
mind is the difference of power in different parts of the<br/>
Priesthood so that when any man comes among you saying<br/>
I have the Spirit of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]] you may know whether he be<br/>
true or false for any man coming having the spirit <br/>
and power of Elias will not transcend his bounds. John<br/>
did not transcend his bounds but faithfully performed<br/>
that part belonging to his office. And every portion of<br/>
the great building should be prepared rightly and assigned <br/>
to its proper place.</p>

<p>It is necessary to know who holds<br/>
the Keys of power and who do not or we may be likely<br/>
to be deceived. That person who holds the keys of <br/>
Elias has a preparatory work. But if I spend <br/>
much more time in conversing about the spirit of<br/>
Elias I shall not have time to do justice to the spirit<br/>
and power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] who is the Elias spoken of in the<br/>
last days. And here is the rock upon which many<br/>
split thinking the time was past in the days of<br/>
Jesus Christ and no more to be; but the spirit of <br/>
Elias was revealed to me and I know it is true therefor[e]<br/>
I speak with boldness for I know verily my doctrine<br/>
is true.</p>

<p>Now for Elijah. The spirit power <br/>
and calling of Elijah is that we have power to hold <br/>
the keys of the revelations ordinances oracles and endowm[ents]<br/>
of the fulness of the Melchezedec Priesthood and of<br/>
the Kingdom of God on the earth and to receive and<br/>
perform all the ordinances of the Kingdom of God</p>",
42658.0,27,,"<p>even to the sealing of the hearts of the fathers unto the children and<br/>
the hearts of the children unto the fathers even those who are <br/>
in heaven.</p>

<p>[[Malachi (OT)|Malachi]] says, ""I will send [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]]<br/>
before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come and He<br/>
shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children and the hearts<br/>
of the children to the Fathers lest I come and smite the earth<br/>
with a curse.</p>

<p>Now what [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] am after is the knowledge<br/>
of God and I take my own course to obtain it. What<br/>
are we to understand by this ^the mission of Elijah^ in the last days. In the<br/>
days of [[Noah (OT)|Noah]] God destroyed the world by a flood and<br/>
he has promised to destroy it by fire in the last<br/>
days. But before it takes place Elijah shall first <br/>
come and turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children &amp;c<br/>
Now comes the point. What is the office and work <br/>
of Elijah? and this is one of the most important subjects<br/>
that God has revealed.</p>

<p>He shall send Elijah to seal the<br/>
fathers to the children and the children to the fathers!<br/>
Now was this merely confined to the living to settle<br/>
difficulties with families on earth? By no means.<br/>
It was a far greater work. Elijah, What would <br/>
you do were you here? Would you confine your <br/>
work to the living alone. No. I would refer you<br/>
to the Scripture where the subject is manifest.<br/>
""Without us they cannot be made perfect nor we without <br/>
them."" the fathers without the children nor the children without the fathers.</p>

<p>I wish you to understand this subject <br/>
for it is important and if you will receive it this is the<br/>
spirit of Elijah that we redeem our dead and connect<br/>
ourselves with our fathers who are in heaven and seal<br/>
up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection</p>",
42658.0,28,,"<p>And here we want the power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] to seal those who<br/>
dwell on the earth to those who dwell in heaven. This is<br/>
the power of Elijah and the keys of the Kingdom of Jehovah.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a case. Suppose the<br/>
great God who dwells in the heavens should reveal himself<br/>
to Father [[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]] here and tell him I offer up a decree<br/>
that whatsoever you seal on earth with your decree will I<br/>
seal in heaven. You have power then? Can it be<br/>
taken off? No. Then what you seal on earth by <br/>
the <strike>power</strike> ^keys^ of Elijah is sealed in heaven and this is<br/>
the power of Elijah and herein is the difference between<br/>
the ^spirit and^ power of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]] and Elijah for while the spirit of<br/>
Elias is a forerunner the power of Elijah is sufficient<br/>
to make our calling and election sure; and it is<br/>
the same doctrine where we are exhorted to go on<br/>
unto perfection not laying again the foundation of <br/>
repentance from dead works but of laying on of hands<br/>
the resurrection of the dead &amp;c. We cannot be perfect<br/>
without the Fathers &amp;c. We must have revelation<br/>
then and we can see that the doctrine of revelation as<br/>
far transcends the doctrine of no revelation at all as<br/>
knowledge is above ignorance for one truth revalled<br/>
from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in existance</p>

<p>This spirit of Elijah was manifest<br/>
in the days of the Apostles in delivering certain ones<br/>
over to the buffettings of Satan that they may be<br/>
saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. They were<br/>
sealed by the spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of <br/>
hell until the day of the Lord or revelation of<br/>
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Here is the doctrine of election that<br/>
the world have quarrelled so much about but they<br/>
do not know anything concerning it. The doctrine</p>",
42658.0,29,,"<p>that the Pr<strike>e</strike>ysbeterians and Methodists have quarreled so much about<br/>
namely once in grace always in grace and on the other side the<br/>
falling away from grace [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will say a word about. They are<br/>
both wrong. Truth takes the road between. The Prysbeterian<br/>
says once in grace you cannot fall. The Methodist says<br/>
you can have grace to day fall from it to-morrow next<br/>
day have grace again and so follow it on. But the <br/>
doctrine of the Scriptures and the spirit of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] would<br/>
show them both false and take the road between.<br/>
According to the Scriptures if a man has received the good<br/>
word of God and tasted of the powers of the world to come<br/>
if he shall fall away it is impossible to renew him<br/>
again seeing that he has crucified the Son of God<br/>
afresh and put him to an open shame</p>

<p>So there is a possibility of falling<br/>
^away^ yet could not be renewed again and the power of Elijah cannot<br/>
seal against this sin for this is a reserve made in the<br/>
seals and power of the Priesthood.</p>

<p>I will make every doctrine plain<br/>
that I present and it shall stand upon a firm basis<br/>
and I am at the defiance of the world for I will take<br/>
shelter under the broad cover of the wings of the work<br/>
in which I am engaged. It matters not to me if all <br/>
hell boils over. I regard it only as I would the crackling of<br/>
the thorns under the pot</p>

<p>A murderer for instance—one<br/>
who has shed inocent blood cannot have forgiveness<br/>
[[David (OT)|David]] sought repentance at the hand of God carefully<br/>
with tears; but he could only get it through hell. He<br/>
obtained a promise that his soul should not be left in <br/>
hell. Although David was king he never did obtain <br/>
the Spirit and Power of Elijah and the fulness of<br/>
the Priesthood and the priesthood that he received and</p>",
42658.0,30,,"<p>and the throne and kingdom of [[David (OT)|David]] are to be taken from<br/>
him and given to another by the name of David in<br/>
the last days raised up out of his lineage.</p>

<p>[[Peter (NT)|Peter]] refered to the same subject<br/>
on the day of Penticost but the multitude did not get<br/>
the endowment which Peter had; but several days after<br/>
the people asked ""what shall we do?"" Speaking of their<br/>
crucifying the Lord Peter said ""I wot that through ignorance<br/>
ye did it as did also your rulers"" He did not say to<br/>
them repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins<br/>
but he said ""Repent ye therefore and be converted that your<br/>
sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing<br/>
shall come from the presence of the Lord."" This is the<br/>
case with murderers. They could not be baptized for <br/>
the remission of sins for they had shed inocent blood</p>

<p>Again to the doctrine of the sealing<br/>
power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]]. <strike>is that</strike> If you have power to seal on earth<br/>
and in heaven then you should be wise. The first thing<br/>
you do go and seal on earth your sons and daughters unto<br/>
yourself and yourself unto your fathers in eternal glory<br/>
and go ahead and not go back. Use a little craftiness<br/>
and seal all you can and when you get to heaven tell<br/>
your father ^that^ what you sealed on earth should be sealed in<br/>
heaven. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will walk through the gate of heaven and<br/>
claim what I seal and those that follow me and my<br/>
counsel.</p>

<p>The Lord once told me that what I asked<br/>
for I should have. I have been afraid to ask God to<br/>
kill my enemies lest some of them should peradventure<br/>
repent. I asked a short time since for the Lord to<br/>
deliver me out of the hands of the [[Thomas Reynolds|Governor]] of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
and if needs be to accomplish it to take him away<br/>
and the next news which came pouring down from</p>",
42658.0,31,,"<p>there was that Governor [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] had shot himself</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] would now say Beware O Earth how you<br/>
fight against the Saints and shed inocent blood for in the days<br/>
of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] when his enemies came upon him fire ^was^ called down from<br/>
heaven and destroyed them</p>

<p>The Spirit of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]] is first Elijah second<br/>
and Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way<br/>
and the spirit and power of Elijah is to come after holding the<br/>
keys of power, building the Temple to the cap-stone, placing<br/>
the seals of the Melchezedec Priesthood upon the house of<br/>
Israel and making all things ready. Then Messiah<br/>
comes to his Temple which is last of all</p>

<p>Messiah is above the spirit and power <br/>
of Elijah for he made the world and was that spiritual<br/>
rock unto [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] in the wilderness. Elijah was to come<br/>
and prepare the way and build up the kingdom before the <br/>
coming of the great day of the Lord though the spirit of<br/>
Elias was to begin it.</p>

<p>I have asked the Lord concerning his<br/>
coming and while asking the Lord gave me a sign and<br/>
said ""In the days of [[Noah (OT)|Noah]] I set a bow in the heavens as<br/>
a sign and token. In any year that the bow shall be<br/>
seen the Lord will not come but there shall be sead time<br/>
and harvest during that year. But whenever you see the<br/>
bow withdraw it shall be a token that there shall be<br/>
famine pestelence and great distress among the nations</p>

<p>But I will take the responsibility upon <br/>
myself to prophesy in the name of the Lord that Christ<br/>
will not come as Miller has prophesied for we have seen<br/>
the bow and I also prophesy in the name of the Lord that<br/>
<u>Christ</u> <u>will</u> <u>not</u> <u>come</u> <u>in</u> <u>forty</u> <u>years</u> and if ever the Lord <br/>
spake by my mouth he will not come in that time<br/>
Jesus never did reveal to any man the precise time</p>",
42658.0,32,,"<p>that he would come. Go and read the scriptures and you<br/>
cannot find any part which specifies the exact time of his<br/>
coming and all who say so are false teachers. There are <br/>
some important things concerning the office of the Messiah<br/>
in the organization of the <strike>kingdom of God</strike> ^world^ of which [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] <br/>
will speak hereafter.""</p>

<p>[FIGURE]</p>

<p>The Sunday <strike>fortnight</strike> ^two weeks^ when I arrived at<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] Joseph was speaking. He said</p>

<p>""I have been informed by two gentlemen<br/>
that a conspiracy is got up in this place for the purpose<br/>
of taking the life of President Joseph Smith his family<br/>
and all the Smith family and also the heads of the<br/>
Church. One of the gentlemen will give his name<br/>
to the public and the other wishes it to be hid for<br/>
the present. They will both testify to it on oath<br/>
and make an affadavit upon it. The names of the <br/>
persons revealled at the head of the conspiracy are [[Chauncy Lawson Higbee|Chaucy<br/>
Higby]] Dr [[Charles Ambrose Foster|Foster]] Mr [[Joseph H. Jackson|Jackson]] and [[William Law|William]] and [[Wilson Law|Wilson Law]]<br/>
And the lies which Highby has hatched up as a foundation<br/>
is—he says that I had mens heads cut off in [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
and that I had a sword run through the hearts of the<br/>
people whom I wanted to kill and out of the way.</p>

<p>I wont sware out a warrant against<br/>
them for I do not fear any of them. They would not scare <br/>
off an old setting hen. I intend to publish all the iniquity<br/>
that I know of them. If I am guilty I am ready to<br/>
bear it. There is honour among enemies. I am<br/>
willing to do anything for the good of the people. I<br/>
will give the name of one of the gentlemen who have<br/>
devulged the plot. His name is [[Merinus G. Eaton|Eaton]]. He will<br/>
sware to it. He is a bold fellow. Jackson said</p>",
42658.0,33,,"<p>a Smith should not be alive two weeks not over two months anyhow<br/>
As concerning the character of these men [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will say nothing about it<br/>
now but if I hear any more from them upon this subject I will tell<br/>
all I know about them""</p>

<p>[[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] and [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] followed with<br/>
addresses to the Assembly and then Joseph again arose and<br/>
remarked upon a point of Sidney's discourse. He said</p>

<p>In relation to the power <strike>of</strike> ^over^ the minds<br/>
of mankind which I hold I would say it is in consequence<br/>
of the power ^of truth^ in the doctrines which I have been an instru-<br/>
ment in the hands of God of presenting unto them and<br/>
not because of any compusion on my part. I will ask<br/>
if I ever got any of it unfair?—if I have not reproved you <br/>
in the gate? I ask did I ever exercise compulsion over<br/>
any man? Did I not give him the liberty of disbelieving<br/>
any doctrine I preached if he saw fit? Why do not<br/>
my enemies strike a blow at my doctrine? They<br/>
cannot do it. It is truth; and I am as the voice<br/>
of one crying in the wilderness. ""Repent of your sins<br/>
and prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man<br/>
for the Kingdom of God has come unto you and <br/>
hence forth the axe is laid unto the root of the tree<br/>
and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit God<br/>
Almighty (and not Jo Smith) shall hew down <br/>
and cast into the fire""</p>

<p>Twelve days later I attended the<br/>
dedication of the [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo Masonic Lodge]]. This was<br/>
the first Masonic dedication I ever attended. The <br/>
procession was composed of about five hundred members<br/>
and the whole was grand and imposing</p>

<p>In the fore part of the day President<br/>
Joseph Smith was to have preached the funeral sermon</p>",
42658.0,34,,""">7th</time> in the afternoon the Prophet Joseph <br/>
delivered one of the most important discourses of his<br/>
life to about <strike>ten</strike> ^twenty^ thousand souls upon the subject <br/>
of the death of King Follet.</p>",
42658.0,35,,"<p><u>Joseph's Great Discourse</u><br/>
(<u>recorded</u> <u>in</u> <u>my</u> <u>Journal</u>)</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] now call the attention of this congregation<br/>
while I address you upon the subject of the dead.</p>

<p>The case of our beloved brother [[King Follett|King<br/>
Follet]] who was crushed to death in a well, as also many<br/>
others who have lost friends will be had in mind this afternoon<br/>
and I shall speak upon the subject in general as far as I<br/>
shall be inspired by the Holy Spirit to treat upon it</p>

<p>I want the prayers and faith of the <br/>
Saints that I might have the Holy Ghost so that the<br/>
testimony may carry conviction to your minds of the<br/>
truth of what I shall say and I pray that the Lord<br/>
may strengthen my lungs. There is strength here and<br/>
your prayers will be heard.</p>

<p>Before I enter upon an investigation <br/>
of this subject I wish to pave the way and bring up<br/>
the subject from the beginning that you may understand<br/>
I do not intend to please you with oratory but with the<br/>
simple truths of heaven to edify you.</p>

<p>Go to the morn of Creation to understand<br/>
the decrees of Eloheim at the creation. It is necessary<br/>
that we have an understanding of God at the beginning.<br/>
If we get a good start at first we can go right but if<br/>
you start wrong you may go wrong</p>

<p>But few understand the character<br/>
of God. They do not know Him they do not <br/>
understand their relationship to Him. The world know<br/>
no more than the brute beast. They know no more<br/>
than to eat drink and sleep. This is all man knows<br/>
about God or His existance ^except^ what is given by the inspiration</p>",
42658.0,36,,"<p>of the Almighty.</p>

<p>Go then to the beginning that you may<br/>
understand. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] ask this congregation what kind of a<br/>
being is God? Turn your thoughts in your own<br/>
hearts and say have any of you seen or heard Him<br/>
or communed with Him. This is a question which<br/>
may occupy your attention. The scriptures informs us<br/>
that this is eternal life to know thee the only true and<br/>
living God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. If<br/>
any enquire What kind of a being God is I would say<br/>
if you do not know Him you have not eternal life<br/>
Go back and find out what kind of a being God is.<br/>
If I am the man that shows you what kind of being <br/>
God is then let every man and woman sit in silence<br/>
and never lift up the hand against me again. If I<br/>
do not this I will make no more pretentions to<br/>
inspiration or to be a Prophet. I should be like the<br/>
rest of the world a false teacher and you would want<br/>
to take my life. But you might just as well<br/>
take the lives of other false teachers as mine if I<br/>
was false. But meddle not with any man for his<br/>
religion. Every Government ought to <strike>protect</strike> ^permit^ every man<br/>
to enjoy his religion</p>

<p>I will show the world is wrong by<br/>
showing what God is. I am going to enquire<br/>
after Him so that you may know God that persecution<br/>
may cease concerning me. I will go back to the<br/>
beginning to show what kind of a being God was. I<br/>
will tell you and hear it O Earth! <u>God</u> <u>who</u> <u>sits</u> <u>in</u><br/>
<u>Yonder</u> <u>heavens</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>man</u> <u>like</u> <u>unto</u> <u>yourselves</u>.<br/>
That God if you were to see Him to day who holds<br/>
the worlds you would see Him like a man in form<br/>
like yourselves. [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] was made in His</p>",
42658.0,37,,"<p>image and talked and walked with Him</p>

<p>In order to understand the dead for the<br/>
consolation of those who mourn [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] want you to understand God and<br/>
how he came to be God. We have supposed that God was God <br/>
from eternity. I will refute that idea or I will take away<br/>
the veil so that you may see. It is one of the first principles<br/>
to know that we may converse with Him. He was once a<br/>
man like unto us and the Father was once on an earth<br/>
like us, and I wish I was in a suitabll place to tell it</p>

<p>The scriptures inform us, mark it, that<br/>
Jesus Christ said ""As the Father hath power in Himself so<br/>
hath the Son power in Himself."" <strike>S</strike>To do what? That Father did even<br/>
to lay down <strike>my</strike> ^his^ body and take it up again. Do you believe<br/>
it? If not you do not believe the Bible. I will defy all hell and<br/>
earth to refute this. And you have got to learn how to become<br/>
<strike>yourself</strike> ^a^ God king and priest by going from a small capacity<br/>
to a great capacity, to the resurrection of the dead and to<br/>
dwelling in everlasting burning. I want you to learn the<br/>
first principle of this order</p>

<p>How consoling to the mourners when<br/>
they part with their friends to know that though they lay down<br/>
this body it will rise and dwell in everlasting burning<br/>
to be an heir of God and joint heir with Jesus Christ<br/>
enjoying the same exaltation and glory until you arrive at<br/>
the station of a God</p>

<p>What did Jesus Christ do? ""The<br/>
same as I see the Father do."" See the Father do what?<br/>
""Work out a kingdom. When I have done so too I will<br/>
give it up to the Father which will add to His glory<br/>
He will then take a higher exaltation and I shall <br/>
take His place and be also exalted""</p>

<p>These are the first principles of <br/>
the Gospel. It will take a long time after the</p>",
42658.0,38,,"<p>grave to understand the whole</p>

<p>If [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] should say anything but what was in<br/>
the Bible the cry of treason would be heard. I will then<br/>
go to the Bible and will make a comment on the very<br/>
first sentence of the history of the Creation—<u>Berosheit</u>. I want<br/>
to analize the word; baith, in, by, through and everything<br/>
else. <u>Rosh</u>, the head; <u>sheit</u>, gramatical termination<br/>
When the inspired man wrote it he did not put the <u>baith</u><br/>
there; an old Jew without any authority added the word: he<br/>
thought it too bad to begin to talk about the head. It reat at <br/>
first ""The head one of the Gods brought forth the Gods"": that is<br/>
the true meaning of the words. <u>Baurau</u> signifies to<br/>
bring forth. If you do not believe it you do not <br/>
believe the learned man of God. Learned men can<br/>
teach you no more than what I have told you. Thus <br/>
the head God brought forth the Gods in the Grand Council<br/>
I will transpose it in the English language. I want you to<br/>
know and learn that the Holy Ghost knows something.<br/>
The Grand Council sat at the head and contemplated the<br/>
Creation of the world. Some will say the scriptures<br/>
^say^ so and so; but I will show you a test out of an old<br/>
edition of the New Testament in the Hebrew Latin<br/>
German and Greek languages. In the 21 verse of the<br/>
fourth ch. of Mathew our common translation says<br/>
[[James (NT)|James]] the Son of Zebedee but this old book in my<br/>
possession says Jacob the Son of Zebedee in each of the<br/>
four languages—the Hebrew Latin German and Greek<br/>
The doctors (I mean the doctors of the law) say if you<br/>
preach anything not according to the Bible we will cry<br/>
treason; but if ye are not led by revelation How can ye <br/>
escape the damnation of hell. Here we have the testimony<br/>
of four against one—the present translation. I have the oldest<br/>
book in the world and the Holy Ghost besides. I thank God<br/>
for the old book but more for the Holy Ghost.</p>",
42658.0,39,,"<p>In the beginning the head of the Gods called a council of<br/>
the Gods and they came together and concocted a plan to create the world and people<br/>
it. Having a knowledge of God and what kind of a being he is we know <br/>
how to approach him and how to ask so as to receive an answer.</p>

<p>Another thing, the learned say the Lord made the world out of nothing and they account it <br/>
blasphemy in any one to contradict their idea. If you tell them God made the<br/>
world out of something they will account you a fool. But I am more learned in the<br/>
things of God than they and know more than all the world put together: the Holy Ghost does<br/>
anyhow and he is within [[Joseph Smith Jr.|me]] and comprehends more than all the world and I will<br/>
associate myself with him; They infer from the word create that the world must<br/>
have been made out of nothing. Now the word create came from the word <u>Baurau</u><br/>
and does not mean to create out of nothing but to organize the same as a man would o[r]ganize<br/>
materials to build a ship. Element had an existance, from the time God had. It can be organized<br/>
and reorganized but not destroyed. I have another subject to speak upon calculated to exalt man<br/>
It is associated with the subject of the ressurection of the dead--namely, the soul<br/>
the mind of man, the immortal spirit, where did it come<br/>
from? The learned say God made it in the beginning<br/>
But it is not so. I know better. God has told me<br/>
If you do not believe it that will not make the truth<br/>
without effect. God was a self-existing being. Man<br/>
exists upon the same principle. God made a tabernacle<br/>
and put the spirit into it and man became a human<br/>
soul. Man existed in spirit and mind co-equal<br/>
with God Himself</p>

<p>You who mourn the loss of friends<br/>
are only seperated from them but for a moment.<br/>
The spirit is seperated for a little time but they are <br/>
conversant with each other as we are on earth. I am<br/>
dwelling on the immutibility of the spirit of man<br/>
Is it logic to say the Spirit of man had a beginning<br/>
and yet has no end? It does not have either a<br/>
beginning or end. My ring is like the existance<br/>
of the soul of man. It has no beginning or end. If<br/>
it were cut in two there would be both a beginning<br/>
and an end. So with man. If he had a beginning <br/>
he would also have an end.</p>

<p>If I am right I might say God never<br/>
had power to create the Spirit of man. God Himself<br/>
could not create himself. Intelligence is eternal</p>",
42658.0,40,,"<p>and it is self-existing. All mind is succeptible of improvement<br/>
The relationship we sustain with God places us in a situation<br/>
to advance in knowledge. God has power to institute laws<br/>
to instructe the lesser intelligences that they may be exalted<br/>
with Himself. This is good doctrine. It tastes good<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] can taste the principles of eternal life. So can you<br/>
They are given to me by the revelations of Jesus Christ<br/>
and I know you believe it. All that which God<br/>
sees fit to reveal in relation to us makes known his<br/>
will to our spirits precisely as though we had no bodies<br/>
at all and those revelations which will save our spirits will<br/>
also save our bodies: hence the awful responsibility which rests<br/>
upon us in relation to our dead for all the spirits who have not<br/>
obeyed the Gospel in the flesh must obey it in the spirit or be<br/>
damned. Would to God I had forty days and nights in which<br/>
to tell you all; I would let you know that I am not<br/>
'a fallen Prophet.'</p>

<p>The greatest responsibility laid upon us in this<br/>
life is to seek after our dead. The Apostle says they<br/>
without us cannot be made perfect for it is necessary that<br/>
the sealing powers should be in our hands to seal our children<br/>
and our dead for the fulness of the dispensation of times --<br/>
a dispensation to meet the promises made by Jesus Christ<br/>
before the foundation of the world for the salvation of man<br/>
It is necessary that those who are gone before and those who come<br/>
after us should have Salvation in common with us and thus<br/>
has God made it obligatory upon man. Hence He has said<br/>
I will send [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] the Prophet to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children</p>

<p>From before the foundation of the world God hath<br/>
made provisions to suit the conditions of man. Jesus said, ""All<br/>
sins and blasphemy except the sin against the Holy Ghost should<br/>
be forgiven and there is a salvation for all either in this<br/>
world or the world to come who have not committed the unpardonable</p>",
42658.0,41,,"<p>sin. God has made provision that every spirit in the eternal world can be<br/>
saved unless he has committed this sin and the spirits of our friends<br/>
can be searched out and saved. Any man who has a friend in eternity<br/>
can save him if he has not committed the unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>A man cannot commit the unpardonable sin after the<br/>
dissolution of the body and there is a possibility of his escape. If a<br/>
man has knowledge he can be saved. If he has been guilty<br/>
of great sins he is punished for them. When he consents to<br/>
obey the Gospel whether alive or dead he is saved.</p>

<p>A man's own mind damns him. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]]<br/>
have no fear of hell fire. It does not exist. The torment<br/>
of disapointment in the mind of man is as a lake burning<br/>
with fire and brimstone. <strike>I</strike></p>

<p>No man can commit the unpardonable<br/>
sin until he receives the Holy Ghost and then it must be<br/>
done in this world and cannot be committed after the<br/>
dissolution of the body. Hence the salvation of Jesus <br/>
Christ wrought for all men triumphs over the devil<br/>
for even he stood up as a Saviour. All <strike>who</strike> ^must^ suffer until<br/>
they obey Christ himself.</p>

<p>The contention in heaven was--Jesus said<br/>
there would be souls who would not be saved and the Devil<br/>
said he could save them all and laid his plans before the<br/>
grand Council who gave their vote in favour of Jesus Christ<br/>
So the devil rose up in rebellion against god and was cast<br/>
down with all who put up their hands for him.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ will save all except the sons <br/>
of Perdition. What must a man do to commit the <strike>unpar-</strike><br/>
unpardonable sin. He must receive<strike>d</strike> the Holy Ghost have<br/>
the heavens opened to him and know God and then sin<br/>
against <u>Him</u>. After a man has sinned against the<br/>
Holy Ghost there is no repentance for him. He has got to<br/>
say the sun does not shine while he sees it; he has got to</p>",
42658.0,42,,"<p>to deny Jesus Christ when the heavens have been opened to him and<br/>
to deny the plan of Salvation with his eyes open to the truth and from <br/>
that time he begins to be an enemy. This is the case with many apostates<br/>
of the Church. They never cease to try to hurt me and thirst for my<br/>
blood; they have the Spirit of the devil which crucified the Lord of<br/>
Life--the same that sins against the Holy Ghost. You cannot<br/>
save them. They make open war like the Devil.</p>

<p>If a spirit of bitterness is in you dont be in haste. You may say <br/>
that man is a sinner. Well if he repents he shall be forgiven. Be<br/>
cautious. When you find a spirit that wants murder the same<br/>
is of the devil.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] could go back and trace every subject of interest concerning the<br/>
relationship of man to God if I had time and enter largely into the<br/>
eternal worlds. Jesus says there are many mansions in my Fathers<br/>
Kingdom and [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] says there is one glory of the Sun another of the Moon<br/>
another of the Stars for one Star differeth from another star in glory<br/>
So also is the resurrection of the dead. What have we to console us in<br/>
relation to our dead? The greatest hope of any people on earth. We <br/>
have seen them walk worthily in our midst and <strike>sink</strike> ^fall^ asteep [asleep] in<br/>
the arms of Jesus and those who have died in the faith are now<br/>
in the celestial Kingdom of God. They have gone to await the resurrection<br/>
of the dead to go into celestial glory while there are many who will<br/>
have to wait myri[a]ds of years before they can receive the like<br/>
blessings. I am authorized to say to you by the authority of the <br/>
Holy Ghost that you have no occasion to fear. You may wait for<br/>
your friends to meet you in the morn of the celestial world.<br/>
Those who have been murdered in the persecution shall triumph gloriously<br/>
in the celestial world while their murder<strike>s</strike>ers shall dwell in torment for<br/>
ages until they have paid the uttermost farthing</p>

<p>I have a father brothers chrildren and friends who ^have^ gone <strike>f</strike>to a <br/>
world of spirits. They are only absent for a moment, and we shall soon meet<br/>
again. The time will soon arrive when the trumphet shall sound. When we<br/>
depart we shall hail our mothers, fathers, friends and all whom we love who<br/>
have fallen asleep in Jesus. There will be no fear of mobs &amp;c. It will be an<br/>
eternity of felicity. [FIGURE]</p>

<p>A question may be asked will mothers have their<br/>
children in eternity. Yes yes mothers. You shall have your children</p>",
42658.0,43,,"<p>for they shall have eternal life; for their debt is paid. There is no damnation awaiting<br/>
them. They are in the Spirit. But as the child dies so shall it rise from the dead and<br/>
be forever living in the learning of God. It will never grow. It will still be the child<br/>
in the same precise form as it appeared before it died out of its mothers<br/>
arms but possessing all the intelligence of a God. Children dwell in the mansions of<br/>
glory and exe<strike>cr</strike>rcise power but appear in the same form as when on earth. Eternity<br/>
is full of thrones upon which dwell thousands of children regning on thrones of<br/>
glory with not one cubit added to their stature.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will leave this subject here and make a few remarks<br/>
upon the subject of baptism. The baptism of water without the baptism of<br/>
fire and the Holy Ghost is of no use. They are inseperably connected. An<br/>
individual must be born of water and the spirit in order to enter the Kingdom<br/>
of God. In German the text bears me out the same as the revelations which<br/>
I have given and taught for the last fourteen years on that subject. You<br/>
will find it in the declaration of [Baptist, John the (NT)|[John the Baptist]].   -[<u>reads from the German</u>]-<br/>
John says ""I baptize you with water, but when Jesus comes who has the<br/>
power (or keys) he shall administer the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost""</p>

<p>There is one God one Father one Jesus one hope of our calling one<br/>
baptism. All these three baptisms only make one. Many talk of baptism<br/>
not being essential to salvation; but this kind of teaching would lay the<br/>
foundation of their damnation. I have the truth and am at the<br/>
defiance of the world to contradict me if they can</p>

<p>Hear it all ye ends of the earth—all ye Priests—all ye sinners<br/>
and all men,—Repent, repent! obey the Gospel; turn to God for your<br/>
religion wont save you, and you will be damned: I do not say how long.<br/>
There have been remarks made concerning all men being redeemed from hell<br/>
but I say that those who sin against the Holy Ghost cannot be forgiven<br/>
in this world or the world to come. They shall die the second death. Those <br/>
who commit the unpardonable sin are doomed to <u>Gnolom</u>, to dwell in<br/>
hell worlds without end. As they concoct scenes of bloodshed in this world so<br/>
they shall rise to that resurrection which is as the lake of fire and brimstone<br/>
Some shall rise to the everlasting burning of God, for God dwells in everlasting<br/>
burnings and some shall rise to the damnation of their own filthiness<br/>
which is as exquisite a torment as the lake of fire and brimstone</p>

<p>I have no enmity against any man. I love you all but<br/>
I hate some of your deeds. I am your best friend and if persons miss<br/>
their mark it is their own fault. If I reprove a man and he hates me<br/>
he is a fool for I love all men especially these my brethren and sisters</p>

<p>I rejoice to hear the testimony of some of my aged<br/>
friends. You dont know me. You never knew my heart. No<br/>
man knows my history. I cannot tell it. I shall never<br/>
undertake it. I dont blame anyone for not believing my <br/>
history. If I had not experienced what I have I could not<br/>
have believed it myself. I never did harm any man since<br/>
I was born into the world. My voice is always for peace.</p>

<p><u>I cannot lie</u> <u>down until</u> <u>all my work is finished.</u><br/>
I never think any evil nor do anything to the harm of my fellow<br/>
man. When I am called by the trumph of the archangel<br/>
and weighed in the balance you will all know me then.</p>

<p>I add no more God bless you all. Amen</p>",

when [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] arose and said it was impossible for him to<br/>
continue the subject of the previous day in consequence of the<br/>
weakness of his lungs. But among his brief remarks was<br/>
one of the most important revelations of the age. He said</p>

<p>Yet I have</p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Great</u> <u>Proclamation</u></p>

<p>It is in relation to Zion and a proclamation for the<br/>
Elders to teach the Church hereafter. The whole of <br/>
[[South America|South]] &amp; [[North America|North America]] is Zion and the mountain of the<br/>
Lord's house is in the centre of North and South America<br/>
When the House is done the baptismal font erected<br/>
and finished and the worthy are washed anointed endowed &amp;<br/>
^ordained^ kings and priests which must be done in this life --<br/>
and when the place is prepared you must also go through<br/>
all the ordinances of the house of the Lord and if<br/>
you have any dead relations for them also the same<br/>
as for yourselves -- then the Elders are to go through all<br/>
America and build up Churches until all Zion is built<br/>
up. But this is not to commence until this [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] <br/>
is built and the Elders are endowed. Then go forth<br/>
and accomplish the work and build up stakes in<br/>
all North and South America. There will be some<br/>
place ordained for the redeeming of the dead. I think<br/>
this will be the one.""</p>

<p>He also remarked that this proclamation<br/>
was the greatest ever made to us as all could not<br/>
come here but it was necessary that enough should<br/>
come to build up the Temple and get an endowment so<br/>
that the work could spread abroad</p>

<p>Joseph's lungs failed him and he called<br/>
upon [[George Washington Joshua Adams|George J. Adams]] to occupy the forenoon</p>",

affairs and parted from my wife and children for the<br/>

one it had been my lot to be in the vineyard every<br/>

<p>This was the last mission ever [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
the Prophet gave to the Twelve Apostles of this dispensation<br/>
He wished none of us to remain with the exception of [[Willard Richards|Willard<br/>
Richards]]. He told [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] he wanted hi<strike>s</strike>m to<br/>
go especially on this mission with his quorum and he<br/>
spoke with much earnestness. He also turned to me<br/>
and said brother Woodruff I want you to go and if<br/>
you do not you will die. It rested with weight upon <br/>
my mind at the time he spoke and I have often thought<br/>
since when musing over the awful catastrophy of his &amp; [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrums]]<br/>
martyrdom how true his words might have been had I<br/>
remained. Elder Taylor did remain and he and Willard<br/>
Richards <u>the only ones of the Twelve left in Nauvoo where</u><br/>
with him in prison at his assassination. Had more<br/>
of us been there with him in Nauvoo we might some<br/>
of us have met the death which Elder John Taylor<br/>
but barely escaped. <strike>having received</strike></p>

<p>It might have been that Willard Richards who was the<br/>
only one whom Joseph wished to stay with him of the<br/>
Twelve was also the only one of us who could stay with<br/>
him <strike>unhurt</strike> ^safely^ and he passed through that awful scene <br/>
of the martyrdom of our Prophet and Patriarch safe<br/>
from personal harm.</p>

<p>I took the parting hand of Joseph<br/>
and Hyrum at their own dwelling. Joseph was<br/>
standing in his own entery when I took his hand to<br/>
bid him farewell. Brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] was with<br/>
me. As he took me by the hand he said<br/>

the loss of the Prophet and Patriarch yet through our meeting<br/>
they were strengthened in the faith and the comfort of the<br/>

I had a vision at [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] June the 27th. This was presented<br/>
to my mind not as an open vision but rather a continuation<br/>
of the vision mentioned in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants</p>

<p>It was shown to me that this Church must<br/>
be built up to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and that all the blessings we receive<br/>
must come through him. I have been ordained a Spokesman<br/>
to Joseph and I must come to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and see that the<br/>
Church is goverened in a proper manner. Joseph sustains the<br/>
same relationship to this Church as he has always done. No<br/>
man can be the succcessor of Joseph</p>

<p>The kingdom is to be built up to Jesus Christ<br/>
through Joseph. There must be revelation still. The<br/>
martyred Prophet is still the head of this Church. Every quorum <br/>
should stand as you stood in your washings and consecrations<br/>
I have been consecrated a spokesman to Joseph and I<br/>
was commanded to speak for him. The Church is not disorganized<br/>
though our head is gone</p>

<p>We may have a diversity of feelings<br/>
on this matter. I have been called to be a spokesman unto<br/>
Joseph and I want to build up the Church unto him and<br/>
if the people want me to sustain this place I want it upon<br/>
the principle that every individual shall acknowledge it for<br/>
himself.</p>

commanded me and the people can please themselves<br/>

will seek the lives of the Twelve as they did the lives of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>

of the Priesthood so that if we are killed the fulness of the <br/>

keys and powers belonging to the Apostleship which he<br/>
himself held before he was taken away and no man or<br/>

Richards]] Wilford Woodruff and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
The several quorums were organized on and around the <br/>
stand according to order.</p>

<p>The meeting being opened President<br/>
Brigham Young arose and said, <u>Attention</u> <u>all</u>!<br/>
This congregation makes me think of the days of king <br/>
[[Benjamin (BofM)|Benjamin]] the multitude being so great that all could<br/>
not hear. I request the brethren not to have any feelings<br/>
for being convened this afternoon for it is necessary. We<br/>
want you all to be still and give attention that all may<br/>
hear. Let none complain because of the situation of<br/>
the congregation. We will do the best we can.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life—for the<br/>
first time in your lives—for the first time in the<br/>
kingdom of God in the nineteenth century without a<br/>
prophet at our head do I step forth to act in my calling<br/>
in connection with the quorum of the Twelve as Apostles<br/>
of Jesus Christ unto this generation—Apostles whom<br/>
God has called by revelation through the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
who are ordained and anointed to bear off the keys of <br/>
the kingdom of God in all the world.</p>",
42658.0,61,,"<p>This people have hitherto walked by sight and not by<br/>
faith. You have had the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|prophet]] in your midst. Do you all<br/>
understand? You have walked by sight and without much<br/>
pleading to the Lord to know whether things were right or not.<br/>
Heretofore you have had a prophet as the mouth of the Lord to<br/>
speak to you, but he has sealed his testimony with his blood;<br/>
and now for the first time are you called to walk by faith and<br/>
not by sight.</p>

<p>The first position [[Brigham Young|I]] take in behalf of the Twelve <br/>
and the people is to ask a few questions. I ask the Latter<br/>
day Saints, do you as individuals at this time want to<br/>
choose a prophet or a guardian? Inasmuch as our Prophet <br/>
and [[Hyrum Smith|Patriarch]] are taken from our midst do you want<br/>
some one to guard to guide and lead you through this<br/>
world into the kingdom of God or not? All that want<br/>
some person to be a guardian or a Prophet a spokesman<br/>
or something else signify it by raising the right hand<br/>
-[No votes]-</p>

<p>When I came to this stand I had peculiar<br/>
feelings and impressions. The faces of this people<br/>
seemed to say we want a shepherd to guide and lead us<br/>
through this world. All who want to draw away<br/>
a party from the Church after them let them do it<br/>
if they can but they will not prosper.</p>

<p>If any man thinks he has influence among<br/>
this people to lead away a party let him try it and he<br/>
will find out that there is power with the Apostles which <br/>
will carry them off victorious through all the world and<br/>
build up and defend the Church and kingdom of God.</p>

<p>What do the people want? I feel as<br/>
though I wanted the privilege to weep and mourn for<br/>
thirty days at least, then rise up shake myself<br/>
and tell the people what the Lord wants of them</p>",
42658.0,62,,"<p>Although [[Brigham Young|my]] heart is too full of mourning to launch forth into<br/>
business transactions and the organization of the Church I feel <br/>
compelled this day to step forth in the discharge of those duties<br/>
God has placed upon me</p>

<p>I now wish to speak of the organization<br/>
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If the<br/>
Church is organized and you want to know how it is <br/>
organized I will tell you. I know your feelings. Do <br/>
you want me to tell your feelings?</p>

<p>Here is President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] who was Counselor<br/>
to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. I ask, where are Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]?<br/>
They are gone beyond the veil and if Elder Rigdon wants<br/>
to act as his Counselor he must go beyond the veil where <br/>
he is</p>

<p>There has been much said about President<br/>
Rigdon being President of the Church and leading the<br/>
people, being the head &amp;c &amp;c. Brother Rigdon has<br/>
come 1600 miles to tell you what he wants to do for<br/>
you. If the people want President Rigdon to lead them<br/>
they may have him; but I say unto you that the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve have the keys of the Kingdom<br/>
in all the world</p>

<p>The Twelve are appointed by the finger <br/>
of God. Here is Brigham; have his knees ever faltered?<br/>
Have his lips ever quivered? Here is [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] and the rest <br/>
of the Twelve an indipendant body who have the<br/>
keys of the priesthood—the keys of the kingdom of<br/>
God to deliver to all the world: this is true, so help<br/>
me God! They stand next to Joseph and are as the <br/>
First Presidency of the Church</p>

<p>I do not know whether my enemies will <br/>
take my life or not and I do not care for I want to be<br/>
with the man I love.</p>",
42658.0,63,,"<p>You cannot fill the office of a Prophet Seer and<br/>
Revelator: God must do this. You are like children without<br/>
a father and sheep without a shepherd. You must not appoint<br/>
any man at your head; if you should the Twelve must ordain<br/>
him. You cannot appoint a man at your head but if you<br/>
do want any other man or men to lead you take them and<br/>
we will go our way to build up the kingdom of God in all<br/>
the world.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] know who are [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]'s friends and who are<br/>
his enemies. I know where the keys of the kingdom are<br/>
and where they will eternally be. You cannot call a man<br/>
to be a Prophet; you cannot take Elder [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] and place <br/>
him above the Twelve; if so he must be ordained by them.</p>

<p>I tell you there is an over anxiety to hurry<br/>
matters here. You cannot take any man and put him<br/>
at the head; you would scatter the Saints to the four <br/>
winds; you would sever the Priesthood. So long as we<br/>
remain as we are the heavenly head is in constant co-operation<br/>
with us; and if you go out of that course God will have<br/>
nothing to do with you.</p>

<p>Again some perhaps think that our <br/>
beloved brother Rigdon would not be honoured, would not<br/>
be looked to as a friend; but if he does right and remains<br/>
faithful he will not act against our counsel nor we against<br/>
his but act together and we shall be as one</p>

<p>I again repeat, no man can stand<br/>
at our head except God reveals it from the heavens. I have<br/>
spared no pains to learn my lesson of the kingdom in<br/>
this world and in the eternal worlds and if it were not so<br/>
I could go and live in peace; but for the gospel and your<br/>
sakes I shall stand in my place. We are liable to be<br/>
killed all the day long. You have never lived by faith.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph the Prophet has laid</p>",
42658.0,64,,"<p>the foundation for a great work and we will build upon it: you have never<br/>
seen the quroums built one upon another. There is an almighty foundation<br/>
laid and we can build a Kingdom such as there never was in the<br/>
world: we can build a Kingdom faster that Satan can kill the<br/>
Saints off.</p>

<p>What do you want? Do you want a Patriarch for<br/>
the whole Church? To this we are perfectly willing. If brother<br/>
[[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel H Smith]] had been living it would have been his<br/>
right and privilege; but he is dead. He is gone to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and<br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]; he is out of the reach of bullets and spears and he<br/>
can waft himself with his brothers his friends and the Saints.</p>

<p>Do you want a Patriarch? Here is brother [[William B. Smith|William]]<br/>
left; here is uncle [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]], uncle to the Prophet Joseph left<br/>
It is their right. The right of the Patriarchal Priesthood belongs<br/>
to Joseph's family.</p>

<p>Do you want a Trustee in Trust? Has there<br/>
been a Bishop who has stood in his lot yet? What is his<br/>
business? To take charge of the temporal affairs so that<br/>
the Twelve and the Elders may go on the<strike>r</strike>ir business. Joseph<br/>
condescended to do their business for them. Joseph<br/>
condescended to offer himself for the Presidency of the United<br/>
States and it was a great condescension.</p>

<p>Do you want a spokesman? Here<br/>
are Elder [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] brother [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] (whom Joseph<br/>
expected to take as a counsellor) and myself. Do you want<br/>
the Church properly organized or do you want a spokesman<br/>
to be chief cook and bottle washer. Elder Rigdon claims to be<br/>
spokesman to the Prophet. Very well, he was; but can<br/>
he now act in that office? If he wants now to be a<br/>
spokesman to the Prophet he must go to the other side <br/>
of the veil for the Prophet is there but Elder Rigdon is here. Why<br/>
will Elder Rigdon be a fool? Who knows anything of the Priesthood<br/>
or of the organization of the Kingdom of God? I am plain.</p>",
42658.0,65,,"<p>Does the Church want it as God organized it? or do you want to<br/>
clip the power of the Priesthood and let those who have the Keys go<br/>
and build up the Kingdom in all the world wherever the people will<br/>
hear them?</p>

<p>If there is a spokesman, if he is King and Priest let<br/>
him go and build up a kingdom unto himself. That is his right. It<br/>
is the right of many here; but the Twelve are at the head of it.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] want to live on the earth and spread truth through<br/>
all the world. You Saints of Latter days want things right. If<br/>
ten thousand rise up and say they have the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]'s<br/>
shoes I know they are impostors. In the Priesthood you have<br/>
a right to build up a kingdom if you know how the Church<br/>
is organized.</p>

<p>Now if you want [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] or [[William Law|William Law]]<br/>
to lead you or anybody else you are welcome to them; but I<br/>
tell you in the name of the Lord that no man can put<br/>
[Figure] another between the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph. [Figure] Why?<br/>
Because Joseph was their file leader and he has committed<br/>
into their hands the keys of the kingdom in this last <br/>
dispensation for all the world. Don't put a thread<br/>
between the Priesthood of God</p>

<p>I ask who has stood next to Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]?<br/>
I have; and I will stand next to him. We have a head<br/>
and that head is the Apostleship, the spirit and power of <br/>
Joseph and we now can begin to see the necessity of that<br/>
Apostleship.</p>

<p>Brother Rigdon was at his side—not above.<br/>
No man has a right to coun<strike>i</strike>sel the Twelve but Joseph Smith<br/>
Think of these <strike>sayings</strike> ^things^. You cannot appoint a Prophet but <br/>
if you let the Twelve remain and act in their place the keys<br/>
of the kingdom are with them and they can manage the affairs<br/>
of the Church and direct all things wright</p>

<p>Now all this does not lessen the character of</p>",
42658.0,66,,"<p>President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]]. Let him magnify his calling and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] will<br/>
want him beyond the veil. Let him be careful what <br/>
he does lest that thread which bind us together be cut assunder<br/>
May God bless us all.""</p>

<p>Much more was said by President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
which I did not write. [Figure]</p>

<p>[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] said: I do not arise to electioneer. I am gratified<br/>
with the open frank and plain exposition of President Young. He has seen<br/>
the relation I bear to my deceased brother. I never did conceive it gave<br/>
me precedance to go before the Twelve.</p>

<p>I do not make any exceptions to anything he has <br/>
said. I beleive there is no power or officer or means wanted to<br/>
carry on the work but what is in the Twelve. I am satisfied that<br/>
no man can carry on the work but the power which is in the Twelve<br/>
as has been said.</p>

<p>There is one thing to secure the salvation of<br/>
this people and that is not in union alone. It is for you to know<br/>
the right and be united—it has been presented by President Young<br/>
All I design to do is to redeem my pledge.</p>

<p>President Young has stood next to the Prophet<br/>
Joseph with the Twelve and I have stood next to them and I will<br/>
stand next to them. I have been at the back of Joseph Smith and<br/>
will be at the back of the Twelve forever and then we will be<br/>
saved.</p>

<p>There is no nead of a President. We have a head<br/>
here. What is that head? The quorum of the Twelve Apostles<br/>
are that head. We now see the necessitty of the Apostleship.</p>

<p>I might rise up as well as any other man to<br/>
ask for the Presidency; but I could not do it without endangering my<br/>
salvation. This is the power that turns the key to bestow salvation<br/>
through all the land in the way that Joseph commenced it—the <br/>
first one called to do the same in all the world. If Joseph<br/>
had any power to bear off the Kingdom of God the Twelve</p>",
42658.0,67,,"<p>have the same.</p>

<p>[[Amasa Mason Lyman|I]] could not advocate the choosing a President and myself a candidate<br/>
so then you know the place I occupy is to stand to the Twelve the same as the<br/>
Twelve did to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] when on one side or the other. I do not want to go before<br/>
them or to fall asleep. I want to see the kingdom roll forth by our united<br/>
faith and efforts"".</p>

<p>President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] called upon [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] to speak in<br/>
his behalf as he could not speak himself.</p>

<p>W. W. Phelps arose and said: With the knowledge I have<br/>
I cannot but suppose that this congregation will act right this day. I believe<br/>
enough has been said to prepare the minds of the people to act.</p>

<p>I have known many of them for 14 years and I have<br/>
always known them to submit with defference to the authorities of the Church<br/>
I have seen the Elders of Israel and the people take their lives in their<br/>
hands and go without purse or scrip in winter and in summer I<br/>
have seen them prepare for war and ready to pour out their hearts blood<br/>
and that is an evidence that they will walk by coun<strike>c</strike>sel.</p>

<p>I am happy to see this little lake of faces and<br/>
to see the same disposition and spirit manifested here to day as<br/>
it was the day after the bloody tragedy when Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum<br/>
Smith]] was brought home dead to this [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]]: then you submitted to<br/>
the law's slow delay and handed the matter over to God. And<br/>
I see the same thing here to day. You are now determined as<br/>
one man to sustain the authorities of the Church and I am happy<br/>
that the men who were on Joseph's right and left hand submit<br/>
themselves to the authority of the Priesthood.</p>

<p>I have feelings about this especially for President<br/>
Rigdon and I want to say that there is a quorum that the Twelve <br/>
belong to and that the people will receive an endowment. I brought<br/>
President Rigdon into that quorum and he receved in part the blessings. I<br/>
could not bear the thought of President Rigdon going into the world<br/>
he did receive part and I hope he will submit.</p>

<p>I want Brother Amasa Lyman to stand on</p>",
42658.0,68,,"<p>the side of the Twelve and they are wanted there still. let them go<br/>
on and sustain them in that high office. You cannot put in a<br/>
guardian of the Church.</p>

<p>We have hitherto walked by sight and if any man<br/>
wanted to know anything he had only to go to brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]].<br/>
Joseph is gone but he has not left us comfortless.</p>

<p>[[William Wines Phelps|I]] want to say that brother Joseph came and<br/>
enlightened me two days after he was burried: he came to me the<br/>
same as when he was alive and in a moment appeared to me in<br/>
his own house. He said tell the drivers to drive on. I asked<br/>
^if the building was on wheels?^ He said certainly. I spoke and away it went. We drove all<br/>
round the hills and valleys. He then told the drivers to drive<br/>
on over the hill into Iowa. I told him [[Devils Creek, Iowa|Devil Creek]] was before<br/>
us. He said drive over Devil Creek; I dont care for Devil Creek<br/>
or any other creek, and we did so; then I awoke.</p>

<p>There is a combination of persons in this city who<br/>
are in continual intercourse with [[William Law|William]] and [[Wilson Law|Wilson Law]] who are<br/>
at the bottom of the matter to destroy all that stand for Joseph<br/>
and there are persons now in this city who are only wanting power<br/>
to murder all who still stand for him; but let us go ahead and<br/>
build up the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and then you will be endowed; when the<br/>
Temple is compleated all the honourable mothers in Israel will<br/>
be endowed as well as the Elders.</p>

<p>If they want to do right uphold the Twelve;<br/>
If they die I am willing to die with them: but do your duty<br/>
and you will be endowed. I will sustain the Twelve as long as I<br/>
have breath.</p>

<p>When Joseph was going away he said he was going<br/>
to die and I said I was willing to die with him; but as I am now<br/>
alive as a lawyer in Israel I am determined to live.</p>

<p>I want you all to recolect that Joseph and <br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] have only been removed from the earth and they now<br/>
counsel and converse with the Gods beyond the reach of powder</p>",
42658.0,69,,"<p>and ball.</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] remarked: What has been said has been well<br/>
said. If there are men here who are our enemies I tell you when they will<br/>
cease to be here: they will be here while you will deal with them. If I<br/>
exchange property or deal with men I do it with those whom I know to be<br/>
faithful.</p>

<p>If there are wicked men here it is because we support them<br/>
Stop dealing with them and they will go away. Will I support them?<br/>
No; I would deal with all honest men whom I know to be such.</p>

<p>I am willing to do good to all men especially<br/>
to the household of faith. Our enemies will cease to dwell here when<br/>
you cease to deal with them. Mobs and wicked men will cease<br/>
when you cease to support them. I know we can all live and<br/>
be happy too when we deal with honest men. If a man wants<br/>
a doctor or a lawyer he will send directly for the worst man he can<br/>
find. I would die a natural death sooner than I would have<br/>
a wicked doctor to help me off. I would go without sueing all<br/>
the days of my life before I would go to a lawyer to sue. I will<br/>
not say anything about the merchants because you all know them.</p>

<p>[Figure] President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] again arose and said:<br/>
""There is more business than can be done this afternoon but we can<br/>
accomplish all we want to have done without <strike>without</strike> calling<br/>
this convention of the whole Church. I am going to present to<br/>
you the leading items.</p>

<p>I do not ask you to take my counsel or advise<br/>
alone but every one of you act for yourself; but if brother [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]]<br/>
is the person you want to lead you vote for him but not<br/>
unless you intend to follow him and support him <strike>any</strike> as<br/>
you did [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. Do not say so unless you mean to<br/>
take his counsel hereafter.</p>

<p>And I would say the same for the<br/>
Twelve. Dont make a covenant to support them unless<br/>
you intend to abide by their counsel and if they do not</p>",
42658.0,70,,"<p>counsel you as you please dont turn round and oppose them.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] want every man before he enters into a<br/>
covenant to know what he is going to do; but we want to know<br/>
if this people is going to support the Priesthood. In the name<br/>
of Israel's God if you say you will, do so.</p>

<p>We want men appointed to take charge of<br/>
the business that did lay on the shoulders of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. Let<br/>
me say to you that this kingdom will spread more than ever<br/>
The Twelve have the power now the Seventies the Elders and<br/>
all of you can have power to go and build up the Kingdom<br/>
in the name of Israel's God.</p>

<p>[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] will not hold all the people who <br/>
will come into the Kingdom. We want to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]<br/>
so as to get our endowment and if we do our best and Satan<br/>
will not let us build it we will go into the wilderness and<br/>
we will receive the endowment for we will receive an<br/>
endowment anyhow.</p>

<p>Will you abide our counsel? I again<br/>
say my soul for any man's if they will abide our counsel<br/>
that they will go right into heaven. We have all the signs<br/>
and tokens to give to the porter at the door and he will let us<br/>
in.</p>

<p>I ask you as quorums do you want Bro<br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] to stand forward as your leader your guide your<br/>
spokesman. President Rigdon wants me to bring up<br/>
the other question first and that is does the Church want and<br/>
is it their ownly desire to sustain the Twelve as the First Presidency<br/>
of this people?</p>

<p>Here are the Apostles the Bible the Book of<br/>
Mormon the Doctrine and Covenants they are written on the<br/>
tablet of my heart. If the Church want the Twelve to <br/>
stand as the head—the First Presidency of the Church and at<br/>
the head of this kingdom in all the world stand next to Joseph</p>",
42658.0,71,,"<p>walk up unto their calling and hold the keys of this Kingdom every man<br/>
every woman every quorum is now put in order and you are now the<br/>
sole controllers of it.</p>

<p>All who are in favour of this in all the congregation of<br/>
the Saints manifest it by holding up the right hand.—[There was <br/>
a universal vote.]—If there are any of the contrary mind—every <br/>
man and every woman who does not want the Twelve to preside<br/>
lift up your hands in like manner.—[No hands up.] This<br/>
supersedes the other question and trying it by quorums.</p>

<p>We feel as though we could take brother<br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] in our bosom along with us. We want such men as<br/>
brother Rigdon. He has been sent away by brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] to<br/>
build up a Kingdom. Let him keep the instructions and<br/>
calling; let him raise up a mighty kingdom in [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]]<br/>
and we will lift up his hands to Almighty God. [[Brigham Young|I]] think<br/>
we may have a printing office and a gathering there. If<br/>
the devil still trys to kill us he will have enough to do.</p>

<p>The next is President [[William Marks|Marks]]. Our feeling,<br/>
is to let him stand as President of the Stake as heretofore<br/>
We can build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] &amp;c.</p>

<p>You did not know who you had amongst<br/>
you. Joseph so loved this people that he gave his life for<br/>
them. [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] loved his brother and this people unto death<br/>
Joseph and Hyrum have given their lives for the Church.<br/>
But very few knew Joseph's character. He loved you unto <br/>
death. You did not know it until after his death. He has<br/>
now sealed his testimony with his blood.</p>

<p>If the Twelve had been here we would<br/>
not have seen him given up. He should not have been given <br/>
up. He was in your midst but you did not know him<br/>
He has been taken away for the people are not worthy of<br/>
him.</p>

<p>The world is wide. [[Brigham Young|I]] can preach in [[England|England]]</p>",
42658.0,72,,"<p>[[Ireland|Ireland]] [[Scotland|Scotland]] [[France|France]] [[Germany|Germany]] &amp;c; [[Brigham Young|I]] can preach in all the world and<br/>
the devils cannot find us. I will sware to you I will not <br/>
be given up.</p>

<p>There is much to be done. You have <br/>
men among you who sleep with one eye open. The foundation<br/>
is laid by our [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] and we will build thereon. No other<br/>
foundation can be laid but that which is laid and we will<br/>
have our endowment if the Lord will.</p>

<p>As the authorities do not want us to do<br/>
military duty dont do it. If it is necessary my kneck<br/>
is ready for the knife. As for myself I am determined<br/>
to build up the Kingdom of God and by the bye there will<br/>
be a gleaning of grapes and it may be said ""to your tents<br/>
O Israel"".</p>

<p>We can build on the foundation which<br/>
was laid by the Prophet. Joseph has finished his work<br/>
and all the Devils in hell and all the mobers on earth could<br/>
not take his life until he had accomplished his work. God<br/>
said I will put a veil over his eyes and lead him up<br/>
to the slaughter like a sheep to be killed for the people<br/>
are not worthy of him though God loves this people.</p>

<p>Let no man suppose that the kingdom<br/>
is rent from you that it is not organized. If all the quorums of<br/>
the Church were slain except the High Priest they would rise up<br/>
with the keys of the Kingdom and have the power of the Priesthood<br/>
upon them and build up the Kingdom and the devil cannot<br/>
help himself.</p>

<p>You can go to a healthy country buy the land<br/>
and dont let a cursed scoundrel get in your midst. Let there be<br/>
good men good women and whenever a man comes with a wheelbarrow<br/>
full of goods dont let him land dont let him a house or buy <br/>
of him.</p>

<p>Suppose we had ten thousand such places and</p>",
42658.0,73,,"<p>increasing in greatness perfectly free from these poor devils we should feel<br/>
better than we do now. Let us all be humble and get our endowments<br/>
all be humble industrious and prudent what sort of a kingdom would it<br/>
be? The foundation is laid for more than we can think or talk<br/>
about to day.</p>

<p>Is it the will of this congregation that they will<br/>
be <strike>theth</strike>^ tithed^ until the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] is finished as they have heretofore been?<br/>
If so signify it by the uplifted hand—[<u>The vote</u> <u>was unanimous</u>]—</p>

<p>The men will act who never acted before<br/>
and they will have the power and authority to do it. Is it the<br/>
minds of the congregation to loose the hands of the Twelve and<br/>
enable us to go and preach to all the world? We want to know<br/>
the feelings of the people. Is it your will to support the Twelve<br/>
in all the world in their missions.—[<u>The</u> <u>congregation susttained</u><br/>
<u>this</u> <u>question by a unanimous vote</u>]— Will you leave it to<br/>
the Twelve to dictate about the finances of the Church and will<br/>
it be the mind of this people that the Twelve teach what will<br/>
be the duties of the Bishops in hand ling the affairs of the<br/>

of some trying to draw away parties after them.</p>

<p><u>Discourse</u> <u>of</u> <u>President</u> <u>Brigham</u> <u>Young</u></p>

<p>(Synopsis from my Journal)</p>

<p>I have many things to speak of. It was<br/>
my mind in the first place that we should have suitable time<br/>
to meditate upon all matters and weigh them even every subject<br/>
wherin we felt interested. When the question was asked me if</p>",
42658.0,76,,"<p>they should continue to baptize for the dead [[Brigham Young|I]] said I had no counsel to<br/>
give upon that subject at present but should think it not best to attend<br/>
to it at that time</p>

<p>I have learned some things I did not know<br/>
when I came home. I discover a disposition in the sheep to<br/>
scatter abroad now the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Shepherd]] is taken away. I do not say<br/>
that it will never be right for this people to go from here or scatter<br/>
abroad but let them wait until the time comes and until they<br/>
get counsel to do so.</p>

<p>The report has gone through the city <br/>
that the Twelve have secret understanding with those men<br/>
who are going away and taking companies with them that<br/>
they shall take all they can and that although the Twelve will<br/>
blow it up yet privately they wish it to go on but if it was<br/>
the last words I had to say before going into the eternal world<br/>
I would sware by the Holy Trinity that it is utterly false and<br/>
and not one word of truth in it. There is no man who has any<br/>
right to lead away one soul out of this city by the consent of the<br/>
Twelve except [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and [[George Miller|George Miller]] who have had<br/>
the privilege of taking the Pine Company where they pleased<br/>
but not another soul has the consent of the Twelve to go<br/>
with them.</p>

<p>There is no man who has any liberty<br/>
to lead away people into the wilderness from this Church or<br/>
to lead them anywhere else by the consent of the Twelve or the<br/>
Church except the case above named and I tell you in the<br/>
name of Jesus Christ that if Lyman Wight and George Miller<br/>
take a course contrary to our counsel and will not act in<br/>
concert with us they will be damned and go to distruction<br/>
If men will not stop striving to be great and exalted and<br/>
lead away parties from us and striving to weaken our<br/>
hands they will fall and not rise again and I will destroy<br/>
their influence in this Church with the help of God and</p>",
42658.0,77,,"<p>my brethren. [[Brigham Young|I]] wish you to distinctly understand that the counsel of<br/>
the Twelve is for every family that does not belong to the Pine Company <br/>
to stay here in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] build up the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and get their endowment.<br/>
Dont scatter. United we stand divided we fall.</p>

<p>It has been whispered about that all who go<br/>
into the wilderness with [[Lyman Wight|Wight]] and [[George Miller|Miller]] will get their endowment<br/>
but they cannot give an endowment in the wilderness. If we<br/>
do not carry out the plan laid down by [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and the pattern<br/>
he has given for us to work by we cannot get any further<br/>
endowment. I want it to sink deep into your hearts that<br/>
you may remember it. I repeat it. Let me reason with you<br/>
If you stir up the flame of dissent will you get an endowment? No.<br/>
You get a party to run here and another there and divide our strength<br/>
and weaken our hands and we shall be left and our enemies will flock<br/>
around us and destroy us. In that case you will not get your<br/>
endowment but will sink and not rise—go to hell and not to the bosom<br/>
of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]].</p>

<p>Do the people leave here because they are<br/>
affraid? Do you fear those who have power to kill the body<br/>
If you leave this place for fear of mob before God tell you to go<br/>
you will have no place of rest but you will flee from place to<br/>
place and go like the Jews until God raises up some other<br/>
people to redeem you for if the Devil scares you from this<br/>
place he will scare you from all other places.</p>

<p>Let no man go from this place but the<br/>
Pine Company brethren but stay here sow plant &amp; build. Put in your<br/>
plowshares into the praries. One plowshare will do more to<br/>
drive off the mob than two guns. Let us stay here<br/>
where the bones of Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel]] [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos]]<br/>
and Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Smith]] are. Joseph has said if I am slain<br/>
in battle or fall in any way I want my body laid in<br/>
Nauvoo. I had rather have the dead body of the Prophet<br/>
than some men who are alive and I should rather have<br/>
the clothes of the Prophet stuffed with straw for President</p>",
42658.0,78,,"<p>of the United States than any man whose name is now before<br/>
the nation for a candidate for he would not do as much harm <br/>
We want to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] in this place. If we have to build <br/>
it as the Jews built the walls of the [[Second Temple, Jerusalem|Temple]] in [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]<br/>
with a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other. How<br/>
easily some men are scared. [[Brigham Young|I]] have never been frightened<br/>
yet and I know other men who have not.</p>

<p>Do you suppose the mouth of God <br/>
is closed to be opened no more unto us. If this was so I<br/>
would not give the ashes of a rie straw for the Salvation<br/>
of the Church. If God has ceased to speak by the<br/>
Holy Ghost or revelation there is no salvation; but this is not<br/>
the case.</p>

<p>There seems to be a disposition manifested<br/>
by many to leave [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and go into the wilderness or<br/>
somewhere else. But what if we should go into the<br/>
wilderness and we should ask God to give us an<br/>
endowment and he should ask us if we were driven <br/>
from Nauvoo and who drove us. The Devil<br/>
drove us would be the answer. ""Well"" he might <br/>
say ""did you not know that I had power over the<br/>
devil"" Yes; but one said ""I would not give a Jack<br/>
knife for all Nauvoo and another said I would not<br/>
give a pair of mules for the best farm in [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]]<br/>
&amp; I was affraid.</p>

<p>Would the Lord give an endowment to <br/>
a people who was frightened away from their duty<br/>
These who are wishing to lead away parties contrary to counsel<br/>
I would not wish them damned worse than to have a company<br/>
after their own likeing for they will soon quaral among<br/>
themselves.</p>

<p>If we should go into the wilderness<br/>
and ask the Lord to give us an endowment he might ask<br/>
us saying ""Did I not give you rock in Nauvoo to</p>",
42658.0,79,,"<p>build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] with?""</p>

<p>""Yes.""</p>

<p>""Did I not through my Providence furnish men to quary<br/>
and cut the stone and prepare it for the building""</p>

<p>""Yes.""</p>

<p>""Did I not give you means to build the Temple there?</p>

<p>""Yes.""</p>

<p>""Very well, had you died in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] on the walls<br/>
of the Temple or in your fields I would have taken you to <br/>
myself and raised up men to officiate for you and you would<br/>
have enjoyed the highest glory. Did you make a<br/>
sacrifice by tithing?</p>

<p>""No""</p>

<p>""Well I dont wonder you did not believe I had power over the <br/>
devil.""</p>

<p>Such may go away. But [[Brigham Young|I]] want to have<br/>
the faithful stay here and settle this city. We shall require the<br/>
truth of all your property as the tithing for the building of the Temples<br/>
for the poor and for the Priesthood. I want my support and living by<br/>
the Church hereafter so that I can give my whole time to the<br/>
business of the Church. I have always supported myself heretofore<br/>
in all my travels and labours.</p>

<p>While in [[England|England]] in one year we circulated 60,000<br/>
tracts upon our doctrine. This ought to be done in all the world and<br/>
it can be where the Elders are faithful to their calling.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Testator has been preserved till<br/>
now but he has now sealed his testimony with his blood and his testament<br/>
should be put in force. While the Testator lived it was all in his own<br/>
hands but now he is dead.</p>

<p>There is no remission of sins without the sheding<br/>
of blood. You will soon wake up and know things as they are<br/>
There has been a great debt paid. There will be no need of more<br/>
blood of the Saints being shed at present. By and by you will</p>",
42658.0,80,,"<p>understand and see that all is right</p>

<p>Wo! Wo! Wo! unto all who have shed the blood of the <br/>
Saints and the Lord's Anointed. It must needs be that offences<br/>
come but wo unto them by whom they come.</p>

<p>To those who want to go away from this<br/>
place [[Brigham Young|I]] would say wait until the time comes. I will give you<br/>
the key. [[North America|North]] and [[South America|South America]] is Zion and as soon as<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] is done and you get your endowment you can go and <br/>
build up stakes but dont be in haste. Wait until the Lord<br/>
says, Go.</p>

<p>If you have the Spirit of God you can discern<br/>
right from wrong. When all is right in the Priesthood and a man<br/>
rises up and speaks in the Spirit of God and just right all will<br/>
say Amen; but when a man rises up and talks as smooth as <br/>
oil if he is not right there will be many queries about it. It will<br/>
not edify the body. I give this as a key.</p>

<p>You may go all over North and South America<br/>
^and build up stakes^ when the time comes. The whole continant of America must be<br/>
organized into Districts and Presiding Elders appointed over<br/>
each district. The time has come when all things must<br/>
be set in order. I have had these things upon my mind a<strike>ll</strike><br/>
long time. The time has come now for bickering to cease<br/>
There must be a strict order of things and we are no longer bound<br/>
to harbor blacklegs counterfeiters &amp; bogus makers. We know<br/>
all about them. They have been in our midst long enough. I<br/>
advise all the Saints to have no dealing with such men. Let<br/>
them alone. The time has come that they should be whiped<br/>
out of our midst. Let those men alone—let the ungodly<br/>
dealers alone. And as to the Doctors who are in our midst<br/>
who are our enemies I would say let them alone also for I have<br/>
no doubt that three to one who have died in this place had a<br/>
doctor.</p>

<p>And I would say wo unto you lawyers</p>",
42658.0,81,,"<p>for your whole study is to put down truth and put a lie in its stead. [[Brigham Young|I]] want<br/>
the lawyers to know that we have common sense. They want to make<br/>
you believe that when you spell baker you mean cider or wiskey<br/>
Now let the Doctors and Lawyers alone and leave off bitterness and<br/>
evil speaking and you will build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and get an endowment<br/>
All you lawyers go away and let us alone and when we get full of the<br/>
devil and want you we will send for you. We may then have a<br/>
more convenient season.</p>

<p>I want to say to the Saints do not harbour<br/>
blacklegs counterfeiters &amp; bogus makers. Wipe them away. It is time<br/>
to carry out the design of our Prophet. Do cease to employ doctors<br/>
lawyers and merchants who will use your purse and then mob<br/>
you. Store your grain in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] for you will want it<br/>
there to eat while you are building the Temple.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hands upon the Temple<br/>
be united and to the Committee I would say dont turn away any<br/>
person because he is an Englishman Scotchman Irishman or any other<br/>
nation but employ every man you can and build the Temple and<br/>
your homes.</p>

<p>I would rather pay out every cent to build up<br/>
this place and get an endowment even if I was driven the next minute<br/>
without anything to take with me.</p>

<p>As to the doctors let them go. I can prove<br/>
that a doctor in this place doctored a woman who was in the family way<br/>
and he did not know it until she was delivered and both the woman<br/>
and child died and if you employ them you will all die; but the<br/>
time has come when you ne<strike>e</strike>ad no longer support them.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between the law of<br/>
the land and the law of the Church. You have the privilege of<br/>
keeping all shops that does not come in contact with the law of the<br/>
the State County or City so I will evade the law says the dealer<br/>
and give away wiskey and sell a little tobaco or something else<br/>
and charge enough for both but the law of the Church will reach</p>",
42658.0,82,,"<p>such men if they are members for they will be cut off.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] had a dream which I will here relate. <br/>
I saw a fruit tree and I went into the tree to search for fruit. I<br/>
soon descovered that some of the main branches on the top growing<br/>
from the main body was dead. It seamed necessary to cut<br/>
off the dead branches in order to save the tree. So I told<br/>
some person to help me cut them off and he steped on to a large<br/>
green limb. They were affraid it would break so I put my <br/>
shoulder under it and held it up while he cut off the dead<br/>
branches. It cracked the green limb but it did not break<br/>
After we cut off the dead branches the wounds healed up and<br/>
the tree grew finely.</p>

<p>Now let us cut off the dead branches<br/>
of the Church that good fruit may grow and the voice will<br/>
soon be heard go and build Zion and the great Temple of <br/>
the Lord.</p>

<p>A word unto the Seventies. They will<br/>
be organized into their different quorums and a presidency of<br/>
of seven men will be chosen out of the first Seventy to preside<br/>
over each quorum.</p>

<p>Now as you have been warned let <br/>
every man warn his neighbour and we will give every man<br/>
his appointment as soon as convenient.</p>

<p>May the Lord bless you in the name<br/>
of Jesus Christ Amen.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the assembly was again<br/>
addressed in a simlar strain by [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and<br/>
President Young but I was at home writing and hence<br/>
did not take notes; and in the evening in company with<br/>
Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] I rode out to bro [[John Benbow|John Benbow]]s and spent the<br/>

most noble spirits that ever graced humanity or tabernacled in the<br/>

throughout all generations. Though counted among transgressors<br/>
they like the Messiah have shed their blood for the sins of<br/>
the people and freely offered their lives and sealed their testimony<br/>
^with their blood.^</p>

<p>Thou hast lived to see the fall of thy <br/>
sons by the rage of Gentile hands but like an eternal rock in<br/>
the midst of the ocean thou has stood and God has given thee<br/>
the desire of thy heart in seeing the Keys of his Kingdom<br/>
held in the hands of thy posterity so planted on the earth<br/>
that they shall never be taken from it until He reigns whose<br/>
right it is to reign.</p>

<p>Let thy heart be comforted in the midst<br/>

remembered in thy wants during the remainder of thy days and<br/>

having seen the salvation of God in laying an everlasting<br/>
foundation for the deliverance of Israel through the instrumentality<br/>
of thy sons.</p>

charge of all the Churches in Europe Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] was <br/>

^of your heart^ given you in all things in righteousness before God.""</p>",
42658.0,87,,"<p>The next day was Sunday and I was called upon to<br/>
address the congregation of Saints assembled in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] as I was about to leave<br/>
for my mission to [[England|England]]. The following is a few of the items I presented<br/>
to the people in my discourse.</p>

<p>""There is a Spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty<br/>
giveth it understanding. It is through this principle that this congregation is<br/>
assembled together at this place. You had understanding of the things of God<br/>
^by^<strike>and His Spirit.</strike>.  ^by the Spirit of God.^</p>

<p>I have now one important declaration to make to you<br/>
and that is that inasmuch as you will be united in heart and mind and<br/>
in action in supporting your counsellors—the Priesthood of God—the<br/>
authorities of the Church and follow the counsel given you as you<br/>
have endeavoured to follow the counsel of the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] while he was living <br/>
you will be safe and blessed and will prosper but if you are divided and<br/>
reject the counsel of God you will fall. Union and faithfulness is your<br/>
salvation. It is true you have been led by one of the best men that<br/>
ever graced humanity or tabernacled in the flesh but he is gone; he<br/>
has sealed is testimony with his blood. He loved this people unto death.</p>

<p>[Figure] I would now call upon this people to be<br/>
united in building up ^on^ the foundation which the Prophet Joseph has<br/>
laid You have been called to suffer much in the cause in which<br/>
you are engaged but if judgement begins at the house of God [[Babylon|Babylon]] will<br/>
not escape and if there is a fire in a green tree a dry tree will not<br/>
escape. There is no people ^more^ prepared for the shock that is coming<br/>
on the earth than ^the^ Latter-day Saints. The object we have is to<br/>
secure blessings beyond the veil in the first resurrection. This<br/>
is what we are preparing for.</p>

<p>Again I would say let not the Saints be<br/>
troubled because they have lost their Prophet. I would ask because<br/>
the Prophet has sealed his testimony with his blood does that destroy<br/>
the Gospel or take away the Power of God. Is truth annihalated<br/>
or has the Priesthood found a burying place? I tell you nay<br/>
His testimony is now in force. Therefore my counsel is to</p>",

Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both spiritual and temporal<br/>
We wish you to give dilligent heed to his counsel in all things and as we<br/>
have not the opportunity of informing you of what has transpired this<br/>

<p>Though our [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] be slain for the word of God<br/>

Church and the heavens are not closed neither is the mouth of the Almighty<br/>

may have the privilege of appointing a committee to visit the land <br/>
of America to prepare a location for a settlement of the brethren from<br/>

in all the world that may be visited by Elder Wilford Woodruff that<br/>
inasmuch as they will hearken unto his counsel they shall be blessed;<br/>
inasmuch as they shall render him any assistance in his mission<br/>
they will be doing the will of God and shall not lose their reward. And<br/>
we desire that all Saints may use their efforts to sustain him in this<br/>
important mission which he is called to fulfil by their faith prayers<br/>

established in these last days.</p>

pile of coal and dashed my water into the fire which was not larger than<br/>
a half bushel measure at the same time a bucket of water flung by Capt<br/>
Davis struck the fire and it was extinguished.</p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Peculiar</u> <u>Dream</u> [FIGURE]</p>

<p>While at my father-in-laws I dreamt a peculiar<br/>
dream. Much of it was unutterable and cannot be written. Indeed<br/>
I cannot comprehend it myself. Among other things I thought<br/>
I was called to hold with the Twelve the Keys of the Kingdom in all<br/>
the world and I travelled with them over much of the earth<br/>
and finally travelled through many countries alone and when<br/>
I got through I saw many things which I cannot write and<br/>
in the end [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the Prophet assissted me to come into<br/>
the place where he was and pointed out my work <strike>and</strike> portion<br/>
^and^ <strike>of</strike> labour. I immediately entered into the duties<br/>
assigned me.</p>

<p>I also had on the same night another<br/>
dream. I was in the presence of the Prophet Joseph</p>",
42658.0,95,,""">Nov 24</time>th after leaving Boston<br/>
I was with the Saints in [[New Bedford, Bristol County, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] with whom I held meetings<br/>
that day during which three were baptized.</p>

<p>The Monday I spent taking a view of the<br/>
city which for beauty and elegance and location is hardly to be<br/>
surpassed. It is <strike>a</strike> ^the most^ noted city for fitting out <strike>of</strike> walemen.<br/>
The whole city has been built up through the wale trade. The<br/>
docks were lined with casks of wale and sperm oil. We went<br/>
aboard of a number of wale ships which were fitting out which<br/>
would carry from fifteen hundred to three thousand barrels of<br/>
oil. A sister gave me three pair of specimen of shels brought<br/>
from the wale country.</p>

<p>I arrived in New York on the<br/>
29 where I received a letter from my father and mother <strike>in law</strike><br/>
stating that Samuel Deming had turned him off from the<br/>
mill which he had rented and occupied all his lifetime to old<br/>
age and after he had spent the last summer in repairing the mills<br/>
and when they were ready to start and the Winter coming<br/>
on he turned him off without notice.</p>

<p>At [[Flushing, New York City, Queens County, New York|New York]] I also received a letter<br/>
from President [[Brigham Young|Young]] in answer to the one I wrote him from<br/>
[[Chicago, Cook County, Illinois|Chicago]] and several days after its receipt I wrote a long<br/>
letter to <strike>President Young</strike> ^him^ informing him of the recklessness of<br/>
[[William Smith|William Smith]] and [[George Washington Joshua Adams|George J. Adams]] during that season.</p>",

for some days.</p>",
42658.0,97,,""">30th Dec 1844</time></p>

<p>I dreamt that I was in Council with the martyred [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]]<br/>
and [[Hyrum Smith|Patriarch]] and also with the quorum of the Twelve Apostles in<br/>
America. I thought we had all to be ordained for some purpose<br/>
I was called upon by President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and another person to assist<br/>
in administering the ordinances. In the midst of the Council [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney<br/>
Rigdon]] came in and was objected to by Hyrum Smith. I<br/>
awoke and again fell asleep and dreamt of being in Council<br/>
with the Twelve and others. I made an address to them<br/>
[[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] arose to address the meeting but was stoped<br/>
by some female and was followed by Elder [[Willard Trowbridge Snow|Willard Snow]].</p>

<p>I <strike>have</strike> recorded this dream at the time in<br/>

<p><u>Synopsis</u><br/>
of the travels and labours of Wilford Woodruff in 1844</p>

<p>I travelled in the United States in many of the principal<br/>
places and minor towns and cities in all visiting between 50<br/>
and a hundred journeyed through some part of [[Canada, British North America|Canada]] and crossed<br/>
the Atlantic making in all a distance of ten thousand and<br/>
fifty miles.</p>

<p>I held fifty three meetings and attended<br/>

<p>I met with the quorum of the Twelve in twelve Councils<br/>
and with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] the quorum of Apostles and <br/>
other brethren in transacting the affairs of the Kingdom in <br/>
thirteen Councils.</p>

42658.0,99,,""">5</time>th was Sunday and we held meetings<br/>
in the Music Hall at which myself and companions Elders<br/>
Dan Jones, Clark Hardy and Holmes addressed the Saints.</p>",
42658.0,100,,""">19</time>th in the morning<br/>
I preached in the Music Hall [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] and in the afternoon<br/>
as I entered the meeting Elder [[Thomas Ward|Ward]] spoke to me and wished<br/>
me to go with him to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and attend evening meeting<br/>
as there had been an appointment for an American Elder<br/>
to preach. Accordingly we took the rail and arrived<br/>
just as the meeting commenced. Elder Ward introduced<br/>
me and I addressed the meeting 1 hour and twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Here I again met Elders [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]]<br/>
[[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and [[Charles Miller|Charles Miller]] with whom I pleasantly<br/>
spent the Monday and returned on the following day to Liverpool.</p>

<p>In the 9th No of the Millennial Star<br/>
vol there is a long address of mine written to the Saints in the [[British Isles|British Islands]].</p>

<p>About the middle of February I received<br/>
letters from Elder John Taylor from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and from <br/>
P P Pratt who was presiding over the eastern Churches in </p>",
42658.0,101,,""">Feb 16. 1845</time>.</p>

<p>There were present Wilford Woodruff President of the Mission<br/>
his Counsellors Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and [[Thomas Ward|Ward]] with five High Priests<br/>
30 Elders 31 Priests 21 Teachers and 4 deacons.</p>

<p>We met with the officers before the public<br/>
meeting and laid before them the buisness of the day and then<br/>
a vast assembly of the Saints gathered in Conference capacity<br/>
and we laid before them the changes designed for the Manchester<br/>
Conference and it was proposed that Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] preside<br/>
over the Conference and Elder [[James Darling Ross|J. D. Ross]] over the Manchester<br/>
branch both of whom accepted their appointment. Sacrament<br/>
was then administered which occupied the time till dark.</p>

<p>In the evening we had another mamoth<br/>
meeting. Elder Hedlock first addressed the assembly and<br/>
then he and Elder Ward had to leave for ^[[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]^ <br/>
but could scarcely get out of the crowded Hall. I then arose and <br/>
addressed the congregation and the Spirit of the Lord was with<br/>
us and love and union pervaded the congregation.</p>

<p>It was a scene to make the heart <br/>
glad to behold together in a foreign mission so many Saints.</p>",
42658.0,102,,"<p>united together in the Everlasting Covenant. I had often thought how<br/>
much I should like to see the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] meet with a <br/>
Conference of Saints in [[England|England]] but it was not granted<br/>
to the British nation to have the Prophet in their midst nor<br/>
to him nor us to see him meet in England the thousands who<br/>
had entered into the New Covenant which God through his mission<br/>
had mad unto Israel.</p>

<p>This was one of the most interesting<br/>
Conference I ever attended abroad and this day was fullfilled<br/>
a prophecy which I gave in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|House of the Lord]] in Kirtland<br/>
in 1837 that I should attend a Conference with Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]<br/>
in the [[British Isles|British Isles]].</p>

<p>On the 3rd day after our conference I<br/>
took the railway cars from [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] to [[Bradford, Yorkshire, England|Bradford]] where I<br/>
arrived at noon and in the afternoon, [[Elijah Funk Sheets|Elijah F Sheets]] arrived<br/>
from [[Leeds, Yorkshire, England|Leeds]]. He had come over from America with<br/>
Elders [[Joseph Albert Stratton|Stratten]] and [[Elisha Hildebrand Davis|Davis]]. We were truly glad to meet<br/>
each other on a foreign shore and to attend meetings together<br/>
in the evening with the Saints of that place. Brother<br/>
Sheets was presiding over the Bradford Conference.</p>

<p>The next day in company with<br/>
Elders Sheets and [[James Ure|Ure]] presidents of the Bradford and Sheffield<br/>
Conferences I <strike>left</strike> ^walked^ to [[Idle, Yorkshire, England|Idle]] in [[Yorkshire, England|Yorkeshire]] three miles from Bradford<br/>
to pay</p>

<p>A Visit to the Grave of [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Lorenzo Barnes]]</p>

<p>When we arrived about halfway we had a fair view<br/>
of Idle and the Churchyard where for a season was laid<br/>
the remains of our beloved brother until the brethren of the<br/>
household of faith to which he belonged removed the dust of<br/>
the honoured dead to his native land and laid it in the<br/>
burial place of the Saints.</p>",
42658.0,103,,"<p>We had a beautiful green vale to pass through before <br/>
arriving at [[Idle, Yorkshire, England|Idle]] which is on the top of a hill. The fields of grass<br/>
were as green as in May though it was but February which gave<br/>
the landscape around us a picturesque and verdant charm. We<br/>
were walking on the road which our departed brother had walked over<br/>
many scores of times to preach the gospel of Jesus and I felt<br/>
sorrowful and filled with meditation.</p>

<p>Arriving at Idle containing a population of <br/>
seven thousand inhabitants and a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ <br/>
of Latter-Day Saints numbering 37 members we called upon <br/>
Elder [[Thomas Cordingly|Thomas Cordingly]] and family who had the care of Elder<br/>
[[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Barnes]] through his sickness and death. They pointed out<br/>
to me the house and room where he passed ^t^h<strike>is</strike>^e^ last hours of <br/>
his mortal life.</p>

<p>After partaking of some refreshments we<br/>
walked to the Churchyard and reverently gazed upon the peaceful silent<br/>
grave of our beloved brother. My feelings were sensitive and <br/>
sad. As I stood upon his grave I realised that I was standing<br/>
over the body of one of the Elders of Israel of the ""horns of Joseph,""<br/>
one of the members of "" Zion's Camp"" who travelled more than <br/>
one thousand miles in 1834 for the redemption of his proseuted<br/>
and afflicted brethren ready to lay down his life for their sakes<br/>
and whose fidelity was a strong trait of character.</p>

<p>While standing upon his grave I offered<br/>
up my vocal prayer to Israel's God that I might die the death<br/>
of the righteous when called away and that my last end might<br/>
be as safe as our beloved and departed brother's and that his sacred<br/>
dust might be called forth in the morn of the First Resurrection.</p>",
42658.0,104,,"<p>Meditating upon his life I retired from the grave of Elder [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Barnes]] in company<br/>
with my brethren who had come with me to pay our reverant respect<br/>
and remembrance of our departed brother and on our return to the<br/>
family who attended him in his last moments I made enquiries<br/>
and obtained the following information.</p>

<p><u>The Cause of Sickness &amp; Death of Lorenzo Barnes</u></p>

<p>On^e^ day in the latter part of September ^1843^<br/>
Elder Barnes walked very fast for about thirteen miles to<br/>
reach the railway station in time to take the cars. Some<br/>
part of the way he ran and got into a high state of perspiration<br/>
and only had time step into the train just as it was starting<br/>
He rode on the railroad for about twenty miles during which<br/>
time he became entirely dulled which <strike>thro</strike> ^gave^ him a severe cold<br/>
that setted upon his lungs and brought on quick consumption<br/>
from which he never recovered. He attended conference and preached<br/>
several times afterwards but was very feble. The last time<br/>
he preached was from the passage—""There remaineth therefore<br/>
a rest for the people of God"". After he was confined to his<br/>
bed he was asked if he would have a Physician but answered<br/>
""No."" If he died he would die a natural death. If he lived<br/>
he should live unto the Lord if he died he should die unto the<br/>
Lord. He manifested a great desire to live if it should be<br/>
the will of God that he might return to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. He was<br/>
deprived of his reason during some portion of the time and his<br/>
whole conversation on such intervals would he about Nauvoo<br/>
how he should yet there and his friends. He spoke of his<br/>
mother frequently. The night before his death he had his<br/>
reason and he then bore a strong and faithful testimony of the<br/>
truth of the fulness of the Gospel as taught by the Latterday Saints</p>",
42658.0,105,,"<p>I also learned that Elder [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Barnes]] suffered by going with<br/>
poor boots and wet feet from place to place. He was slow to make his<br/>
wants known to the brethren and some were slow to administer to them<br/>
until he got sick. Every attention however was paid to him after he<br/>
was confined to his bed but then it was too late.</p>

<p>I enquired if there were any writings left by <br/>
him such as Journals &amp;c but could find nothing excepting several<br/>
fragments of a correspondence in poetry between himself and his intended<br/>
wife which showed the strong fidelity of his heart so characteristic<br/>
of the man throughout every action of his life. These fragments I<br/>
copied from his M. S. into my daily Journal.</p>

<p>I preached to a good congregation at [[Idle, Yorkshire, England|Idle]] that evening<br/>
and the next day in company with Elders [[Elijah Funk Sheets|Sheets]] and [[James Ure|Ure]] and [[Abraham Lord|Abraham<br/>
Lord]] the presiding Elder of the Idle Branch I returned to [[Bradford, Yorkshire, England|Bradford]].</p>

<p>The brethren placarded the town with the following<br/>
notice:</p>

<p><u>Conference</u>: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day<br/>
Saints will hold their Conference in the Philadelphia Chapel North Wing<br/>
[[Bradford, Yorkshire, England|Bradford]] on Sunday Feb 23rd 1844; to commence at ten o'clock in the<br/>
morning two in the afternoon and six in the evening; when there will<br/>
be present on the occassion two Americans, one of whom belongs to<br/>
the quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Also there will be preaching on the <br/>
fulness of the everlasting gospel as revealed by an angel of the Lord in<br/>
these last days on the following ^evenings^ —Monday Tuesday and Wednesday<br/>
in the said chapel to commence at eight o'clock each evening. N. B.<br/>

was called to the chair and Priest [[Joseph Beecroft|Beecroft]] chosen clerk.</p>

<p>The meeting being duly opened the Conference<br/>
was represented consisting of three Branches—Bradford Leeds<br/>
and Idle numbering in the whole 168 members.</p>

<p>There was a good number of the Saints<br/>
gathered together and an excellent band of music in front of the<br/>
pulpit accompanied the singers. In the morning Elder Woodruff<br/>
addressed the meeting.</p>

<p>The chapel in the afternoon was crowded<br/>
with the Saints and citizens. Sacrament was administered<br/>
and I again addressed the congregation but was somewhat interupted<br/>
by a man intoxicated who had been cut off the Church.</p>

<p>In the evening we again had a crowded<br/>
house and the music and singing which commenced our service<br/>
was inspiring. It fell to my lot once more to address the<br/>
congregation during the evening and I took for my text the<br/>
XIV of Rev 6 7 &amp; <strike>8</strike> verses. In my discourse I gave an account of<br/>
the rise and progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day<br/>
Saints the leading mind of Joseph Smith how he was called of God<br/>
by the administration of angels and traced the subject through to<br/>
the sealing of his testimony with his blood.</p>

<p>I spoke for the space of one hour with<br/>
the power of God and the congregation as still as death and<br/>
a most intense interest prevailed. During the Conference</p>",
42658.0,107,,""">March the 1st</time> was my birthday and I was thirty eight <br/>
years of age and in Liverpool presiding over the British Mission and with me<br/>

<p><u>An Attempt to Rob the Church of the Copyright of<br/>
The Book of Doctrine and Covenants</u> +</p>

<p>On my birthday I received a letter from a friend<br/>
containing the copy of a letter dated [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] Jan 30, 1845 written by<br/>
[[John Greenhow|John Greenhow]] to his father in [[Kendal, Westmorland, England|Kendal]] stating that he was getting the<br/>
Doctrine and Covenants stereotyped in Pittsburg and that he was going to<br/>
bring the plates to [[England|England]] to print the work here and get the copyright secured<br/>
so that the Church could not print <strike>them</strike> ^it^</p>

<p>This was indeed a bold move of the apostates to<br/>
<strike>undertake to</strike> undertake to print the works of the Church and such a<br/>
book as the Doctrine and Covenants which is the second standard work of the<br/>
<strike>Church</strike> and I viewed it as nothing less than the providence of God<br/>
which ^put^ the knowledge of this design to rob the Church of the copyright<br/>
into my hand^s^. I spent the day in examining the law of <br/>
England upon the securing of copyright. +</p>

<p>I spent the forepart of the following day at<br/>
home and the afternoon with Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and [[Thomas Ward|Ward]] upon whom at this<br/>
time I laid my hands and ordained as my counsellors <strike>and they then<br/>
laid their hands upon me and blessed me</strike>. Afterwards <strike>we partook</strike><br/>
<strike>of the sacrament together and then</strike> we called upon God our Father to<br/>
bless us and frustrate the designs of our enemies and overthrow the<br/>
<strike>designs</strike> ^plans^ which they had laid to rob the Church and injure the cause</p>",
42658.0,108,,""">9th of March</time> at which myself and Elder [[Thomas Ward|Ward]]<br/>
attended. Elder [[John Banks|John Banks]] was called to the chair. During<br/>
the day Elder [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]] was chosen to preside over the<br/>
Conference and there were eleven Branches represented with 505<br/>
members.</p>

<p>Next day I took a walk through the city and<br/>
visited the old Cockpit where Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] had<br/>
preached so much at the first opening of the British mission and<br/>
where also Dr [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] afterwards <strike>also</strike> preached.</p>

<p>We walked up and down the river where<br/>
many hundred of the Saints had been baptized and I also viewed<br/>
^from where^ the Scotch made an attack upon the English at Preston when the <br/>
<strike>gallant enthusiastic</strike> <strike>followers</strike> ^army^ of the Young Pretender made ^their^ illfated<br/>
<strike>and mad</strike> attempt  to unseat the first George from the English<br/>
<strike>throne and</strike> ^Washed it the house of the Stuarts^ <strike>give it to their bonnie Charle</strike>. Some of the Scotch<br/>
entered the town as far as the Cockpit but most of them was<br/>
slain in the Valley. I saw their burial place. There is now a <br/>
grove growing over their bodies. This was in the year 1745<br/>
just one hundred years before this date.</p>

<p>We returned to the town and after dinner<br/>
I took the parting hard of Elders Banks and Hardy and the<br/>
Saints of Preston and returned to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]</p>",

Charles Wyatt]] of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and was executed in bronze by [[Richard Westmacott|Richard<br/>
Westmacott]] also of London and the pedestal of Hendal Marble by<br/>
Messrs Hetherington and Webster of Liverpool. The subscription<br/>
to build it commenced on the 15^th^ of Nov 1805 and ^was^ completed the same<br/>
year amounting to £9000 and the first stone was laid July 15th 1812.</p>

<p>The principal figure is Admiral Nelson<br/>
resting one foot on a conqured enemy and the other on a cannon his eye<br/>
stedfast and upraised to Victory from whom he is receiving a fourth<br/>
naval crown upon his swourd held in his left hand indicating the loss of<br/>
his right which is concealed by the flag which the genius of Victory<br/>
is lowering over him. Under the folds of this flag Death lies<br/>
in ambush indicating that he received the reward of Victory and the <br/>
stroke of Death at the same time. There is an enraged British<br/>
sailor represented symbolizing the zeal of the navy to revenge the loss of its<br/>
most illustrious chief and in the back ground is Britannia leaning on<br/>
her sphere and shield with lau<strike>a</strike>rral in her hand but she ^is^ regardless of them<br/>
representing the country's pride and anguish over the triumph so darly<br/>
purchased.</p>

<p>Around the upper moulding of the pedestal are<br/>
inscribed Nelson's ever memorable words—""[[England|England]] expects every man<br/>
to do his duty"". At the base of the pedestal are four figures in<br/>
chains as captives emblematical of the four great victories he achieved and<br/>
the space between these figures on the sides of the pedestal is filled by four<br/>
grand <u>bass reliefs</u> executed in bronze ^also^ representing those glorious<br/>
victories—namely, St Vincent 14 Feb. 1797; Nile 1st Aug. 1798;<br/>

<p>There was quite a collection of natural History<br/>
and three and half tons of precious books as a liberary. I saw<br/>
also a ^metal pot^ bearing this inscription: ""One Hundred and <br/>
twenty years after Christ. I belong to St. Lawrence."" I also saw<br/>
three gold and silver Roman crosses stolen by travellers from the <br/>
Vatican at Rome, 300 years old, besides a number of weapons of war<br/>
and paintings of ancient date.</p>

<p>Afterwards we called at a brothers house and I<br/>
laid hands upon six who were sick <strike>and blessed twenty persons who pled<br/>
with me to let them have a blessing under the hands of an Apostle.</strike>  I <br/>
preached in the evening to a crowded house and afterwards walked to <br/>
brother [[Mathew Carruthers|Carruthers]] and spent the night.</p>

<p><strike>I dreamt a rattlesnake bit me on the ancle but I<br/>
pulled him off squezed him to death and much poison ran out of<br/>
him. The interpretation was that when we arrived at [[Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland|Edinborough]]<br/>
I should be opposed by          for appointing<br/>
[[John Banks|John Banks]] to preside over that Branch and Conference of the<br/>
Church</strike>.</p>",
42658.0,112,,"<p>Returning to [[Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland|Glasgow]] and joining Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and<br/>
[[Thomas Ward|Ward]] we took the rail to [[Castlecary, Lanarkshire, Scotland|Castle Car<strike>e</strike>ry]] and thence by coach to [[Stirling, Stirlingshire, Scotland|Sterling]]<br/>
and as we came in sight of it among the mountains we had a fine<br/>
view of the famed Sterling Castle which brought to mind the heroic<br/>
Wallace &amp; the royal Bruce in their renowned wars to free [[Scotland|Scotland]] from<br/>
the English yoke. Sterling Castle was taken by Wallace in<br/>
one of his most famous acts</p>

<p>Arriving at Sterling we called upon<br/>
Elder [[Daniel H. Sutherland|Daniel Sutherland]] in John Street and took supper and<br/>
then called upon [[John Gillies|John Gillies]] 76 years of age. He was the third<br/>
man in the formation of the 92 Handers was in the army for<br/>
21 years and embraced the Gospel in the 73 year of his age<br/>
I had an interesting conversation with him during the evening<br/>
and we spent the night at his house</p>

<p><u>Sterling</u> <u>Castle</u>. Next morning with brothers Hedlock Ward<br/>
and Gillies we visited Sterling castle and went through every appartment<br/>
of it. As we passed up the avenue leading to the castle<br/>
we closely examined the palace of [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary Queen of Scots]] and the King's<br/>
stables and went into them!</p>

<p>In going through the old castle we saw<br/>
the armoury and old flags and many things of antiquity We <br/>
went into into the Chaple of John Knox and closely examined the oak<br/>
pulpit in which he preached and where he baptized Prince Henry<br/>
I brought away a small piece of the pulpit and stood upon the<br/>
exa<strike>t</strike>ct spot where the fierce Scotish reformer Knox stood and <br/>
preached his first sermon. Here I also saw the place in<br/>
the old church where stood the Twelve Apostles in stone figures<br/>
which Knox destroyed before commencing his sermon and fierce<br/>
denunciation against popery and image worship. We also had<br/>
a view of the habitation of the Earl of Lecester in 16^39^ and<br/>
Cemens Hospital and the place where James the VI was crowned<br/>
We had a pleasant view of Sterling Castle and the surrounding <br/>
country from its heights</p>",
42658.0,113,,"<p>While at Sterling I laid my hands upon the veteran [[John Gillies|John<br/>
Gillies]] and blessed him and ordained him an Elder and on the third day<br/>
from our arrival we took steamboat for [[Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland|Edinborough]] where we arrived at<br/>
seven oclock and after taking some refreshments at [[Henry McEwan|Henry McEwan]]'s the<br/>
Presiding Elder we went to the meeting</p>

<p>This was the first time I had ever been in Edinborough<br/>
and the Edinborough Conference of the Church was in a divided state for<br/>
many aspiring spirits were there and had been manifested for a length<br/>
of time. I prayed God to give us wisdom to set this Conference<br/>
in order.</p>

<p><u>Edinborough</u> <u>Castle.</u><br/>
Next day we viewed the renowned city of Edinborough<br/>
and visited its castle and went through each appartment of it. From the<br/>
Castle we had a splendid view of the city <strike>of Edinborugh</strike> and surrounding<br/>
country for many miles. The rock itself which forms the site of<br/>
the castle is three hundred and eighty ^3^ feet above the level of the sea and<br/>
is accessable only on the eastern side the other sides being nearly perpendicular</p>

<p>The castle is of great antiquity and has been held<br/>
as a fortress from the earliest times. In 1093 it was besieged by Donald<br/>
^Bane^ brother to King Malcolm; taken by the English in 1296, retaken and<br/>
demolished by Randolph 1313, rebuilt by Edward the III of England,<br/>
surprised by Wm. Douglas 1341, and by Albany in 1482; taken<br/>
by the Regent Murray from Mary Queen of Scots, his half sister, in 1573;<br/>
by Cromwell in 1650 and by William the III of England in 1689</p>

<p>The Scotish Regalia are kept in the castle.<br/>
They were placed there in 1707 and discovered in an o[a]ken chest in the <br/>
crown room in 1818. This is King David's crown, first King of <br/>
[[Scotland|Scotland]]</p>

<p>I also inspected the celebrated piece of artilary<br/>
called Mons Meg cast at Mons in Flanders. It was used in the<br/>
seige of Norham and afterwards burst in firing a salute to the Duke<br/>
of York on his visit to the castle in 1682. It was forged in<br/>
1486 out of large bars of iron. Its weight was seven and half tons<br/>
and it carried 268 pound shot, the bore was twenty inches and </p>",
42658.0,114,,"<p>its length fifteen feet.</p>

<p>After visiting the Armoury and going through<br/>
each appartment of the castle and taking the splendid views of <br/>
the surrounding country we left and visited other portions of the<br/>
city and among the rest saw <u>The</u> <u>old</u> <u>house</u> <u>where</u> <u>John</u><br/>
<u>Knox</u> <u>the</u> <u>Scotish</u> <u>Reformer</u> <u>was</u> <u>born</u> <u>May</u> <u>2nd</u> <u>1505</u> <u>and</u><br/>
<u>died Nov</u> <u>24, 1572</u>.</p>

<p><u>Visit to the Palace of Holyrood</u></p>

<p>We next visited the Palace of Holyrood. It occupies the<br/>
site of an Abbey which was founded by David the I. in 1128<br/>
and which was one of the ^richest religious establishments in [[Scotland|Scotland]].^</p>

<p>^In the^ chapel ^of the palace^ were deposited the remains of David II; James II; Prince<br/>
Arthur third son of James IV; James V; Magdalene his queen;<br/>
Arthur Second son of James V, and Henry Darnley. The<br/>
ruins of what is now called the Chapel Royal ^is worthy of notice.^</p>

<p>The <u>Picture</u> <u>Gallery</u> of Holyrood which<br/>
is 156 feet long by 27 1/2 wide and 20 feet in height contains<br/>
the portriats of the Scotish monarchs.</p>

<p>In the palace are preserved several relics<br/>
of the unfortunate Queen Mary of Scotts. I saw her workbox<br/>
visited her bedchamber and saw the bed and furniture and the<br/>
chair occupied by her when married and also visited her dressing<br/>
room both of which was hung with the most splendid ancient tapestry.</p>

<p>I saw the hiding palace of Lord Darnley<br/>
and his associates when they murdered David Rizzio Mary's musician<br/>
and the place where the victim fell and the stain of his blood<br/>
which yet remains. I also saw the armour worn by Lord <br/>
Darnley at the time of the murder and I put on Darnley's steal<br/>
head dress which was heavy</p>",

<p>Present: One of the Twelve Apostles 3 High Priests 8 Elders 16 Priests<br/>
and four Teachers. [[Reuben Hedlock|R. Hedlock]] was chosen President and Priest<br/>
[[Jesse Charles Braley|Braley]] Clerk</p>

<p>Conference having been opened with singing and prayer<br/>
eleven Branches were represented as the Edinborough Conference containing<br/>
409 members 13 Edlers 22 Priests 8 Teachers 1 Deacon and 9<br/>
baptized since the last Conference.</p>

<p>The morning was taken up in teaching principle<br/>
in the afternoon the Church partook of the Sacrament after which Elder [[John Banks|John<br/>
Banks]] was appointed President of the Edinborough Conference and also the<br/>
Edinborough Branch and [[Henry McEwan|Henry McEwen]] presiding Elder over two or three<br/>
Branches under Elder John Banks. In the evening I preached</p>",
42658.0,116,,"<p>to an attentive congregation.</p>

<p>A company of young men who called themselves<br/>
the Nauvoo Legion escorted us out to see the city next morning and they<br/>
led us to the very top of the high cliff known as Arthur's Seat which<br/>
was the highest peak of rocks anywhere in this region and a good part<br/>
of the way up was almost perpendicular. I was informed that<br/>
Elder [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] while he was establishing the Bra[n]ch in [[Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland|Edinborough]]<br/>
which he found about as difficult as we did the establishing of the<br/>
work in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]], would frequently go to the top of this rock as a<br/>
place of retreat and meditation.</p>

<p>From this rock we had a full view of<br/>
the whole city of Edinborough and the surrounding country which<br/>
presented to us a sublime prospect. I was quite unwell with<br/>
a severe cold and and felt wearied in reaching the top of this rock<br/>
or Arthours Seat which was also the case with the rest of the brethren<br/>
as far as fatigue was concerned</p>

<p>When we had sufficiently viewed the<br/>
country around we returned took dinner and then visited several<br/>
of the Saints and in the evening we held a council meeting<br/>
of the officers.</p>

<p>The day after we parted with the Saints <br/>
in Edinborough took the rail to [[Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland|Glasgow]] where we spent 3 hours<br/>
with the brethren then continued by rail to [[Greenock, Renfrewshire, Scotland|Grenock]] and<br/>
thence by steamboat for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]. Elder [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and<br/>
myself were together; brother [[Thomas Ward|Ward]] had been left in Edinborough<br/>
by accident</p>

<p>We had a disgreaable night on board and<br/>
I arrived in Liverpool sick and weary and for several day continued<br/>
unwell and mostly unfit for business</p>

<p>On my return I received several <strike>of</strike><br/>
numbers of the Times and Seasons and Neighbour and<br/>
the New York Prophet also a letter from Elder [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>

<p>This was our yearly General Conference of the various<br/>
Conferences of the Church throughout the United Kingdom of<br/>
[[Great Britain|Great Britain]] and which was held as in America on the anaversary<br/>
of the rise of the Church</p>

<p>A large assembly of Saints and friends<br/>
came together at an early hour. Elder Woodruff presided<br/>
supported by his counsellors [[Reuben Hedlock|Reuben Hedlock]] and [[Thomas Ward|Tho<sup>s</sup> Ward]].</p>

<p>After the Conference was duly opened the<br/>
President called upon the delegates to represent the various conferences<br/>
of the British Mission which occupied the forenoon. It was<br/>
much the largest representation ever given in England up to this<br/>
date notwithstanding our emigrations.</p>

<p>The afternoon was occupied by the Delegates<br/>
in representing the condition of their Conferences and the evening<br/>
was spent in the same manner and the Hall was filled with<br/>
a large assembly.</p>

<p>At the close of the evening I occupied<br/>
a few moments as delegate from America in representing<br/>
my Conference consisting of the United States containing</p>",
42658.0,119,,"<p>one Quorum of the Twelve Apostles one High Council, 300 High Priests,<br/>
1050 of the Seventies 5000 Elders and about the same number of Priests Teachers<br/>
and Deacons and about one hundred thousand members including the<br/>
officers generally in very good standing, having built several towns and<br/>
one city with a population of 15,000 souls, built two Temples and laid<br/>
the foundation of another suffered much persecution and 50 or more of<br/>
its members had sealed their testimony with their blood but still it was in<br/>
a good state of prosperity.</p>

<p>General Conference re-assembled next morning at 10<br/>
o'clock at Mr Haywood's Room the usual meeting place of the Church at<br/>
[[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and the first business presented was the Joint Stock Company<br/>
A committee of ten was chosen to withdraw from the body of the<br/>
Conference and form an instrument in writing as a Constitution for the<br/>
society.</p>

<p>The Committee of the Joint Stock Company<br/>
accordingly withdrew and sat in Council most of the time for 24<br/>
hours and while that was going on the President and his counsellors<br/>
continued the business of the General Conference in making changes<br/>
of Elders giving appointments settling difficulties and putting<br/>
things generally in order</p>

<p>The two last days of the conference was occupied<br/>
mostly with the business of the Joint Stock Company and at the close Elders<br/>
[[Elisha Hildebrand Davis|Elisha H Davis]] &amp; [[Elijah Funk Sheets|Elijah F. Sheets]] were ordained into the quorum of the Seventies<br/>
and [[Thomas Dunlop Brown|T. D. Brown]] to the office of Elder under the hands of Elders Woodruff<br/>

42658.0,120,,""">23<sup><u>rd</u></sup></time> at the Office examining the<br/>
and aranging the trunk and relics of our departed friend and brother<br/>
[[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Lorenzo D. Barnes]]. I carefully filed all his corresepondence and packed<br/>
in his trunk together with his own compositions Journals Patriarchal<br/>
Blessings &amp;c also a dozen or more of choice coin of ancient date and<br/>
characters which he probably collected for the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Museum<br/>
with one weight the standard for a sovereign and his finger ring all<br/>
of which I carefully put in a package and sealed it with wax and<br/>
stamped it with a large seal.</p>

<p>Upon the outside<br/>
of this package I wrote the contents and directed it to the<br/>
President of the Church in Nauvoo. Besides this I packed<br/>
his carpet bag a splendid Buffalo robe worked with Indian beads<br/>
overcoat dress coat various other clothing 2 cases of razors two</p>",
42658.0,121,,"<p>pocket books containing deeds of land and other papers a crown piece in a small<br/>
pocket book for the Museum at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and a variety of other things all of which<br/>
I carefully packed to be sent to Nauvoo</p>

<p>A Dream.</p>

<p>After retiring to rest this night I fell asleep and dreamt that I<br/>
had just returned to Nauvoo from my English mission and was in company<br/>
with a number of the Twelve and other brethren. We met with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
the Prophet and I shook hands with him and asked him if he and his<br/>
family were well. He said they were. I thought the endowment<br/>
had been given and he was counselling us about taking a mission<br/>
abroad. While talking he sat in a chair and leaned upon his breast<br/>
He said he was going to take a mission to [[India|India]] and pointed out the<br/>
man to go with him but I cannot now call him by name. [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A. Smith]] asked liberty of Joseph to spend more time with me that<br/>
we might be prepared to take a mission together which was granted<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] had his mission appointed but I do not know where;<br/>
[[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] was spoken of but I do not recollect what was said.<br/>
We had an interesting time together and all seamed happy to<br/>
see the Prophet again.</p>

<p>[FIGURE]<br/>
Tomb Stone of [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Lorenzo D Barnes]]</p>

<p>I sent to Elder [[Elijah Funk Sheets|E. F. Sheets]] the following epitah for the<br/>
tombstone:<br/>
""In memory of Lorenzo D. Barnes who died on the<br/>
20th of December 1842 aged 30 years. He was a native of the<br/>
United States an Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter<br/>
Day Saints a member of the High Priest Quorum and also of<br/>
Zions Camp in A.D. 1834 and the first Gospel Messenger<br/>
from Nauvoo who has found a grave in a foreign land.</p>",

The conquered tomb shall yeild her captive prey<br/>
Then with thy Quorum shaL thou reign in bliss<br/>
As King and Priest for an eternal day.</p>

<p>The same evening I rode to Newton in company<br/>
with Bro [[James Ferguson|James Ferguson]] and here I stayed with that Branch of<br/>
Saints for several days.</p>

<p>During my stay at Newton I with several<br/>
friends went to see the Muspratt Vitrol works carried on in<br/>
their various branches. It is one of the most lucrative businesses<br/>
in the world but very disagreeable and unhealthy. The fires are<br/>
fed with brimstone and the smoke of the whole works is carried<br/>
off through a brick chimney 138 feet in circumferance and 396<br/>
in height and often the air is so impregnated in the dirrection<br/>
that the smoke goes even at a great distance that one can<br/>
only with difficulty breathe in it.</p>

<p>After leaving these works I visited each<br/>
appartment of the Newton Engine factory where a large number<br/>
of engines are made for the railroad. We have several of the<br/>
brethren at work there who could carry on the business in all its branches</p>

<p>From the Newton Engine Factory I<br/>
walked several miles through a very pleasant scenery surrounded<br/>
with green fields hedges trees and gardens and visited the Church. On<br/>
the side of the building was the figure of a pig in stone with<br/>
a stone hung around its neck. The tradition is that the materials<br/>
for the Church was drawn to another place quite a distance<br/>
from where the Church now stands and the pig came along and<br/>
took a stone in his mouth and carried it along squeeling and<br/>
laid it down where the Church now stands. The people<br/>
took it as an omen that they should build the Church there<br/>
and they did.</p>

<p>I returned from my walk to Bro [[John Nuttall|Nuttall]]'s</p>",
42658.0,123,,""">5</time>th<br/>
I walked from the latter place to [[Whalley, Lancashire, England|Whalley]] and visited its old Abbey<br/>
which was the largest I had ever been into. It covered several acres<br/>
of ground &amp; was nearly in total ruins except a small portion of it<br/>
which is inhabited by a few families. The Abbey is 800 years<br/>
old and was built A.D. 1,000.</p>

<p><u>Stoneyhurst</u>—<u>The</u> <u>Jesuits</u> <u>College</u></p>

<p>Next day Brother Speakman and myself walked to<br/>
Stoneyhurst and went through every appartment of the <u>Jesuits</u><br/>
<u>College</u> which was the only college of the kind in [[England|England]]<br/>
We inspected each department of the rare and splendid paintings<br/>
and of the library which was very extensive containing many<br/>
very ancient writings and parchment manuscripts. There<br/>
was the prayer book of Mary Queen of England and a copy<br/>
of St. [[Paul (NT)|Paul]]'s Epistles one thousand years old. We went<br/>
through their museum studies lodgings chapels &amp;c containing<br/>
many rare and curious things. There were many paintings<br/>
and figures of Christ and some of the images of the Saviour<br/>
on the cross in fine marble cost £700. We went into<br/>
the chapel of the boys educated there and also into the main<br/>
chapel one of the windows of which with the paintings of the<br/>
Twelve Apostles on it cost two thousand pounds and<br/>
the candlesticks crosses and all the furnature were very choice<br/>
and costly.</p>

<p>We visited each <strike>appartmant</strike> part of the gardans which wer devided<br/>
by walks bordered by the ewe tree which formed the whole into departments. This<br/>
ewe tree border was about 4 feet thick 12 feet high and from 40 to 200 feet long<br/>
varying in the departments and these borders were as straight and smooth as a<br/>
plastered wall</p>",
42658.0,124,,"<p>After going through this noted College and its gardens<br/>
we walked to [[Waddington, Lancashire, England|Waddington]] and visited the Almshouses built and<br/>
dedicated by Sir [[Robert Parker, b. 1633|Robert Parker]] in 1,700. to the poor widows of<br/>
the parish. There were twentyfive dwellings and a small<br/>
garden to each. These houses were occupied by aged widows<br/>
the youngest of whom was sixty years of age and the oldest<br/>
87. They appeared quite comfortable. We stoped at Waddington for the night.</p>

<p>[FIGURE]<br/>
Thence next day to [[Clitheroe, Lancashire, England|Clithero]] then to<br/>
[[Chatburn, Lancashire, England|Chatburn]] and we walked through the street that the Apostle<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] walked through with his hat off and<br/>
blessed the place. I felt the Spirit of God rest upon me<br/>
while walking over the same road.</p>

<p>^<u>A</u> <u>Day</u> <u>at </u><u>Fishing</u>^ I went fishing the following day<br/>
with Father [[Richard Smithies|Richard Smithies]] in the river Ribble. He was<br/>
70 years of age and ^was^ considered the greatest fisher^man^ in that country<br/>
He fished with the fly and it being the first time I had ever<br/>
witnessed it I was delighted with this ingenious art of fishing and<br/>
the dexterity of the fisherman. The fishing rod was about<br/>
14 feet long very slender and his long fine line made of hair and<br/>
catgut was wound round a small brass wheel with a little crank to it<br/>
and fastened to the but end of the pole. The line then runs through<br/>
half a dozen brass rings or ilot holes fastened at regular distances<br/>
along the rod to the small end of it. On the line are<br/>
five or six artificial flies about two feet apart fastened by<br/>
catgut almost as fine as a hair. Twenty or thirty feet of the<br/>
line is unwound from the reel at the but of the rod and thrown<br/>
upon the water and the fly hooks swim down the stream and<br/>
the trout th^aking^ them as natural flies are hooked as<br/>
soon as they bite. If they are large trout and run, they<br/>
of themselves unwind as much line as they want from the<br/>
reel and when the fish are thus worried in the water until they<br/>
struggle no longer the fisherman draws them to the bank<br/>
by the line or to himself if he stands in the water and</p>",

42658.0,126,,"<p>painted from stern to stem and one could not touch ^or sit^ anywhere without carrying<br/>
away the paint my last resort was to pay 2 shillings for the use of a<br/>
bunk among the Sailors. I had no sooner gone below than I was<br/>
enveloped in the most horrid stench I ever smelt arising from the<br/>
cargo consisting of <u>guano</u>. I laid down but was as sick as death<br/>
and vomitted at intervals for five hours and my stomach being empty<br/>
I strained at such a degree that blood ran out of my nose almost<br/>
a stream. I suffered much through the night and the sailors<br/>
smoked their pipes and filled the place with tobaco smoke which<br/>
though nacious to me was better than the stench of the cargo. I<br/>
thought it the most horrid night I ever spent at sea.</p>

<p>We arrived at [[Port Carlisle, Cumberland, England|Port Carlisle]] at 9 o'clock in<br/>
the morning. I then crossed the ferry and took the canal boat to<br/>
[[Carlisle, Cumberland, England|Carlisle]].</p>

<p>With brothers Kent and [[James Allen|Allen]] the next<br/>
day I went through the town of Carlisle. It was anciently walled<br/>
in with a high strong wall most of which was taken down in<br/>
building the city. We walked upon some portion of the<br/>
walls which still stood and visited the old St. Marys Church and<br/>
Abbey about eleven hundred years of age. Portions of the Church<br/>
was the ancient building itself and the remainder had been prepainted<br/>
We also visited the Carlisle castle which gave us a fair view of<br/>
the surrounding country and among other things of note with which<br/>
we made ourselves acquainted was a very valuable painting by<br/>
<u>Edward</u> <u>Rancier</u> which we saw at Mr [[Charles Thurnum|Charles Thurnum]]'s<br/>
Stationer's Shop. It represented a blacksmith in the act of<br/>
shoeing a bay horse with a donkey by his side and a dog sitting<br/>
on the ground with the tool box anvil tools &amp;c scattered around<br/>
It was such a life picture that it seemed more than a mere<br/>
painting. Five thousand pounds had frequently been offered<br/>
for it and refused. They sold the engravings for 5 pounds<br/>
each and it was supposed that no living artist except<br/>
<u>Rancier</u> could paint such a picture.</p>",

<p>This conference had not met before for 4 years and<br/>
as it was somewhat a special meeting now Elder Woodruff was called to<br/>
the chair and [[Joseph Maughen|Joseph Maughen]] clerk.</p>

[[Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland|Dunfries]] and containing 165 members</p>

<p>The necessary business in putting the Churches<br/>
in order was attended to sacrament partaken of and in the evening<br/>
the president of the meeting preached to a crowded house upon the rise<br/>
and progress of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints<br/>
which closed the conference</p>

<p>I parted from the Saints of Carlisle and<br/>
returned to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] by the same steamer in which I came. It had<br/>
on board 400 sheep and some horses and cattle which nearly covered the entire<br/>
deck yet the sailors found space large enough to fight on. About<br/>
a dozen of them got at it which left many bloody noses and sore heads<br/>
We had a very good passage however.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May which was the seventh day of the week and on this the Sabbath day of ancient Israel<br/>
at 6 o'clock in the morning the last stone was laid on the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]<br/>

<p>I spent several weeks in London and while<br/>
there the case of Elder [[James Albon|Albon]] was before the Church. He was the<br/>
minister of the Indipendant Connection whom we baptized at<br/>
the commencement of the work in London on my former mission<br/>
to England. He was brought to trial for resisting the order<br/>
and counsel of the Church and at a meeting on the 19th of<br/>
June when his case was brought up for the last time for<br/>
settlement he defended himself with a heart full of envy and<br/>
accusation but acknowledged what was brought against him</p>",
42658.0,129,,"<p>and said that [[James Albon|he]] should continue his course baptizing on and<br/>
ordaining in his own way. A vote was taken and he was cut<br/>
off from the Church a second time.</p>

<p>While in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] on this occassion I also revisited<br/>
many of the noted places and things of the city and subburbs and saw<br/>
some alterations and additions but the most famous of the fresh things<br/>
which I saw and which I had never visited before was</p>

<p>[FIGURE]<br/>
The Unrivalled Exhibition of Madame [[Anna Maria Grosholtz Tussaud|Tussaud]]<br/>
and Sons<br/>
<u>Bazar Becker Street Portman Square</u></p>

<p>I have never in my travels seen anything which could<br/>
begin to compare with this exhibition. On entering I purchassed a<br/>
book of the contents of each room. Here were life representations<br/>
of the kings and queens of [[England|England]] for centuries with their courts at various<br/>
periods, also the kings and emperors of other nations of [[Europe|Europe]] with<br/>
a grand marshalling of celebrated poets orators and renowned men<br/>
of the earth with the due proportion of unenviable notorious characters<br/>
Among the rest stood our own [[George Washington|Washington]] in his dress of state and<br/>
Byron [[William Shakespeare|Shakspeare]] Voltaire Luther Calvin [[John Knox|Knox]] Wesley and<br/>
a host of like celebrities. And what makes the exhibition so<br/>
interesting is the fact that we find there not only the best possible<br/>
representations of the persons of the grand array of famous characters<br/>
but also the very dresses &amp;c which they wore in life even to the<br/>
coronation robes of royalty with their diamonds stars precious stones<br/>
and all the gorgeous paraphernalia of everything famous in the<br/>
present and past. Here is Napoleon the 1st represented under<br/>
almost every circumstance of his life and the Sleeping Beauty<br/>
of [[France|France]] with her jewels and necklace of brilliants with her<br/>
bosom heaving with the soft regular breathing of sleep looking as natural<br/>
as life as does ^also^ the other figures. Indeed to such an extent</p>",
42658.0,130,,"<p>is this life like illusion sustained everwhere in this famous Bazaar that<br/>
visitors often find the novelty of taking these wax figures for living<br/>
persons. I myself was in one case particularly taken in with<br/>
the apparant life reality of a respectable old gentleman ^setting^ by my<br/>
side. The following is an extract of some of some of the<br/>
personages and things which I saw at the Bazaar of Madame<br/>

sons of peers. The robe on the right under the looking glass was used<br/>
at the opening of Parliament that on the left was the purple or imperial<br/>

of Russia offering on behalf of the Allied monarchs the Kingdom of France. The<br/>
intention of this group is to show ^in view^ the principal actors in a which never had<br/>
a parallel and to give effect to the view the allied monarchs are supposed<br/>
to be offering to Napoleon the kingdom of France as it was under Louis XIV<br/>
(an historical fact) which he refused prefering to risk the chance of war<br/>
against Europe in arms rather than give up his pretentions to universal<br/>
dominion. Napoleon, grasping the sword which won him empire points<br/>
to his favorite Eagle and and determines to fulfil his destiny. The<br/>
Eagle surmounting the whole was presented by Napoleon to his Imperial<br/>
Guard and was taken at Waterloo by the Prussians <strike> under <u>Von</u></strike> ^Blucher^<br/>

<p><u>Relics</u> <u>of</u> <u>Napoleon</u></p>

<p>The celebrated and identical camp-bed used by Napoleon 7 years<br/>
at St. Hellena with the original mattress and pillows on<br/>
which he died. Here ^he^ is lying in state in his chasseur uniform<br/>
covered with the identical cloak worn by him at Marengo<br/>
and prized so highly that he expressly left it by will to his<br/>
son the King of Rome. In it he laid in soldier's glory and<br/>
it served as his pall to the grave. They paid for the bed<br/>
alone £550 for the Tussaud Bazaar. Here is the<br/>
coronation robe of Napoleon and also the coronation robe of<br/>
the Empress Josephine the train of which at her coronation was<br/>
borne by four queens. A figure of Napoleon in the identical<br/>
clothes worn by him ^at^ St. Hellena, waistcoast smallclothes stockings<br/>
morning gown and sword belt. The celebrated flag of Elba which<br/>
Napoleon presented to the National guards at Elba afterwards<br/>
used by him on his return to France. It was again presented<br/>
to his guard before the battle of Waterloo and was taken by<br/>
the Prussians. This flag accompanied Napoleon in the most<br/>
interesting portion of his marvellous history. There were figures<br/>
of Josephine in her Imperia costume Prince Lucien The<br/>
King of Rome Madame Mere Napoleon's mother his<br/>
sister the wife of Murat and Queen of Naples and Napoleon<br/>
crossing the Alps. In this room Napoleon is represented</p>",
42658.0,135,,"<p>under four phases—as a general a the E^m^peror as the Exile and lastly<br/>
in death. One of the most famous of the Napoleonic relics is<br/>
the carriage of Napoleon in which he made the campaign of<br/>
Russia and which was captured on the eve of the battle of Waterloo<br/>
and sent with the officer who took it to the Regent of England from<br/>
whom it was purchased for 2,500. It accompanied the Emperor in<br/>
many of his campaigns and was used by him as sovereign of Elba<br/>
It was constructed so as to make good accomodations for riding sleeping<br/>
writing eating storing arms &amp;c. I sat in this carriage in which<br/>
the great Napoleon had sat so many anxious hours and from which<br/>
he gave command in his final battle—Waterloo. There was<br/>
also the identical sword worn by him during his campaign in<br/>
Egypt and a host of other relics but probably the most curious<br/>
relic is the counterpane used on the camp-bed on which Napoleon<br/>
died, <u>marked</u> with his <u>blood</u></p>

<p>Chamber of Horrors</p>

<p><u>Full</u><u> figures</u>: Count De Lo<strike>n</strike>rge as in prison in the Bastile—Marat<br/>

<p>[[Leamington, Warwickshire, England|Lemington]] is one of the first aristocratic towns in<br/>
[[England|England]] which the Nobility and gentry visit as one of their select places<br/>
and in consequence of its sulphur springs. The streets and buildings<br/>
of the town are rich and splendid in appearance.</p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Visit</u> <u>to</u> <u>[[Warwick Castle, Warwick, Warwickshire, England|Warwich]]</u> <u>Castle</u></p>

<p>In company of about a dozen Saints I visited<br/>
the Warwic<strike>h</strike>k castle and tower. It is considered the most splendid<br/>
castle in England and is furnished with all the magnificence which art<br/>
and the wealth of Earldom could bestow upon it.</p>

<p>The main body of the castle was 333 ft<br/>
long divided into its various rooms. The walls were hung with rich<br/>
gorgeous tapestry the rooms furnished with the costliest furniture<br/>
and the richest damask-covered chairs tables and stands inlaid<br/>
with pearl shell and precious stones. Some of these articles cost<br/>
£15,000 each and would take three years for the artizen to make.</p>

<p>This castle contained a great variety of<br/>
Paintings and portraits of Kings Queens Lords Orators Reformers<br/>
and nobles. One among the gallery of portraits was the founder of <br/>
the Jesuits.</p>

<p>From the windows of the castle we looked<br/>
out upon stately ceders of Lebanon oak firs and other shrubs and<br/>
saw the pleasure grounds of forty acres and a park five miles in<br/>
circumferance: This castle was 800 years old and the Tower<br/>
500 years old and 150 feet high. We went to the top of it and had a<br/>
magnificient view of all the surrounding country.</p>

<p>In a small room at the entrance of the<br/>
castle we had a view of the armoury of the celebrated Guy<br/>
His helmet breastplate and shield weighs 120 pounds and his <br/>
sword 20 lbs. His copper porage pot holds 120 gallons and<br/>
six grown persons of us sat in it at the same time.</p>",
42658.0,139,,"<p>In the evening I took the train in company with Elder<br/>
[[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and rode to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]. On our arrival we found Elder [[Robert Crook|Crook]]<br/>
waiting for us. We accompanied him to the Hall of the Latter-day<br/>
Saints where we found between 4 and 5 hundred of the Saints sitting<br/>
at a general tea table. As we entered the door the clapping of<br/>
hands and stomping of feet that welcomed us made the room tremble<br/>
and it was with difficulty that I could get to the stand and all wished to<br/>
shake hands with me as I passed along.</p>

<p>After taking a repast with this warm hearted<br/>
band of brethren and sisters I addressed them for about the space of<br/>
an hour clothed with the Spirit and power of God. I was followed by<br/>
Elder Hedlock and we spent a good time together.</p>

<p>Next day I left Birmingham for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]</p>

<p>On the 14th and 15th of the month in Liverpool I sat<br/>
with the board of Directors of the British and American Joint Stock<br/>
Company until near midnight of the second day. It was a hard day's<br/>
work and a critical one. Each article of the deed for settlement<br/>
preparing for regestration was read over several times changed and<br/>
altered as the Board of Directors thought fit.</p>

<p>It had been with much labour care and<br/>
expence to get this Joint Stock Company settled so as to begin to<br/>
do business and during the day I had many trying things to<br/>
encounter. My spirit was greived and insulted as it had been many<br/>
times since I came to Liverpool from a source that I ought<br/>
to have expected better things.</p>

<p>We got the Nauvoo Times and Neighbor<br/>
and New York Messenger informing us of the commencing of mobing<br/>
once more in [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]]. The mob had burned 42 houses<br/>
of the Saints in [[Lima, Adams County, Illinois|Lima]]; and a day or two later the Liverpool<br/>
papers teemed with rumours that mobs were raging against<br/>
the Saints in Hancock Co. had burned severed hundred of their<br/>
houses and that a proposition had been made by the Twelve<br/>
to the citizens of <strike>Hancock County for the Mormons to leave</strike> ^that they would leave the State as soon as they could dispose of their property^</p>",

On the 24th I met with Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and [[Thomas Ward|Ward]]<br/>
and laid before them my feelings concerning our situation in<br/>
[[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] both temporally and spiritually. There had not<br/>
been a good understanding between us for some time but I told<br/>
these brethren what I wished to be done and seemingly our<br/>
meeting was profitable and at the close of our consultation we<br/>
bowed our knees together before God.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of the follow[ing] <br/>
month I received intelligence from President [[Brigham Young|Young]] that<br/>
the State of [[Illinois|Illinois]] would not protect the citizens of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
and that the only terms of peace granted at all was upon condition<br/>
of our people leaving the State. The Presidency of the Church and<br/>
the community themselves had been under the necessity of agreeing<br/>
to leave the State of Illinois the next Spring. I wrote in <br/>
return to President Young expressing my feelings severely upon<br/>
this extermination of the Saints and asked his counsel whether<br/>
I should tarry in [[England|England]] or return to America. I also sent<br/>
him a duplicate of the entering of the copyright of the</p>",

<p>The Conferences of the British Mission were represented<br/>
containing a total of eleven thousand and thirty two members<br/>
with one of the quorum of the Twelve 8 High Priests 392 Elders<br/>
590 Priests 311 Teachers and 188 Deacons and 1573 baptized during<br/>
the last eight months. The statistics of the [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]]<br/>

<p>Thus had the work of God in ^the^ [[British Isles|British<br/>

<p>This Special Conference was continued<br/>
through two days and much important business was taken up<br/>
and arrangements made in view of my return to the United States<br/>
<strike>and</strike> ^and^ the emigration expulsion of the Saints and the general affairs of<br/>

their own to do that they had done but little to help me in the<br/>

put off by them to the last minute. This made it very hard <br/>
for me. I had to pull along alone and none to help and Elder<br/>

with them for a season, it created much excitement. <br/>
I had appointments out for a week, which I got Bro. <br/>
[[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] to fill. I went before the Lord in prayer and <br/>
asked him where I should go, the Spirit said, go to the <br/>
south. According to the directions of the Spirit, on the <br/>
3rd <strike>March</strike> I went to [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], and called upon<br/>
[[John Benbow|John Benbow]] at [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castlefroom]]; <strike>here</strike> I found a people <br/>
prepared for the Gospel. I preached twice at his house. <br/>
On the 6<u>th</u> I baptized 6 persons including John Benbow <br/>
and [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]]. I here found a society called ""United <br/>
Brethren,"" numbering about six hundred members, <br/>
and about 50 preachers, [[Thomas Kington|Tho<sup><u>s</u></sup>. Kington]] was the presiding Elder; <br/>
they came from all quarters to hear me preach and <br/>
believed my testimony and I preached and baptized <br/>
daily; the Ministers of the Church of England sent three <br/>
church clerks to see what I was doing and I baptized <br/>
them. One constable came to arrest me for preaching, and <br/>
I baptized him. In about 30 days <strike>days</strike> I baptized 160, <br/>
forty eight of <strike>which</strike> ^whom^ were preachers of the United <br/>
Brethren including their presiding Elder, Thomas <br/>
Kington.</p>

<br/>
<p>I established forty two preaching places licensed <br/>
according to law.</p>

<br/>
<p>On the 9th April I had an appointment at [[Hawcross, Redmarley D|Haw<br/>

into my hands from Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and others <br/>
informing me of his arrival with five of the Twelve,<br/>
and requested me to come to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], and attend a <br/>
general conference,— a vast assembly had gathered <strike>at</strike><br/>
to attend my meeting, the house, yard and street <br/>

to the people, five came forward <strike>and wished</strike> to be baptized</p>

dismissed the meeting and went away, but the congregation <br/>
and mob remained on the ground till midnight, and <br/>
as there was no prospect of their dispersing and the candidates <br/>
were anxious to be baptized, I went down in to the water <br/>
and baptized five in the mist of a shower of stones,<br/>
the water was all in a foam for a rod around me,<br/>
none that I baptized were hit, and I was only hit <br/>
twice, once on my hip and once on my head, the <s>one</s> ^blow^ on <br/>
my head raised a large bump, <strike>it</strike> which went away while<br/>
I was confirming: <s>S</s>^s^ubsequently I baptized many of the mob.</p>

<p><strike>Subsequently</strike> I left next morning for [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] and attended <br/>
the conference with the Twelve, and returned to [[Herefordshire, England|Hereforshire]]<br/>

bro. [[James Williams|James Williams]] in [[Iowa|Iowa]], to camp for the night; I tied my mules to a<br/>
large oak tree several rods from the carriage; as we were about to lay down<br/>
in the carriage for the night, I was strongly impressed to go and move my<br/>
mules from the oak tree, and also to move my carriage; I followed the<br/>
dictates of the Spirit, and removed my mules to a small hickory grove,<br/>
also moved my carriage several rods, and retired to rest.</p>

<p><u>Man</u> <u>Overboard</u></p>

<p>About a week after we set sail during a <br/>
<strike>roughish day</strike> ^storm^ the second mate steped forward to the bow<br/>
of the ship and ordered one of the hands to do something on<br/>
the bowsprit who refused upon the plea that it was<br/>
dangerous and at the risk of his life. The mate replied<br/>
that he would not ask a man to do a thing he was not<br/>
willing to do himself and forthwith attempted the task<br/>
At the same moment we shipped a sea which instantly</p>",
42658.0,147,,"<p>washed him overboard. The cry of second mate overboard immediately<br/>
rang through the ship and ropes were thrown out to him but he<br/>
could not get them. The buoy was next flung to him and he swam<br/>
hard to reach it but could not as the sea was running so high it<br/>
floated to the leeward of him. The captain then gave orders to ^bout^<br/>
<strike>the</strike> ship which was going 8 knotts an hour. This was done as spedily<br/>
as possible still it took several minutes to accomplish. The<br/>
Life boat was <strike>then</strike> ^let^ down at the same time and Harry the boatswain<br/>
and four other hands maned it. Notwithstanding the high seas<br/>
they managed the boat well. The second mate continued to swim<br/>
for 15 or twenty minutes in the raging billows even until the<br/>
Life boat was within a few rods of him when he instantly sunk<br/>
to rise no more. They remained on or near the spot where<br/>
he was last seen—both the ship and the boat—but nothing more was<br/>
seen of him. The boat then came along-side but it was with <br/>
great difficulty they put on board the ship and they came near being<br/>
swamped several times</p>

<p>After every exertion had been made they were<br/>
oblidg[ed] to trim the sails to the wind and continue their course<br/>
leaving the unfortunate mate in his watery grave. The Captain<br/>
and crew seemed much affected by the event.</p>

<p>The name of the second mate was [[William Drummond|William <br/>
Drummond]] an American native of <strike>floshing</strike> ^[[Flushing, New York City, Queens County, New York|Flushing]]^ Long Island New York<br/>
He was a single man had been in the East Indian trade with our<br/>
Captain [[William Howland|William Holland]]. This was his first trip in the Liverpool<br/>
trade and he was now on his return home. He was a stirring<br/>
ambitious young man and it was remarkable with what pleasure<br/>
the night before he spoke of taking tea with his mother on his arrval<br/>
home. But in the midst of his young ambitious hopeful<br/>
life he was suddenly in death burried in his watery grave</p>

<p>Harry the boatsman took the place <br/>
of the unfortunate secondmate and soon the ship's company<br/>
was sailing on as though nothing had happened. </p>",

<p>While on our voyage Elder [[Joseph Albert Stratton|Stratten]] related to me<br/>
the following narative</p>

<p><strike>I</strike> ^""^<strike>i</strike>In company with some friends on the 22nd of<br/>
October 1845 I went to visit a young maiden who was in a ^kind^ <br/>
^of^ trance. She was the daughter of [[James Comer|James]] and [[Susan Comer|Susan Corner]] ^Comer^<br/>
and her own name was [[Ann Comer|Ann <strike>Corner</strike>]] ^Commer^. Her parents lived at<br/>
the village of [[Farrington Gurney, Somerset, England|Farrington Gurney]] Sommersertshire England; and <br/>
the village is 12 miles from [[Bath, Somerset, England|Bath]] and 15 from [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]].<br/>
Ann was a sprightly child until the age of 12 years at<br/>
which time she was take[n] with convulsions and fits for five weeks<br/>
Her jaws became locked and eyes closed; she lost the use of her<br/>
limbs and was only able to turn her head and raise her hand a few<br/>
inches. The last article of food she was ever known to eat was<br/>
a small portion of an egg. This was upwards of eight years<br/>
ago during which time there has nothing entered her mouth<br/>
or passed from her. She breaths through her nose with<br/>
regular breathing and her pulse also beats regularly though<br/>
quite feble. She has grown about 2 inches in height during<br/>
this state looks very pleasant and has a smile upon her<br/>
countenance. It is the oppnion [opinion] of some that she is not<br/>
insensible and as incredible as the case may seem I could<br/>
not find a doubt among any one in the neighbourhood of the<br/>
correctness of the statement given me. I pressed her hand<br/>
several times and received a light pressure in return. Her<br/>
fingure nails have come off three times during the eight<br/>
years but at the present time they are perfect. Many<br/>
of the first Physicians in Bath have visited her and<br/>
some have spent three or four days at a time with her<br/>
They have desired to have her removed to the Hospital<br/>
but her parents will not alow it and as much as possible</p>",

<p>After a very long ^stormy^ and fatiguing passage of ^43^<br/>
days we landed on my native shore thankful enough once<br/>
more to put our feet</p>

<p>As soon as we landed brother [[Joseph Albert Stratton|Stratton]] Mr<br/>
[[John Hastings|Hastings]] and myself went to an eating house and got a <strike>bo</strike> ^dish^<br/>
of oysters which we relished very much after so long a trip and <br/>
the exhausted ship's fare; but we were more reconcilled to our<br/>
hard passage when we found that other ships had passed<br/>
quite as long and hard a voyage as ourselves that trys some of<br/>
them coming in dismasted and all had suffered much</p>

<p>Elder Stratton started for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and <br/>
I to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] my native place to take my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and<br/>
[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-mother]] with me to Nauvoo and thence to find a new<br/>
home with the Saints in their exodus to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]]<br/>
I reached Farmington on the 11th found all matters concerning<br/>
my father and mother <strike>as I</strike> ^according^ to my expectations but<br/>
my Aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna Cossett]] had died which broke up <strike>the</strike> ^her^<br/>
family. Her daughter [[Anna Cossett|Ann]] was going into a factory [[Cyrus Cossett|Cyrus]]<br/>
to [[Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|Canton]] in the blacksmith business which left my<br/>
cousin [[Betsey Cossett Alvord|Betsey]] alone and she desired to go with my<br/>
fathers family and the Saints</p>

<p>Leaving Farmington for a season I<br/>
started for my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife's]] [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father]]'s to fetch my daughter [[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe]]<br/>
whom I found a large fleshy girl.</p>

<p>I reached [[Saco, York County, Maine|Saco]] on the 17th and called<br/>
upon my wifes [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|sister]] whom I found in good health faith<br/>
and spirits and with her [[Phebe Carter Foss Sessions|Phebe]] her daughter and my child<br/>
Phebe whom I soon caught in my arms and kissed</p>",
42658.0,150,,"<p>I took dinner with my sister-in-law [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|^Sarah^<br/>
Foss]] and then went with her to Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]] in a wagon.<br/>
I found my wife's father well and the rest of the family excepting<br/>
[[Mary Fabyan Carter|Mary]] whom I thought had somewhat failed since I last saw<br/>
her. With my father-in-law and others of the family I spent the<br/>
night at his house. He told me that the spirit of [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|mother]]<br/>
<strike>did often at night visit him.</strike> ^visited him almost evey night.^</p>

<p>My wife had given me as her last request<br/>
that her father should be baptized and receive the Priesthood at<br/>
my hands before I left him and thus I communicated to<br/>
him. He said that he had desired at times to be baptized <br/>
and thought he would at this time if I stayed over another<br/>
day but next morning he was reluctant as the water<br/>
was frozen &amp;c so I thought it best to start on my journey<br/>
that day as I was so late in the season and our people had<br/>
to leave [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] that Spring</p>

<p>Father Carter was 73 years of age that<br/>
very day. Before I bade him farewell we visited together<br/>
mother's grave walking on the crust of snow that covered<br/>
the ground but her grave was bare. The old man<br/>
pointed to a spot beside it and said ""that place will<br/>
soon be my bed."" I took some pebbles from the grave<br/>
to carry to [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]].</p>

<p>At our parting our aged father<br/>
was much affected and wept. He sent his best parental<br/>
love to his daughter and wished me to say to her that he <br/>
was a firm beleive<strike>d</strike>r in the Book of Mormon and the<br/>
faith of the Latter-day Saints and that as soon as he saw<br/>
his way clear he would endeavour to be baptized</p>

the continued and unceasing exertions which I had for months been making both<br/>
before and after my return to Nauvoo to follow with my family the body of the <br/>
Church to find a new home.</p>

<p>The next day was one of the most perplexing<br/>
of my life. I had on the ground three baggage waggons one family<br/>
carriage six yoke of oxen six cows 4 calves one yearling and a pair<br/>
of mules making in all 25 head. I started to go to the Black Jack<br/>
Grove to Camp. The whole care was upon myself. As soon as we had<br/>
started the cows and calves all ran various ways and while I was trying<br/>
to get them together the oxen broke the tongue out of my carriage  After<br/>
that was mended by leaving part of our stock we got started but we had<br/>
not gone far before my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] drove into a mud hole and the oxen<br/>
mired down. We put on 8 yoke of oxen to draw the waggon<br/>
out but we could not and broke four chains in the attempt. We<br/>
had to dig the waggon out at last and finally got camped at Black<br/>
Jack Grove very weary though we had made ^but^ four miles.</p>

and he delivered his errand. He was sent to raise a company of<br/>
men as pioneers to go immediately to the mountains without their families<br/>
to pick out a location and put in Spring and fall crops. The quorum of<br/>

<p>After we got our message I drove ahead as fast as<br/>
possible with my teams. We travelled 20 miles with our ox waggons<br/>

unsaddled our horses and made our bed in the grass on<br/>

from us encamped and were on their way to [[Mount Pisgah, Union County, Iowa|Mount Pisgah]]. We<br/>
immediately rode down to them and it was truly a happy meeting<br/>
and I rejoiced once more to st[r]ike hands with these noble men for<br/>
it was the first time we had met since I left [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] on my<br/>
mission to [[England|England]] in 1844 soon after the martyrdom of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and<br/>

myself and several of the Life guard returned until I met my family<br/>
and company and I had the privilege of introducing to the brethren<br/>
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and others. After spending a little time together they<br/>
continued their journey to Mount Pisgah to raise the five hundred<br/>
volunteers for the service of the United States. I tarried with<br/>
my family. I had ridden about 50 miles already that day and<br/>
was exceedingly sore and stiff and almost sick.</p>

to journey slowly through the day and on the next evening we<br/>
camped at the same place where I had camped with [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley]] in<br/>
the grass. An Indian Chief camped near us with some<br/>
squaws. The Indian said he was going to meet with Mormons<br/>
and smoke the pipe of peace.</p>

<p>Early next morning some 50 Indians<br/>
said to belong to the Sioux passed our camp for the east.<br/>
They said they were going to meet the Mormon Chief. We <br/>
supposed they ment President Young who had gone to Mount<br/>

rest. I was called upon to administer the ordinance of the Church</p>",

heart of the President and others of the nation to act for our interest and<br/>
the general good of Zion. The object of Presedent [[James Knox Polk|Polk]] was to enlist<br/>
500 of the Latter-day Saints and feed cloth[e] and pay them and<br/>
let them go direct to [[California|California]] via [[Santa Fe, Mexican Cession Territory|Santa Fe]] and take possession<br/>

across the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] Bottom to the Ferry. The brethren<br/>
who formed these companies had left their families teams and waggons<br/>
and cattle standing by the way side not expecting to meet them again<br/>
for one or two years. Yes here by the way side they left their<br/>
wives and children to the mercy of God and their brethren but they<br/>
went away with cheerful hearts beleving they were thus doing the will<br/>

hills and dales on the road that Emmit travelled to [[Big Pigeon Creek, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|big Pigeon]]. Here<br/>
we camped for the night with some of the Saints who had arrived<br/>
two hours before us. This was the first Mormon camp on the<br/>
Big Pigeon</p>

went to examine the Big Pigeon which I found well supplied with good<br/>

of Father [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]]. I went with him to the tent of the</p>",
42658.0,178,,""">Sunday the 13</time>th we held meeting. [[Orson Pratt|Orson<br/>
Pratt]] discoursed upon Sceentific principles. He was followed by<br/>
President [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] and then the Marshall of the city ^said^<br/>
that the City Council had passed certain acts among which were<br/>
that ""there shall be no <strike>firing</strike>^shooting^ of firearms after sundown<br/>
and no timber cut within 20 miles of the place without the<br/>
direction of the council and that dogs be taken care of and<br/>
no more shot without the direction of the Marshall</p>

<p><u>Discourse of President [[Brigham Young|Young]]</u></p>

<p>Afterwards President Young arose and said:</p>

<p>""I wish to say a few words upon principle<br/>
I desire the brethren and sisters to be taught in all things necessary<br/>
There is one thing I want you to realize and that is that God<br/>
angels and Saints—heaven and all of Gods creations are governed<br/>
by law. And I want the Camp of Israel to understand<br/>
that we must be. If Heaven was not controlled by law<br/>
what sort of a place would it be? I would not wish to be there<br/>
for where we rushed into heaven without law every man would<br/>
be in danger of loosing his rights and having them trampled<br/>
upon. But all celestial beings are governed by law and<br/>
order for the celestial law is a perfect order of things—a<br/>
perfect system of light law intelligence exaltation and glory<br/>
where every person's right's are sustained to the fullest extent</p>",
42658.0,179,,"<p>But we do not arrive at this at once. As an Apostle said we have precept<br/>
upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little until we<br/>
arrive at a fulness of knowledge and glory even that fulness which<br/>
reigns in the heavens</p>

<p>We must begin to be governed by law here<br/>
before we are prepared to receive the fulness that reigns in Heaven.<br/>
The whole law has not been given and you cannot abide the whole as<br/>
yet. If it had all been given we should all have been smashed<br/>
up and destroyed. A people must become acquainted thoroughly <br/>
with law before they can abide it; but the time has come when<br/>
we must have law and order in our midst</p>

<p>There has been some feelings of late in the<br/>
Camp because some unruly boys have been floged by the Marshall<br/>
for their wickedness; but if this Camp is not willing to let law<br/>
and order reign here and put a stop to such wickedness I wish<br/>
you to let me know it and I will go away from you for those<br/>
who wish to sustain crime and corruption let them return and<br/>
strike hands with the mob and carry out their principles and be<br/>
damned. But if you want to do right say so. This people<br/>
have been driven here for their desires to do righteousness and<br/>
this wickedness shall be put a stop to that has been manifest in<br/>
the camp by certain young people of late. Yes it will be<br/>
stopped if God comes out and smites it by judgement. The<br/>
Marshall did not whip them hard enough or they would not<br/>
have spit out their revenge but it would have been whipped<br/>
out of them. If I am drove to the necessity of whipping<br/>
a person in such a case they will not spit out revenge afterwards<br/>
for I will whip it out of them.</p>

<p>Shall we any longer sustain in our midst<br/>
men who will carry out the principles of [[John Cook Bennett|John C. Bennett]] and<br/>
other corrupt scoundrils? No: <strike>I will sware by the Eternal<br/>
God of Heaven that</strike> such conduct shall be stopped and shall<br/>
not be permitted in this Camp for if they continue it I will</p>",
42658.0,180,,"<p>tell the Marshall what the law is and they shall be taken care off<br/>
in a manner that they will not whine and [[Brigham Young|I]] will whip any man<br/>
who will sustain it. And I prophesy in the name of God<br/>
that such a man whether old or young shall be bowed down with<br/>
sorrow and mourning even more than this people have. Then<br/>
stop before you further go and not sport upon the brink of<br/>
sorrow and mourning. This people have the law of liberty<br/>
and the Gospel and the more the light and liberty and greater<br/>
the privileges the stricter the law. We are going into the<br/>
wilderness and shall we suffer such things? No: <strike>I sware by<br/>
the Eternal God</strike> such things shall not be while Brigham<br/>
lives.</p>

<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] gave a good shot<br/>
when he said that no man would run into his waggon and<br/>
sware that he would shoot the Marshall if he came after him<br/>
except he was guilty of crime. No man is a<strike>f</strike>fraid except<br/>
he is guilty. No man need be a<strike>f</strike>fraid who does right<br/>
I defy the world to say that I have taken away ^any^ man's right^s^ but<br/>
after we have been driven into the wilderness we are still followed<br/>
by men who sware that they will steal what they get in our<br/>
midst. <strike>I sware</strike> <strike>t</strike>They shall not have it <strike>in our midst</strike></p>

<p>Some young Elders who never preached<br/>
a sermon in their lives are a<strike>f</strike>faid that I shall have more <br/>
blessings than they or more wives or something or other but let<br/>
them go and preach the world over as I have in poverty and<br/>
distress with blood in my shoes and spent years and years<br/>
at it and left my wife and children who have also suffered much,<br/>
let them do as we have done and they will not be jealous of me<br/>
about blessings. If the Lord should give me a thousand<br/>
woman is it any man's business. No. Let such go and<br/>
spend as much time as I have and there will be many <br/>
clinging on to their skirts to be saved</p>

<p>The majority of the men of the Gentile</p>",
42658.0,181,,""">Sep. the 25</time></p>

<p>[[Squire Wells|Squire Wells]] arrived in Camp to day and also Brother<br/>
[[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]]. They were both direct from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. I sat about one</p>",
42658.0,182,,""">Sunday the 27</time> we spent hearing<br/>
read a Missourian paper giving an account of the battle between<br/>
the mob and the Mormons of Nauvoo; also of General [[Stephen W. Kearny|Karney's]]<br/>
army of the West among whom was the Mormon Battalion. There<br/>
was a prospect of the whole army suffering for want of food.</p>

<p>We appointed a meeting to be held at 2 o'clock<br/>
in our new city to hear a statement from [[Squire Wells|Squire Wells]] of the<br/>
affairs in Nauvoo. Before the meeting there was heard the<br/>
cry of fire on the prairie grass of the encampment. All ran<br/>
to put it out and it was soon extinguished</p>

<p>Meeting opened at 2 o'clock at the Council Block<br/>
by prayer from [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] who also made some remarks upon<br/>
the subject of the time and he was then followed by Squire Wells who<br/>
gave to the assembly</p>

<p>A Narrative of the Battle Between the Mormons of<br/>
Nauvoo and the Mob</p>

<p>He said: ""I will by request give a short account of<br/>
affairs in Nauvoo concerning their late difficulties. You have heard <br/>
that men were lynched there. We took 15 of the offenders who were sent<br/>
to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] for a trial and they were let out on bail. The mob then<br/>
issued writs against [[William Pickett|Pic<strike>b</strike>^k^et^t^]] [[Benjamin Clifford Jr.|Clifford]] and [[James E. Furness|Furnice]]. The two latter<br/>
went; Pic<strike>b</strike>^k^et^t^ would not. A mob was then raised as a <u>possee</u><br/>
to execute the writs they said. They stayed several weeks to<br/>
increase their numbers. They had at first about 300 and increased<br/>
to a thousand. The hundred men we had laid in ambush</p>",
42658.0,183,,"<p>for the mob. ^who^ <strike>They</strike> cannonaded through the day but did no harm. Next day<br/>
they tried the same thing again. We repelled them</p>

<p>On Saturday at 1 o'clock they advanced upon the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]]<br/>
with from a thousand to twelve hundred men. We met them in the name<br/>
of God and gained the victory. The action lasted one hour and twenty minutes<br/>
They fired 42 cannon balls and we 32 balls. Although the mob were<br/>
ten to our one they were defeated and retreated from the battlefield. We<br/>
had three killed and <strike>none</strike> ^2^ wounded. The mob would not acknowledge any<br/>
killed but we walked over the battlefield and found a plenty of mob blood<br/>
One man not a member of the Church said he saw them put 15 bodies in<br/>
one waggon and they were handled like dead ^hogs^ and other waggons were<br/>
loaded in the same way. One of the Saints lying in a cellar saw<br/>
8 wounded brought to the building each one telling where he was shot<br/>
They dug at their entrenchment after the battle. It was supposed<br/>
they buried their dead there.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. They did<br/>
not fire any but we threw some ball and burst one cannon</p>

<p>On Monday the mob sent us a cannon<br/>
ball to let us know they had some left and we sent it back again<br/>
During the fight the boys would watch the cannon ball strike and<br/>
run and get it and bring it to us and we would send it back<br/>
again.</p>

<p>On Tuesday a committee was sent to<br/>
us to make a treaty but it was rejected by both parties. A Brigade<br/>
was then called for but afterwards a treaty was made. We agreed<br/>
to surrender the city and leave in five days</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening the treaty was made<br/>
<strike>and the Saints</strike> and the Saints began to pack up their goods and the next day<br/>
all goods was removed. As the mob came in we left two blocks<br/>
in advance</p>

<p>We met many of the Saints on this side of the<br/>
river in distress and it drew tears ^even^ from the eyes of some of the mob<br/>
We saw campfires of the mob the same night we left on both</p>",
42658.0,184,,"<p>sides of the river.</p>

<p>There were scenes transpired in the seige enough to melt<br/>
the heart of a stone. The lynching of men when they are labouring for<br/>
a living and whipping them until they cannot stand alone as the mob<br/>
did was a damnable thing. They made them kneel on a spot where<br/>
they said some one was buried and placed them in a position so they<br/>
could be whipped easy. An old Revolutioneer was one of them<br/>
and he was so beaten by the mob that he has not been able to get<br/>
about all summer. I have an old grandfather—a Revolutioneer<br/>
I have thought I would not let him know anything about it but<br/>
keep it from him that his feelings might not be harrowed up as<br/>
he is about ready to sleep in his grave. But I will say no<br/>
more but give way for brother [[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]]</p>

<p>Brother Cutler said:</p>

<p>I can bear my testimony that<br/>
what brother [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] has said is strictly true. If I were to talk<br/>
till sundown the whole could not be told. I have been kept<br/>
in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] by the hand of God. Others wanted to have been<br/>
here and would have been had it not been necessary to stop to<br/>
save our brethren there who could not get away. I know the hand<br/>
of God has been manifest in the salvation of the people in Nauvoo<br/>
I thank God I had a hand in the battle. And the hand of God was<br/>
so visible in that battle that many who were weak and faltering have been<br/>
much strengthened by it and will gather with the Saints. I did not expect<br/>
that God would deliver their enem<strike>y</strike>ies into their hands but expected that<br/>
He would save them out of the hands of their enemies and this he had<br/>
done.</p>

<p>I was sensible we must leave Nauvoo. The time<br/>
had come for us to depart. God has called upon us to go and if we<br/>
will not he will let the mob loose upon us to drive us out but they<br/>
will not get any glory for it but will have to suffer for their wrongs<br/>
to the Saints.</p>

<p>I hope the day will come when we shall not</p>",
42658.0,185,,"<p>have to suffer from mobs but if we had sought to save our lives in this case<br/>
by fleeing many would have lost them for but few could have fled; but we<br/>
went out in the name of God and conquered. Through the blessing of God we have<br/>
done well. One brother put on a sheep bell and went near the camp to<br/>
spy out the enemy and they supposed it to be a sheep. The mob do not<br/>
acknowledge having any killed but they had a good deal of blood spilled there<br/>
they could not cover up which I saw. Captain Smith who was captain<br/>
of the guard at the time of the death of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] was shot in the neck but<br/>
not killed. Another commander of the mob was also shot. Bro [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]]<br/>
has done well in all places where he has been put in the midst of danger<br/>
as well as in safety. With regard to the citizens of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] there<br/>
were but few who stood by us in time of trouble. There are many<br/>
spirits in Nauvoo who are like bats ready to join any party that<br/>
conquer. If the beast conquer they will show their legs, if <br/>
the feathered tribe their wings.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] arose and said</p>

<p>I wish to make a few remarks<br/>
attached to those which have been made. I will inform the brethren<br/>
who have come up <strike>that we are</strike> that we are glad to see them. Brother<br/>
[[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]] has been with us before. Brother Wells has been in our society<br/>
for several years and I have had considerable acquaintance with<br/>
him and I am more than ever satisfied with his course. We have<br/>
prayed for our brethren continually. I am sensible that there is<br/>
a good deal of suffering there and here but let me say that the Lord God<br/>
who has fed us all the day long has His care still over us. When the<br/>
Saints are chastized enough it will cease. At least the hand of God<br/>
will be visible in their salvation. Some individuals may fall but<br/>
the body will be sustained. I have never believed the Lord would<br/>
suffer a general massacre of this people by a mob. If ten<br/>
thousand men were to come against us if no other way was open the<br/>
earth would open and swallow them up. Some say they can stay<br/>
in Nauvoo and can live there in perfect peace they ar so righteous</p>",
42658.0,186,,""">October the 15</time>th I took my<br/>
axe and went into the wood to cut some board-timber with two<br/>
of the brethren. While falling the third tree I steped back<br/>
from it several feet but when it fell it shot back of the<br/>
stump and bounded and struck me in the breast and knocked<br/>

of December</time> the High Council asked President [[Brigham Young|Young]] for some teaching and<br/>
he arose and said that he had no teaching to give at present but to cry<br/>
repentance to the people and he would begin with the High Council<br/>

Twelve would have to flee out of their midst and go to the Mountains</p>

<p>On the following Sunday I met with my<br/>
Ward the 14th for an organization according to the arrangement appointed<br/>
and I warned the people to repent before the Lord lest a scourge come<br/>
upon them. I was followed by Elders [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson<br/>
Pratt]] and brother Smith reproached the people for their treatment towards<br/>
me in not building me a<strike>n</strike> habitation for the Winter as I had been<br/>
sick.</p>

<p>We were informed that there was to be a meeting at<br/>
the Stand so we dismissed ours and repared to the meeting place where<br/>
we found a large congregation assembled and President Young addressing</p>",
42658.0,190,,"<p>[START HERE] them. The following are some of the words which fell from [[Brigham Young|his]] lips which<br/>
I noted while present<br/>
<u>President</u> <u>Young</u> <u>Cryin</u>g <u>Repentance</u> <u>to the</u> <u>Camp</u> of <u>Israel</u></p>

<p>He loudly called upon the Camp of Israel to repent and said:<br/>
""You must stop your swearing; you must stop your cheating; you <br/>
must stop your lying; you must stop your stealing; you must stop<br/>
your whoredoms; you must stop your backbitings—speaking evil of the <br/>
Twelve speaking evil of me—you must stop these things and put away<br/>
your wickedness or you will be damned; you will be destroyed; you will <br/>
be visited by pestilence and plague and by the sword and you will fall <br/>
to the ground and I warn you and foreworn you of these things if you <br/>
do not repent. Yes councillors High Priests and Elders here in <br/>
the camp of Israel will say I will be damned if I pay my tithing or<br/>
if i will do this or that.</p>

<p>If God was like man he would hurl you down <br/>
to hell and let you lie and welter there a thousand years and his mercy<br/>
only keeps you out</p>

<p>There are many here who are corrupt and<br/>
rotten at the core and I have no more fellowship for them than I have<br/>
for [[John Cook Bennett|John C. Bennett]]. If I fellowship these things it will drag me <br/>
down to hell with you and I will not do it. Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] being <br/>
a very merciful man bore with these things until it took his life <br/>
but I will not do it. Men get led away by degrees until the devil<br/>
gets possession of their tabernacles and they are led captive at the will of the<br/>
devil</p>

<p>And now I say that these who are calculating<br/>
to continue in wickedness and serve the devil had better go no further <br/>
with this camp. They had better go to [[Missouri|Missouri]] and spend the <br/>
rest of the time with the gentiles; for I can swear to them if they<br/>
go with us and continue their wickedness their heads shall be </p>",
42658.0,191,,"<p>severed from their tabernacles and the devils that are in them shall have no tabernacles<br/>
to dwell in</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is there are many places which<br/>
we pass through that have been the slaughter<strike>in</strike> ground of the ancient Nephites<br/>
and Lamanites and the spirits of devils are hovering around it and if<br/>
you are not on your guard they will enter you and lead you captive at their<br/>
will; for if you are not governed by the Spirit of God you will be by the<br/>
spirit of the devil. If you are governed by the Spirit of God while in<br/>
such places and they cannot enter <strike>you</strike> ^any of you^ they will try to enter your cattle<br/>
your beast for they want to enter some tabernacle as they did the swine in<br/>
ancient days</p>

<p>I had rather go to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] with the<br/>
Twelve alone and not to have another soul with us than to have those who<br/>
will not be subject to the Priesthood but practice wickedness and<br/>
serve the devil for if we continue with this company and they do not<br/>
repent the righteous will fall with the wicked</p>

<p>There are people in this camp who are stealing<br/>
hay and wood and I know who they are. Will [[Brigham Young|I]] fellowship them?<br/>
No I will not; and because we know who is guilty of wickedness they think<br/>
we are fellowshiping them and doing the same ourselves but it is not<br/>
so. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] suffered much from the same cause. Because he<br/>
knew of the rascality and wickedness his enemies and many of the<br/>
Saints thought he was guilty of it himself. The truth of the matter<br/>
is those who are leading the house of Israel while in the path of their<br/>
duty know the wickedness that is among the people. It cannot<br/>
be hid from them for they are in vision all the time</p>

<p>I will now look a little upon the other<br/>
side of the question. I will say however that if we have a<br/>
mind to be subject to the will of the Devil Death Hell and the<br/>
grave—we may be and bow down to it all the day long or<br/>
we may have perfect power and triumph over it</p>

<p>Who am I surrounded by? By men<br/>
who have entered into covenant with God who have received endowments in</p>",
42658.0,192,,"<p>the temple and are called to be saviours upon Mount Zion. To save what<br/>
Our Fathers and Israel clear back to Fallen [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] who are still lying in<br/>
their graves and waiting for the redemption of their bodies through your<br/>
instrumentality. Then will you curse sware lie steal commit<br/>
adultery and take the name of God in vain? Pretty saviours you<br/>
would be. O shame! God and angels would blush at such<br/>
conduct. Then repent and do the work appointed you. Many<br/>
are overtaken in fault who desire to repent and turn to God. Shall<br/>
we cast such away. Nay; but bear with them as God bears with<br/>
us. We cannot be sanctified all at once but have to<br/>
be tried and placed in all kinds of shapes and proven to the utmost<br/>
to see whether we will serve the Lord unto the end so that we may<br/>
be safe when we come into the Kingdom of God and not do as<br/>
Lucifer did the first time an opportunity is offered—rebel against<br/>
God and the Council of Heaven and be hurled down to hell in a<br/>
manner that you could not be redeemed at all</p>

<p>You must not sin murmur and complain<br/>
while in the midst of your trials because you have been mobbed<br/>
and tried even to the utmost. It is no excuse for you to commit<br/>
a wicked deed, take the name of God in vain or do any evil.<br/>
Now all of you forsake it. Repent and turn to God and you<br/>
shall be blessed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding [[Brigham Young|I]] have thus reproved<br/>
you I consider you the best people as a body on the earth and<br/>
if there were any better I would go to them and take you with<br/>
them who desired to go</p>

<p>In speaking of the redemption of our dead<br/>
I would say that there are millions who have died from the days<br/>
of Adam to Christ who <strike>we</strike>are waiting for their bodies to be raised<br/>
In comparason to the number but few arose at the resurrection<br/>
of Christ and they were some who had the Priesthood or fulness<br/>
of it sealed upon them.""</p>

<p><u>Summary of the Year</u></p>

<p>During the year 1846 my time had not been occupied in<br/>
preaching in the vineyard and building up churches. I felt the field<br/>
of my labours in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] at the office and in the British Mission<br/>
in general at the beginning of this year. Since then I had<br/>
crossed the Atlantic and travelled the bredth of the United States<br/>
gathered my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]] and [[Betsey Cossett Alvord|cousin]] to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with me<br/>
I arrived in Nauvoo on the 13th of April after a severely tiresome<br/>
long and dangerous passage in which the storms were so constant<br/>
and tremendous that I saw not a fire on ship board for the<br/>
space of 30 days. On my arrival in the city of the<br/>
Saints where I joined my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children who had only reached home<br/>
a few days before me I found that President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and the Twelve<br/>
had led out the camp of Israel into the wilderness and without a<br/>
moments rest after my return I gathered up my friends and a company<br/>
of Saints from the Gentiles and joined the camp of Israel in<br/>
their journeyings to the wilderness and passed through all the trials<br/>
privations labours and sufferings attendent on such a journey; and<br/>
in spite of my severe accident and broken bones late in the year I built<br/>
my own house helped the building of others cut down and drew my wood<br/>
and hay and generally assisted with the Twelve in establishing<br/>
[[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]]. Thus ended the year with the cares of the<br/>
Twelve daily increasing</p>",

arranged my journals and the following is</p>

<p>""The Word and Will of the Lord concerning the Camp<br/>
of Israel in their journeyings to the West""</p>

<p>""Let all the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of<br/>
Latter-Day Saints and those who journey with them be organized<br/>
into companies with a covenant and promise to keep all the commandments<br/>
and statutes of the Lord our God. Let the companies be organized with<br/>
captains of hundreds captains of fifties and captains of tens with a<br/>
president and his two counsellors at this head under the direction of<br/>
the Twelve Apostles: And this shall be our covenant that we will<br/>
walk in all the ordinances of the Lord.</p>

<p>Let each company provide themselves<br/>
with all the teams waggons provissions clothing and other necessaries<br/>
for the journey that they can. When the companies are organized<br/>
let them go to with their might to prepare for those who are to<br/>
tarry. Let each company with their captains and presidents<br/>
decide how many can go next spring; then choose out a sufficient<br/>
number of able bodied and expert men to take teams seeds and farming<br/>
utensils to go as pioneers to prepare for putting in Spring crops.<br/>
Let each company bear an equal proportion according to the dividend of<br/>
their property in taking the poor the widows the fatherless and the<br/>
families of those who have gone into the army that the crys of the<br/>
widow and the fatherless come not up into the ears of the Lord<br/>
against this people</p>

<p>Let each company prepare houses and fields<br/>
for raising grain for those who are to remain behind this season</p>",
42658.0,199,,"<p>and this is the will of the Lord concerning His people. <strike>Let every man</strike></p>

<p>Let every man use all his influence and property to<br/>
remove this people to the place where the Lord shall locate a stake of Zion:<br/>
and if ye do this with a pure heart in all faithfulness ye shall be blessed:<br/>
you shall be blessed in your flocks and in your lands and in your<br/>
fields and in your houses and in your families.</p>

<p>Let my servants [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]] and [[Erastus Snow|Erastus<br/>
Snow]] organize a company and let my servants [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and Wilford<br/>
Woodruff organize a company also let my servants [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]<br/>
and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] organize a company and appoint presidents<br/>
and captains of Hundreds and of Fifties and of Tens: and let my<br/>
servants that have been appointed go and teach this my will to<br/>
the Saints that they may be ready to go to a land of peace.<br/>
Go thy way and do as I have told you and fear not thine enemies<br/>
for they shall not have power to stop my work.</p>

<p>Zion shall be redeemed in my own due time<br/>
and if any man shall seek to build up himself and seeketh not my<br/>
counsel he shall have no power and his folly shall be made manifest<br/>
Seek ye and keep all your pledges one with another and covent not that<br/>
which is thy brothers. Keep yourselves from evil to take<br/>
not the name of thy God in vain; for I am the Lord your God<br/>
even the God of your fathers the God of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] and of [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]]<br/>
and of [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]]. I am he who led the children of Israel<br/>
out of the Land of [[Egypt|Egypt]] and my arm is stretched out in the<br/>
last days to save my people Israel</p>

<p>Cease to contend one with another<br/>
cease to speak evil one of another cease drunkeness and let your<br/>
words tend to edifying one another. If thou borrowest of thy neighbour<br/>
thou shalt restore that which thou hast borrowed and if thou canst<br/>
not repay then go straight way and tell thy neighbour lest he<br/>
condemn thee. If thou shalt find that which thy neighbour<br/>
has lost thou shalt make dilligent search till thou shalt deliver<br/>
it to him again</p>",
42658.0,200,,"<p>Thou shalt be diligent in preserving what thou hast that<br/>
thou mayest be a wise steward for it is the free gift of the Lord thy<br/>
God and thou art His steward.</p>

<p>If thou art merry praise the Lord with<br/>
singing with music with dancing and with a prayer of praise and<br/>
thanksgiving. If thou art sorrowful call on the Lord thy<br/>
God with supplication that your souls may be joyful. Fear<br/>
not thine enemies for they are in mine hands and I will<br/>
do my pleasure with them. My people must be tried<br/>
in all things that they may be prepared to receive the Glory<br/>
that I have for them even the glory of Zion and he that will<br/>
not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom</p>

<p>Let him that is ignorant learn wisdom<br/>
by humbling himself and calling upon the Lord his God that his<br/>
eyes may be opened that he may see and his ears opened that he<br/>
may hear; for my spirit is sent forth into the world to enlighten<br/>
the humble and contrite and to the condemnation of the ungodly</p>

<p>Thy brethren have rejected you and your<br/>
testimony even the nation that has driven you out and now<br/>
cometh the day of their calamity even the days of sorrow-like<br/>
a woman that is taken in trava<strike>l</strike>il and their sorrows shall be<br/>
great unless they speedily repent yea very speedily for they<br/>
killed the Prophets and they that were sent unto them and they<br/>
have shed inocent blood which cri<strike>s</strike>eth from the ground<br/>
against them. Therefore marvel not at those things<br/>
for ye are not yet pure:  Thou canst not yet bear<br/>
my glory but thou shalt behold it if ye are faithful in<br/>
keeping all my words that I have given you from the days<br/>
of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] to [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] from Abraham to [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] from Moses<br/>
to Jesus and the Apostles and from Jesus and his Apostles<br/>
to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph ^Smith^]] whom I did call upon by mine angels my<br/>

heavens to bring forth my work <u>which foundation he</u><br/>

because of his death; but it was needful that he should seal his testimony with<br/>
his blood that he might be honoured and the wicked might be condemned</p>

<p>Have I not delivered you from your enemies,<br/>
only in that I have left a witness of my name? Now therefore hearken<br/>
O ye people of my Church and ye Elders listen together. You have received<br/>
my kingdom; be diligent in keeping all my commandments lest<br/>
judgement come upon you and your faith fail you and your enemies<br/>
triumph over you.</p>

<p>So no more at present: Amen and Amen.""</p>",
42658.0,203,,""">15</time>th I met in Council with the Presidents and Counsellors<br/>
captains of hundreds Fifties and Tens to farther the organization of the camp of<br/>
Israel: I received an appointment to go to [[Keg Creek, Mills, Pottawattamie, Harrison and Shelby Counties, Iowa|Kegg Creek]] with brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]]<br/>
to organize the people there</p>

<p>Next day was a very interesting day to me. I<br/>
attended the family meeting of President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and he addressed<br/>
the meeting at great length during the day and evening. There were<br/>
present of the quorum of the Twelve Brigham Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] Wilford Woodruff [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa<br/>
Lyman]] and [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]].</p>

<p>After singing and prayer by President Young<br/>
he arose and addressed the meeting and remarked that he had invited<br/>
the Twelve to be present though they were not of his family yet he<br/>
wished them to act free and speak such things as the Lord shall give<br/>
them. He said, ""Let me state a principle by which you may<br/>
contemplate much. For the word of understanding many have<br/>
suffered jealousies to arise which afflicted their minds with<br/>
borrowed troubles and uneasiness fearing the Lord loved some<br/>
others more than themselves. This I have seen in the<br/>
Church ever since its rise. It was manifest in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. When<br/>
the first [[Edward Partridge|Bishop]] was ordained. This jealous feeling was manifest<br/>
Some wondered if the Lord would think enough of them to ordain them<br/>
a Bishop. Father [[Isaac Morley|Morley]] and others who were present can bear<br/>
record of this fact And when the Twelve were chosen the same<br/>
feeling existed and in fact I will not except all of them some of whom<br/>
manifested the same feelings when the Bishops were ordained. This<br/>
Spirit has been the overthrow of many in this Church and in fact<br/>
upon this principle thousands have fallen in all ages</p>

<p>The Lord gives to every man all the power<br/>
influence and authority he can wield in righteousness and all that his<br/>
goodness and faithfulness merits. Then why should jealousies<br/>
arise or what benefit can come by suffering such feelings to exist<br/>
Non at all; but he who cherishes such feelings commences trying</p>",
42658.0,204,,"<p>to pull down every one that is prospering or gaining influence as [[Cain (OT)|Cain]] did<br/>
instead of building up and nourishing every tree and thereby proving<br/>
himself worthy and showing to his brethren and to God that he loves<br/>
the cause and by his pasive spirit that he is not only willing<br/>
that offers should prosper and gain influence but that he actually<br/>
loves to see them prosper; for then he does all that he can through<br/>
himself if he helps to advance it through others although they receive <br/>
the honour of it and he still be aware of it. Such a man will never be<br/>
forgotten and to his honour and glory and exaltation there shall be<br/>
no end.</p>

<p>There is another principle that has<br/>
caused considerable uneasiness and trouble and that is the idea of<br/>
some men having more wives than one. Such tremendious<br/>
fears take hold of some that they hardly know how to live:<br/>
still they can't die. They began to whisper and talk around: ""I am<br/>
actually af<strike>f</strike>raid to go on a mission for fear some man will be sealed<br/>
to my wife""; and when they return some will be babling about<br/>
""You don't know but what you have got another man's wife"" and<br/>
they are a<strike>f</strike>fraid to speak to a young woman for fear that she belongs<br/>
to some one else or for fear some one else wants her. Others deny<br/>
the faith as they think (but they never had much) and say that it is<br/>
all of the devil. <strike>To</strike> Such foolishness ought not to be cherished among<br/>
a wise and prudent people.</p>

<p>Admiting the Lord created the same number<br/>
of woman as men at the beginning and commanded them to multiply<br/>
and replenish the earth and to fill up the measure of their creator in<br/>
righteousness the question is did they do it? Answer: No. They<br/>
soon disobeyed every commandment and plunged themselves into<br/>
wickedness and rendered themselves unworthy to raise up seed<br/>
unto the Lord and in fact used ever means in their power<br/>
to cut off life and hinder<strike>ing</strike> women answering the end for which<br/>
they were created. Nine tenths of them would rebel against<br/>
the very thing he was created to do. Hence you see the propriety of the</p>",
42658.0,205,,"<p>Lord calling upon men who hears the Pristhood to take to themselves wives from among<br/>
the daughters of men and raise up a righteous seed unto him that He might fill<br/>
up the measure of their creation and hasten the consummation of his purposes<br/>
in righteousness in this dispensation according to His word previously spoken<br/>
through His servants the Prophets.</p>

<p>Those who suffer fears and jealousies to arise<br/>
in their bosoms either back right out or get to be mighty righteous and for fear<br/>
they are sleeping with other men's wives they kick up a dust or broil at home<br/>
and perhaps abuse their own companion through jealousy then go off to<br/>
some woman that does not understand what is right or wrong and tell her<br/>
that she cannot be saved without a man and he has almighty power<br/>
and can exalt and save her and likely tell that there is no harm for them<br/>
to sleep together before they are sealed and then go to some dough-head<br/>
of an Elder and get him to say the ceremony and all done without the<br/>
knowledge of the Authority of this Church. This is not right<br/>
and will not be suffered. The God [[Brigham Young|I]] serve will reward every man<br/>
openly without his being under the necessity of going secretly and<br/>
privately proclaiming himself in the creativity of ignorant inocent<br/>
females.</p>

<p>Such jealousies do exist and were I to say<br/>
to the Elders you now have the liberty to build up your kingdoms one<br/>
half of them would lie swear steal and fight like the very devil to get<br/>
men and women sealed to them. They would even try to pass<br/>
right by me and go to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] thinking to get between him and<br/>
the Twelve. Some have already tried to use an<strike>d</strike> influence<br/>
against me but such jealousies and selfishness shall be stoped and<br/>
if the brethren do not stop it I will blow it to the four winds<br/>
by making them all come and be sealed to me and I to my [[John Hayden Young|father]]<br/>
and he and all this Church to Joseph</p>

<p>When I go astray and give wrong counsel<br/>
and lead this people astray then is time enough to pull me<br/>
down and then God will remove me as He has done all others<br/>
who have turned from the faith.</p>",
42658.0,206,,"<p>But to return. [[Brigham Young|I]] have gathered a number of families<br/>
around me by the law of adoption and seal of the covenant according to the<br/>
order of the Priesthood and others have done likewise it being the<br/>
means of salvation left to bring us back to God. But had the keys<br/>
of the Priesthood been retained and handed down from father to<br/>
son throughout all generations up to the present time then there<br/>
would have been no necessity of the law of adoption for<br/>
we would have all been included in the covenant without<br/>
it and have been legal heirs instead of being heirs according<br/>
to promise.</p>

<p>The Priesthood is eternal; without<br/>
begining of days or end of life as the Apostle has expressed<br/>
it; but man through apostacy which is entire disobedience<br/>
has lost or suffered the keys and privileges of the Priesthood<br/>
to be taken away from them and left to wander in darkness<br/>
and practise all manner of wickedness until thousands<br/>
became the vessels of wrath and were doomed to destruction<br/>
for as long as men are without the Priesthood They continue<br/>
to be without God and never retrace their steps until it is<br/>
done by the Priesthood. The idea of the Saint being<br/>
led by false Prophets is just a notion according to the light<br/>
in which they view them. All the false Prophets we<br/>
have are the men who have turned away from the truth.</p>

<p>The man is the head and god of the<br/>
woman but let him act like God in virtuous principles and<br/>
Godlike conversation walk and department. Such men will continue<br/>
to gain influence and power and advance in glory to all eternity<br/>
But should they use their power in wickedness as a tyrant they will soon<br/>
be called to render an account of their stewardship. If not<br/>
found worthy they will be hurled down to perdition and their<br/>
family and kingdom be given to another that is worthy. Some<br/>
say that a woman cannot be saved without a man: neither can <br/>
a man without a woman.</p>",
42658.0,207,,"<p>Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said he had taught the Twelve all he knew<br/>
concerning the order of the kingdom but the difficulty was they could not<br/>
remember it as he told them but when it was necessary they would<br/>
not be at a loss for understanding. And [[Brigham Young|I]] bear record of the truth<br/>
of his word before God this day that I always had an understanding and<br/>
everything was brought <strike>them</strike> to my mind just as he taught <strike>them</strike> ^it^ to<br/>
us. All the ordinances of the Temple and building of the altar &amp;c<br/>
came to me just right when they were to be attended to and could we<br/>
now know brother [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]]s feelings you would say<br/>
that they could read a man through as soon as they cast their eyes upon<br/>
him.</p>

<p>The Apostle [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] while speaking of the Fathers<br/>
and the ancients said that they without us could not be made perfect.<br/>
There was a lack in his story and still will be to all eternity until<br/>
the chain of that Priesthood is restored and every spirit take a tabernacle<br/>
that was forordained according to the dispensation of the will of God.</p>

<p>I am entitled to the keys of the Priesthood<br/>
according to linage and blood. So is brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
and many others—and have taken ^the various^ <strike>kingly power and grades</strike> <br/>
of the Priesthood. This we would have taught in the Temple<br/>
had time permitted. Joseph Smith was entitled to the keys<br/>
of the Priesthood according to blood. Still he was the fourth son.<br/>
But when we get another Temple built then we will teach you<br/>
concerning these things. Suffice it to say that I will extend<br/>
the chain of the Priesthood back through the Apostlolic Dispensation<br/>
to Father [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] just as soon as I can get a Temple built.</p>

<p>Jesus could have restored the order of <br/>
the Priesthood in his day and brought in the Millenium if the<br/>
people would have hearkened to his instructions but they rebelled and<br/>
would not and it was for this cause that Jesus told them<br/>
that all the blood which had been shed from righteous<br/>
[[Abel (OT)|Abel]] down to [[Zechariah (OT)|Zachariel]] the Prophet should be required<br/>
at their hands. [##Matthew 23:34-35##]</p>",
42658.0,208,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] have a request to make of my family and that<br/>
is that they (especially old people omit calling me their father.<br/>
Call me Brother Brigham. I shall fell better when yo[u] do<br/>
for I do not consider that I am worthy of that appelation. Father<br/>
in the Priesthood implies the great Head. The term would be<br/>
proper to Father [[Adam (OT)|Adam]]. Jesus had reference to the same<br/>
thing when he told his disciples not to call any man father<br/>
on earth for their Father was in heaven.</p>

<p>The seal of the covenant that I<br/>
have been speaking of to day was what the Apostle saw<br/>
previous to the destruction of the wicked when the angel<br/>
was commanded not to pour out the viall of wrath upon the<br/>
wicked until the Saints were sealed in their forehead<strike>s</strike><br/>
and when this was done they all became Father Adam's<br/>
family.</p>

<p>Those that ^belong to^ <strike>are adopted into</strike> my family<br/>
and take me for their Councillor if I continue faithful I<br/>
will preside over them throughout all eternity. I will<br/>
stand at their head and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] will stand at the head<br/>
of this Church and will be the President &amp; Prophet <strike>and God</strike><br/>
to the people in this dispensation.</p>

<p>When we locate I will settle<br/>
my family down in the order and teach them their duty.<br/>
They will then have to provide temporal blessings for<br/>
me instead of my boarding from 40 to 50 persons as<br/>
I now do. I will administer in spiritual blessings<br/>
to them. I expect to live in the House of the<br/>
Lord and receive and administer ordinances to my brethren<br/>
and for the dead all the year round.""</p>

<p>President [[Heber Chase Kimball|H.C. Kimball]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson<br/>
Pratt]] then address briefly President Young's family<br/>
meeting and then there was an intermission until</p>",
42658.0,209,,"<p>after supper.</p>

<p>The table was will furnished and supplied.<br/>
Forty persons could be seated at the table at a time. The men<br/>
were seated to the right with their companions opposite to them<br/>
commencing with the Twelve President [[Brigham Young|Young]] at their head; then in order<br/>
the ^rest^ <strike>adopted children begining with the 1st that was adopted.</strike> The<br/>
band and choir kept their seats and discoursed their sweet strain of<br/>
music while the guest were partaking of the rich festival.</p>

<p>While at table brother [[Thomas Woolsey|Thomas Wolsley]]<br/>
and [[John Harvey Tippets|John H Tippetts]] came in. They were direct from the<br/>
Mormon Battalion 280 miles south of [[Santa Fe, Mexican Cession Territory|Santa Fe]] on the river<br/>
[[Rio Grande River, United States|Rio Grande]] on the 10th of Nov. 1846. they had piloted fifty six<br/>
sick men to [[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Pueblo]] where Cap [[John Brown|Brown]]'s estableshment was<br/>
stationed. From thence they came in on packmules were<br/>
50 days on the way and were taken prisoners twice by the<br/>
Indians and once was sentenced to death by the Pawnees. For<br/>
thirty days they were without bread and five days were without<br/>
much of anything to eat. These brethren brought a package<br/>
of 137 letters and a good account from Fort Pueblo <strike>but rather<br/>
unfavorable from the Battalion who were described as resembling<br/>
mountineers in their persons.</strike></p>

<p>The arrived of these brethren in the<br/>
camp produced no small stir. Men and women came from<br/>
all directions to enquire after their friends in the army.</p>

<p>After the men were refreshed we went<br/>
into council with them and they rehearsed the salvation of the Battalion.<br/>
The brethren composing it had been on half rations for three weeks<br/>
when they left them and no prespects of more than half rations<br/>
should they attempt to cross the mountains that Winter. Report<br/>
however had reached Santa Fe when they arrived that the<br/>
Battalion had taken the [[El Paso del Norte, Chihuahua, Mexico|Alpasio]] a strong hold between the<br/>
Rio Grande and the Mountains without the firing of a gun<br/>
President Young said that if they had hearkened to his counsel</p>",
42658.0,210,,"<p>not a man of them would have fallen but would all have returned to their<br/>
friends in perfect safety.</p>

<p>We returned to the [[Council House, Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Council House]] at 7 o'clock.<br/>
The Saints were rejoicing in what they had heard that day and after Elder<br/>
[[Isaac Morley|Isaac Morley]] had expressed himself upon the occassion President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
arose and continued his remarks upon the Law of adoption.</p>

<p>""The Lord introduced the law of adoption for the<br/>
benefit of the children of men as a schoolmaster to bring them back<br/>
into the covenant of the Priesthood. This principle I am<br/>
aware is not clearly understood by many ^of the^ Elders in this church<br/>
at the present time as it will hereafter be: and I confess that<br/>
I have only a smattering of those things; but when it is<br/>
necessary I will attain to more knowledge upon the subject<br/>
and consequently shall be enabled to teach and practice more.<br/>
In the mean time glorify God the bountiful Giver.</p>

<p>I have heard Elders say they were<br/>
not dependant upon any man. It was saying more than<br/>
I can say for I consider that we are all dependant one<br/>
upon another for our exaltation and that our interest is<br/>
inseperably connected. For example: What can my family<br/>
do without me. Supposing they were to all turn away<br/>
from me. I hold the keys over them through which they are to receive<br/>
their exaltation. Would they not be like sheep without a shepherd?<br/>
and be devoured by the wolves? They certainly would. Then<br/>
let us change the position and say that I would cut off all my<br/>
family then what glory would I have with no body to rule over<br/>
but my own dear little self. To tell you my feelings<br/>
I would rather be annihilated than to be in that situation.</p>

<p>This is another proof of the Apostle's<br/>
saying when he declared that they without us could not be made<br/>
perfect. Neither can you without me nor I without<br/>
you that is to say if we are faithful for without faithfullness</p>",
42658.0,211,,"<p>there is no perfection on any consideration.</p>

<p>This rule applies to the whole human family.<br/>
This is the torment and misery of the disobedient spirits that they cannot<br/>
be made perfect unless some scheme should hereafter be introduced<br/>
for their redemption.</p>

<p>They are now without tabernacles to dwell in<br/>
only such as they have taken possession of unlawfully and usurped<br/>
power over. It is a part of their agency that was allowed them which<br/>
they use to the consummation of their unhappy and wretched estate it<br/>
being the reward and fruits of their doings having been given over to<br/>
all manner of wickedness and permitted to afflict the handy work of the<br/>
Lord until they fill up the cup of their iniquity. Then the Lord<br/>
will say unto them, ""Thou wicked and disobedient spirit thou<br/>
shalt not have power any longer to afflict my people or destroy the works<br/>
of my hands: you have forfeited your agency and wrought your fulness;<br/>
depart hence to the pit that I have prepared for thee.</p>

<p>This is their torment that their power<br/>
and agency is taken from them and they are left to regret that it<br/>
was through their own disobedience they cut the thread of their own<br/>
salvation. This reflection only serves to torture and<br/>
increase their torment.</p>

<p>And this would be the situation of my<br/>
family were they to cut themselves off from me. [[Brigham Young|I]] use my family<br/>
as an example not that I have the least fears, of their ever doing<br/>
so, for I have none.</p>

<p>I feel happy this night because we are<br/>
of one mind. Still should I believe that we were perfect and<br/>
could not advance any farther I should not be happy. But to<br/>
the honour power and glory of the faithful there is no end.</p>

<p>For your satisfaction I will show you<br/>
a rule by which you may comprehend the exaltation of the<br/>
faithful. I will use myself as a figure and say that I am<br/>
ruling over ten sons or subjects and soon each of them would have</p>",
42658.0,212,,"<p>ten more sealed to them and they would be rulers over them and that<br/>
would make me ruler over ten Presidents or kings whereas [[Brigham Young|I]] was ruler<br/>
over ten subjects only: or in other words I ruled over one kingdom<br/>
but now I should rule over ten. Then let each get ten more<br/>
then I should be ruler over one hundred kingdoms and so on continued<br/>
to all eternity. The more honour and glory that I could<br/>
bestow upon my sons the more it would add to my exaltation<br/>
but to clip the thread of your exaltation then where would be<br/>
your glory? It would be like the fallen angels or devils<br/>
that kept not their first estate but were reserved in<br/>
everlasting chains of darkness unto the judgement of the<br/>
great day. Others fell from heaven were thrust down<br/>
to hell. But if you wish to advance hold up the<br/>
hands of your file leader. Should you have ten legions<br/>
of trains following on after you, you should say to<br/>
your file leader push ahead for I am coming with<br/>
my train lifting him up at the same time instead of<br/>
trying to pass by him. This would stimulate <br/>
him and he would say come on my boys I will travel<br/>
as fast as you can and on we would go in one solid<br/>
train to all eternity.</p>

<p>Before I close I will answer one<br/>
question that has been asked me repeatedly. Should I have<br/>
a father dead who has never heard this gosepl would<br/>
it be required of me to redeem him and have him adopted<br/>
into some man's family and I be adopted unto my father<br/>
I answer no.</p>

<p>If we have to attend to the ordinances<br/>
of redemption for our dead relatives we then become their<br/>
saviors and were we to wait to redeem our dead relatives<br/>
before we could link the chain of the Priesthood we would never<br/>
accomplish it.""</p>

Rocky Mountains to find at new home.</p>

<p>It was a fine morning; the sun<br/>
shone brightly the Heavens smiled upon us and our hearts<br/>
were made glad. There was not much business done.<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] addressed the Assembly with good sound<br/>

<p>The day after the General Conference I took<br/>
leave of my family and friends and started with my company<br/>
of Pioneer waggons 8 in number and left Winter Quarters for<br/>
our journey to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] to select a location for the<br/>
Church and prepare for the body of the Saints to follow.</p>

<p>When we were on the top of the<br/>
ridge west of the city I took a view of the city and looked<br/>
at my wife and children though my glass. I then led<br/>
the company to the old camp ground from thence on the<br/>
Punkaw road about 7 miles and camped for the night, ten<br/>
miles from Winter Quarters.</p>

<p>We had excellent stables for our<br/>
horses in a valley near a small stream of water. We<br/>
had not been camped long before Brother [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] and his<br/>
company arrived and close upon them President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and<br/>
his Company so we all camped together about 25 waggons<br/>
of us and it was a very windy night.</p>

<p>In the morning we arose and took<br/>
breakfast. A squirel was killed and it being the first<br/>
game killed by the Pioneer Companies I moved that the<br/>
first fruits of the game be offered to the Priest: so it was<br/>
presented to President Young for his breakfast.</p>

<p>President Young Father [[Isaac Morley|Morley]] and others<br/>
went to the old camping ground to pick them out a place for<br/>
a farm and I with several others spent the day in hunting<br/>
<strike>could</strike> but caught nothing but weary limbs and wet feet. We saw<br/>
however deer geese ducks &amp;c.</p>",
42658.0,219,,"<p><u>Commence here</u></p>

<p>When I returned to camp in the evening from our<br/>
unsuccessful hunting expedition I learned that [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] had arrived<br/>
at [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] from his mission to [[England|England]], and that President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and others had gone back to the city to see him.</p>

<p>In the morning I mounted my horse<br/>
and started for Winter Quarters to see brother Parley the Twelve my<br/>
family and others. Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] was at our camp the day before<br/>
while I was out hunting and left a letter for me in answer to the<br/>
one I had written to her.</p>

<p>Before I got to the city I met the<br/>
Twelve. I was within half a mile of home yet I turned about<br/>
with them returned to the camp of pioneers harnessed our<br/>
horses and drove until dark 10 miles towards the [[Elkhorn River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Horn]] leaving<br/>
brothers Young and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] several miles behind.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we started<br/>
drove to the Horn and crossed it with all ^our^ teams ^on a raft^ before sunset.</p>

<p>The following was Sunday. We crossed<br/>
over 20 waggons in the morning and then Presidents Young<br/>
and Kimball arrived with their companions and we<br/>
continued to ferry them until they were all over. We moved<br/>
down our encampment 2 miles and spent the night.</p>

<p>Next day the encampment moved up the <br/>
[[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]] 14 miles; but the quorum of the Twelve and others recrossed<br/>
the Horn and returned to Winter Quarters. Four of us followed<br/>
an Indian trail and cut off 15 miles. It was 35 miles by the<br/>
waggon route but only 20 the way we went.</p>

<p>I was very busy the next day painting<br/>
one of my waggons to take away and sell. I got another horse<br/>
to take away with me and was in council with the quorum<br/>
of the Twelve until midnight. Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] was with<br/>
us. He arrived in the city in the evening on this return<br/>
from England. We were all glad to meet him once more.<br/>
He brought for our use on this Pioneer journey two Sextants</p>",
42658.0,220,,"<p>two baromaters two artificial horizons one circle of reflection<br/>
and one telescope, all of which were exhibited to us in the<br/>
evening and boxed up so that we could take them along.</p>

<p>Next day I called together my family<br/>
and blessed my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children and left them in the<br/>
hands of the Lord. I bade farewell to Father [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Woodruff]]<br/>
and family and all around me and took my leave<br/>
of [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] and in company with Elders [[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]]<br/>
[[Amasa Mason Lyman|A. Lyman]] [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]] [[Erastus Snow|E. Snow]] and others we again<br/>
took the Indian trail and rode through the Prairie to<br/>
[[Elkhorn River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Elk Horn]] and went over on a raft and camped two miles<br/>
below the Ferry. We had an excellent supper of<br/>
fried catfish pork beans short-cake honeycomb coffee<br/>
milk &amp;c. We all eat very hearty. had prayers &amp; retired to bed.</p>

<p>Professor O Pratt the next morning<br/>
took an observation for the correct time. Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Newel Kimball Whitney|Whitney]] and others came and crossed the ferry<br/>
and we all moved up to the general camp on the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte<br/>
River]] 9 miles in advance of us. We found the camp<br/>
very busy in blacksmith work preparing to ^continue^ <strike>contue</strike> our<br/>
journey.</p>

<p>Brother [[Jesse Carter Little|Jesse C. Little]] arrived from<br/>
the Eastern States in our midst. Finding us not at<br/>
Winter Quarters he followed and overtook us this evening. He<br/>
gave us news of the Eastern Churches and brought a remembrance<br/>
to the quorum of the Twelve from our friend Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]]<br/>
in a variety of presents to us. The Col. had sent me a<br/>
patent life preserver and a stop-compass.</p>

<p>Brothers Little [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|Rockwell]] and [[Jack Reading|Reading]]<br/>
returned to Winter Quarters next morning and the camp continued<br/>
4 miles up the Platte.</p>

<p>Before we left this morning the camp<br/>
came together and was organised <strike>the</strike> for journeying <strike>as a military</strike></p>",

be shut on a piece of buckskin with caps ready to slip on at<br/>
the instant in case of attack, for flint locks with cotton or tow<br/>
in the pan and powder flask always handy to prime quickly<br/>
and for every man to walk by the side of his waggon and not<br/>
to leave it except sent away by order. The object of all this<br/>
caution was to prevent accident for strict discipline was necessary<br/>
while travelling through a hostile Indian country.</p>",
42658.0,222,,""">Sunday the 18</time> President [[Brigham Young|Young]] called<br/>
the captains together and gave them instructions concerning our travel.<br/>
We were to start in the morning two abreast all who were not driving<br/>
teams were to carry their guns and walk by the side of the waggons<br/>
and no man to go hunting to get out of sight of the camp. In<br/>
the ^evening^ <strike>morning</strike> the bugle was to be blown at ^5 o'clock^ <strike>half past 8 o'clock</strike> and<br/>

and start at the call of the bugle at 7 o'clock and at night<br/>
the bugle was to be blown at half past eight when all w<strike>as</strike>ere to<br/>
go to prayers in their several waggons and retire to bed by<br/>
9 o'clock. Each Saturday night we were to pitch<br/>
our tents or camp in our waggons and rest f<strike>or</strike>rom our journey<br/>
on the Sabbath. This was the order of The Camp.</p>

<p>It was quite cold on Monday morning.<br/>
The bugle blew at five o'clock for prayers and at seven for starting.<br/>
We travelled according to general orders and bore a no[r]therly direction<br/>
until about noon when we reached the north bend of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]]<br/>
10 1/2 miles north of the ford. Professor [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] took an<br/>
observation and found it to be in Lat. 41. 27. 5.: The crossing<br/>
place of the [[Elkhorn River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Horn]] was in Lat. 41. 16. 24., making the North<br/>
Bend of the Platt 10 1/2 miles north of the ford. We formed<br/>
a circle at noon and baited.</p>

<p>While nooning Elder [[Jesse Carter Little|Little]] [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|P. Rockwell]]<br/>
and two others arrived and brought the meal. I received<br/>
two letters one from my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and one from [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]]<br/>
of [[Massachusetts|Mass]] who informed me that [[Milton Holmes|Milton Homes]] and his [[Nathaniel Holmes|father]]<br/>
and [[Abigail Poor Holmes|mother]] had turned strangites and been cut off the church.</p>

<p>Brother Little brought with him</p>",
42658.0,223,,"<p>many things that Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|T Kane]] had sent as presents to the Twelve and others. I<br/>
recieved a stop-box marriners compass small enough to carry in the pocket.<br/>
It was a splendid present.</p>

<p>We camped at night near a grove of timber on<br/>
the bank of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]] where we formed a circle on the edge of the bank.<br/>
The river on one side was our defence and the forewheel of each waggon was<br/>
drove up to the hinder wheel of the one before it and all the horses<br/>
and cattle taken inside of the corrall: so that we were secure against<br/>
the Indians.</p>

<p>There was a hard wind during the night and<br/>
the morning was fair but a strong south ^west^ wind which covered our waggons<br/>
with sand dust.</p>

<p>The grass was now about 4 inches high s[c]attering<br/>
and there was not half feed for our animals so all along thus far we<br/>
had to cut down cottonwood trees &amp;c to feed them and the horses<br/>
would knaw off the bark from brouse limbs as readily<br/>
as they would eat corn of which we gave to each horse 2 quarts<br/>
per day.</p>

<p>We started on our journey 2 1/2 miles and<br/>
came to another grove of small and large cottonwood covering<br/>
about 40 acres. It was about 5 miles to the tableland<br/>
which was now rising into a bluff. Here the road runs 20<br/>
degrees south of the west Bending to S. by W. one mile in<br/>
which distance we passed three Islands in the Platte covered<br/>
with timber the largest of which was about ten acres and<br/>
there continues a chain of Islands for miles along the river<br/>
and some timber on the south side of the Platte.</p>

<p>Three miles from our last encampment<br/>
we came to [[Shell Creek, Nebraska Territory|Shell Creek]] and one and half miles from Shell<br/>
Creek is a Prairie Dog village covering about 6 acres of ground.<br/>
This Creek was timbered only by a few scattering willows. <strike>and<br/>
the river was about parallel</strike></p>

<p>After crossing Shell Creek bridge the</p>",
42658.0,224,,"<p>road runs about S.W. by W. 60 degrees west of South for about 15 miles.<br/>
<u>The Platt is skirted <strike>by</strike>with timber</u></p>

<p>Professor [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] and myself went forward<br/>
of the company to take observations. After travelling 13 miles we<br/>
stoped baited horses and took observations. The company approached us<br/>
and we continued on 5 miles and the whole encampment came up and<br/>
we camped for the night in a cirlce and cut down cottonwood trees to<br/>
feed our horses.</p>

<p>The following day was <strike>A</strike> cloudy day <strike>was the next one</strike> with a <br/>
light sprinkling of rain and wind in the east and our course westward.<br/>
The teams started at 7 o'clock and the horse teams between 8 and 9.<br/>
An Indian appeared on a mound mounted on a poney about 5 miles<br/>
from us. He went out of sight and again appeared. He then<br/>
approached the camp full speed was met by the brethren and<br/>
shook hands and was followed by seven others. They went through<br/>
the encampment and then returned with us.</p>

<p>We travelled til half past 12 o'clock when<br/>
when we came in sight of 70 Indian horses and mules and soon in<br/>
sight of a large Pawnee village on the North side of [[Loup Fork, Nebraska Territory|Loop Fork]] and<br/>
also one on the south side of it. We drove on by the villages<br/>
and they soon began to sally out to come to us and we camped<br/>
in the form of a half moon the bank of the river forming<br/>
a parallel line in front.</p>

<p>The Indians to the number of about<br/>
200 0n the South side of the river came down to the shore. Some<br/>
waded over and about 75 came into camp including the grand chief<br/>
of the nation with many war chiefs. We met them before<br/>
we left the ground and made them presents of 4 <strike>1</strike> lbs of tobacco<br/>
15 lbs of lead powder fishhooks beads flour salt &amp;c but still<br/>
they were not satisfied. Considering our numbers they thought<br/>
they ought to have had more.</p>

<p>When we left the ground the<br/>
Indians oppeared very disatisfied but we harnessed up our teams</p>",
42658.0,225,,"<p>and drove on to [[Looking Glass Creek, Nebraska Territory|Lookingglass Creek]] and camped at its mouth for the night upon<br/>
the bank of the [[Loup Fork, Nebraska Territory|Loop Fork]].</p>

<p>After our horses were turned out we were called<br/>
together and in consequence of the disatisfaction of the Indians  a guard of 100<br/>
men was called for. The quorum of the Twelve with nearly the whole<br/>
camp volunteered to stand guard one half of them the forepart of the<br/>
night and the other the latter part. We also had a picket guard of<br/>
five men with their mules at each watch.</p>

<p>I was one of the picket guard. We had<br/>
a hard wind and rain in the afternoon which continued a portion of<br/>
the time that I was on guard. I rolled myself up in my buffalo<br/>
robe and let the wind and rain beat on to me. We were released<br/>
at about 1 o'clock and went to rest; but no Indians appeared <br/>
during the night.</p>

<p>Looking Glass Creek was crossed 15 minutes<br/>
before 9 on the morrow and a westerly course continued and [[Beaver Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Beaver<br/>
Creek]] reached at noon. There was a good many otter on the <br/>
Lookingglass and Beaver about a mile above the mouth of Beaver<br/>
Creek.</p>

<p>Professor [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] took the meridian observation<br/>
of the sun by the sextant for the Lat. which was found to be<br/>
41° 25' 15"". <strike>We also found the magnetic needle to<br/>
vary about 12 degrees east </strike> and also made other observations<br/>
for the time &amp;c.</p>

<p>We crossed ^Beaver^ <strike>Beverer</strike> Creek at half past two o'clock<br/>
travelled seven miles and came to the [[Pawnee Missionary Station, Nebraska Territory|Pawnee Missionary Station]]<br/>
and camped for the night. The Bluff was skirted with some<br/>
oaks on the north side of the road in the hills. We kept out a guard<br/>
through the night as we were in danger of the Sioux on the one<br/>
side and the Pawnees on the other.</p>

<p>While watering the horses at the creek at<br/>
the station this evening brother [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]'s horse mired<br/>
pitched forward and jumped on to him treading upon his feet and</p>",

<p>The next day was one of adventures to the Pioneer<br/>
company. In the morning 12 of us started on horse back to<br/>
search out a ford across the dangerous and troublesome Loop Fork<br/>
up the Platte River.</p>

<p>We went down the River some distance<br/>
and several men waded across and found the water so deep and <br/>
so much quicksand that we came to the conclusion to drive up<br/>
to the old Pawnee Village. So we returned to the camp and<br/>
harnessed up our horses.</p>

<p>My gray horse named Titus <strike>had the</strike> was sick yet I started out with him and the camp drove<br/>
up with some little difficulty to the old Indian village or a little<br/>
below it and men commenced searching out a ford and found the<br/>
whole bed of the river one body of quicksand into which if a horse<br/>
or waggon stoped it would begin to sink down.</p>

<p>We had two channels of water to cross<br/>
with a sand bar in the middle. The deepest water was from 3<br/>
to 4 feet deep and very rapid and about 300 yards across. At<br/>
some places the quicksand sank both man and beast instantly and<br/>
the more they struggled to get out the more they would sink. Of<br/>
course we avoided such places as much as possible.</p>

<p>As I led the van with my ten being<br/>
the 1st ten it fell to my lot to make the first trial. Professor<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] having a strong pair of horses went forward and I followed<br/>
him. I had two yoke of cattle and my horses on my<br/>
carriage with about ten hundred on it.</p>

<p>As soon as I started I immediately</p>",
42658.0,227,,"<p>saw that the cattle did but little good being slow and in the way. We would stop<br/>
and begin to sink. I jumped out of my carriage into the water up to my<br/>
waist and about ten men came to my assistance with a drag rope and<br/>
hitched it to the oxen and assisted me in getting across the first stream<br/>
though with great difficulty.</p>

<p>We stoped on a sand bar out of the water<br/>
but my horses and waggon began to sink. By treading the ground a little<br/>
it would become a perfect quagmire; yet though we were sinking in it<br/>
the men had to leave the waggon where it was and go to the assistance<br/>
of [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] who in trying to cross the second stream had sunk into<br/>
a bed of quicksand and all the men had to go to his relief to get his horses<br/>
and waggon out. The horses were unhitched from the wagon and<br/>
the load taken out and carried to shore by hand and the waggon drawn<br/>
out by the help of men.</p>

<p>I took off a part of my load in fact most<br/>
of it in a boat and went through the second stream nearly empty and<br/>
got out two other waggons done in the same way but it was so<br/>
terrific an<strike>d</strike> undertaking that the rest of the camp would not follow in <br/>
our track.</p>

<p>So here we found ourselves on the opposite<br/>
side of the River 6 men of us to spend the night together with our horses<br/>
and waggons to guard against the whole Pawnee band then camped<br/>
below us on the same side of the river; and it was supposed they<br/>
numbered 600 warriors. We divided our company making three<br/>
on guard at a time.</p>

<p>Brother [[John Pack|Pack]] Orson Pratt and myself went.<br/>
on guard the forepart of the night. Although I had been in the<br/>
water the whole of the afternoon I stood guard in my wet clothing<br/>
one half of the night and slept in them the other half.</p>

<p>We had not more than got our portion of<br/>
the night through when we were joined by five men from the <br/>
camp who crossed in a boat and were sent by President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
to assist us making eleven of us in all and we divided one force</p>",
42658.0,228,,"<p>accordingly. The night however passed off in peace and ^no^ disturbance from<br/>
hostile Indians.</p>

<p>The morning when it came was pleasant and Professor<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] took <strike>and</strike> ^an^ observation on the south bank of the fording place on the [[Loup Fork, Nebraska Territory|Loop<br/>
Fork]]. <strike>and</strike> The Lattitude was found to be 4^1^<strike>4</strike>° 22' 37""</p>

<p>The camp on the other side were now<br/>
busy in devising plans to cross the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|River]]. They drew together<br/>
timber and rails to build two rafts and began to put it together but<br/>
some of the brethren made another trial to cross with waggons by<br/>
putting on several horse and mule teams.</p>

<p>They went a little higher up than we<br/>
did and got over with much less difficulty and the more the ground<br/>
as trod in the water the smoother and harder it grew. So the<br/>
whole encampment turned their waggons back to the ford and abbandoned<br/>
the raft. By unloading one half of the baggage they could cross<br/>
in safety and the whole came over by doubling teams and by<br/>
going back and forth until all were over each captain with his<br/>
ten assisting each other across. So in this way all Israel<br/>
who were present went over (not Jordan) but the Loop Fork of<br/>
the Platte River in safety without hurt to man or beast and<br/>
they felt thankful to God for his mercies and rejoiced that they<br/>
were on the south side of the river.</p>

<p>We all loaded up our waggons and<br/>
drove 4 miles and camped for the Sabbath on the bank of<br/>
the River and after our waggons were arranged the Twelve took<br/>
a walk on the high table land to make observations with our<br/>
glasses of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Sunday came with a pleasent morning.<br/>
The order of the Pioneer Camp was that there should be no fishing<br/>
hunting nor labour of any kind on The Sabbath except that<br/>
which was absolutely needed.</p>

<p>Four Antelopes appeared before us on<br/>
the plain on the opposite side of the river. We could see them</p>",
42658.0,229,,"<p>with the naked eye but much better through our spyglasses. This was the first<br/>
antelope I ever saw. About 10 o'<u>clock </u> 4 Elk also appeared on the opposite<br/>
side and we viewed them with our glasses and these were the first Elk<br/>
I had ever seen.</p>

<p>After making the Sabbath a day of rest <br/>
both for man and beast until 4 o'<u>clock</u> the Camp gathered together <br/>
for a meeting and were addressed by a number of the brethren; the<br/>
guards were placed out as usual to guard the Camp at night and a company<br/>
of hunters appointed to go forward of the company for game. There<br/>
were 7 horsemen and 10 footmen appointed and the quorum of<br/>
the Twelve had the privilage of joining than when they pleased.</p>

<p>Indian Attacks</p>

<p>Early in the morning before the break of day 2 Indians crept<br/>
upon their hands and knees approaching the camp to steal horses. They<br/>
got within 3 rods of the guard before they were discovered. The guard<br/>
first thought them to be wolves and snapped at them. They rose up and<br/>
ran. Two of the guards fired and 4 others rose up out of the grass.<br/>
The bugle was sounded and all arose to arms not knowing but there was<br/>
a large party near by; but no more were seen there.</p>

<p>I started out in the morning with the Hunters.<br/>
We saw 8 deer &amp; 4 antelopes but caught nothing. Eight miles travel and we<br/>
camped for noon. On the opposite of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] were relics of an old<br/>
Indian town.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we travelled 7 miles and camped<br/>
on [[Clear Creek, Nebraska Territory|Clear Creek]] with a hard gravel bottom the first of the kind we had<br/>
met on the road. We killed one wild goose and saw fresh signs of<br/>
buffalo where we camped being the first we had seen. Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]] and myself went on to a high bluff to view the country.</p>

<p>Just at dusk a tremd^i^ous alarm was<br/>
given through the Camp that Indians had cralled up and taken [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|Porter<br/>
Rockwell]] and his horse and made off with him. Many men mounted</p>",
42658.0,230,,"<p>their horses and made after hime with all speed but it was soon discovered <br/>
that Rockwell was in camp but that two horses were gone<br/>
D<u>r</u> Richard's and brother Little's. About 20 men mounted and<br/>
armed went in search of the horses.</p>

<p>On the morrow we continued our journey<br/>
a south course to try to get on the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte River]] came on to some<br/>
beautiful green grass saw a great quantity of Buffalo signs but<br/>
found no wood nor water. We baited our horses in a green<br/>
valley after 12 miles travel.</p>

<p>Just as we were starting in the afternoon<br/>
we rose unto a small bluff and saw two antelopes in the valley<br/>
before us. Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself were together. Bro<br/>
[[John Brown, b. 1820|Brown]] and another brother was on the other side of the hills and saw<br/>
them. Brother Brown first fired on one and the other man and<br/>
myself fired. We all hit him with our balls but he did<br/>
not fall; we rose up and cut his throat. This was</p>

<p>The First Antelope Killed.</p>

<p>He was dressed and put on board the waggons and we continued on<br/>
and in a short time saw three more at the top of a mound<br/>
looking at us. Brother Brown and myself went after them but<br/>
could not get them <strike>so we:</strike> so we turned about 10 degrees East of<br/>
South and went to the Creek and camped. Our cattle and horses<br/>
were very dry not finding any water through the day.</p>

<p>We had a heavy storm of thunder lightning<br/>
wind and some rain which lasted about an hour. A rifle <strike>ball</strike><br/>
went off in brother Brown's waggon by accident and the ball<br/>
went through a bag of clothes set it on fire then through the<br/>
waggon and broke the leg of a fine horse and the result was<br/>
the breaking up of one of the teams of the Pioneer Company.</p>

<p>Brother [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|Rockwell]] and 3 others had gone<br/>
in the morning again in search of the ho[r]ses which the Indians</p>",
42658.0,231,,"<p>were supposed to have stolen and on the edge of the evening they returned and reported<br/>
that the Indians had stolen them and that they had themselves been attacked by<br/>
15 Indians who were in ambush in the grass. They came upon them<br/>
determined to take their horse from them but the brethren kept them off<br/>
by their rifles and pistols. The Indians were armed with guns<br/>
and bows and when they found that they could not scare the brethren<br/>
they then professed friendship to get to them but the brethren were resolute<br/>
^and determined^ not to move but to fight rather though only 4 to 15. The Indians<br/>
finally rushed upon them to ^catch^ <strike>ketch</strike> the horses by the bits and the brethren<br/>
drew their pistols upon them determined to fire and do their best and the <br/>
Indians seeing their determination broke and ran but fired their guns<br/>
upon the brethren. The balls whistled around them but no one<br/>
was injured. The Brethren did not return the fire not wishing<br/>
to kill any if they could help it.</p>

<p>(28)</p>

<p><u>28</u> Next morning we travelled to [[Grand Island, Hall County, unorganized U.S. Territory|Grand Island]]<br/>
and moved on its banks. I went out with the hunters but we caught<br/>
nothing but a wolf and a goose. We journeyed 6 miles in the <br/>
afternoon and camped on Wood Creek formed a circle put our horses<br/>
inside and had a good defence. We saw plenty of deer run across<br/>
on the Island but President [[Brigham Young|Young]] thought it not prudent to travel up<br/>
the Island hunting lest we should come upon an Indian ambush.</p>

<p><strike>29</strike> 29 A cold morning on the morrow and we started<br/>
at 5 o'clock without feeding drove three miles and breakfasted. The<br/>
hunters went up the Grand Island and found it well supplied with rushes<br/>
and cottonwood. [[Wood Creek, Nebraska Territory|Wood Creek]] was heavily wooded for this country and<br/>
we were beginning to get a good supply of grass for our horses and<br/>
cattle.</p>

<p>We travelled 8 miles and moved and then 10 miles<br/>
farther and camped on the borders of Grand Island which at this place<br/>
was thickly covered with rushes upon which we fed our horses.</p>

<p>I went on to the Island with the hunters<br/>
and saw about 30 antelopes and 8 deer. The antelope would play<br/>
around on the large plains and keep out of our way so that we</p>",
42658.0,232,,""">May 1st 1847</time></p>

<p>This was an interesting day to the Hunters of the <br/>
Camp of Israel who put out and the camp started on the journey <br/>
before breakfast travelled 6 miles and camped on the prairie in<br/>
sight of</p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Herd</u> <u>of</u> <u>Buffalo</u> <u>Feeding on the Bluff</u> <u>to our</u> <u>right</u><br/>
They were about 200. Three only of the hunters started out after<br/>
them who rode near and left their horses and crawled upon them<br/>
to get a shot but they frightened the herd and they ran away.</p>

<p>A little before the main herd being<br/>
seen three Bulls were discovered on the bluff. [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|OP. Rockwell]] and two<br/>
others went after them and wounded two but got neither.</p>

<p>We had not travelled more than two miles<br/>
farther before we discovered another large herd five miles ahead of<br/>
us. The hunters gathered together and held a council and<br/>
waited until the camp came up. We were determined to get<br/>
some of the Buffalo if possible.</p>

<p>We travelled with the camp until within<br/>
a mile of the herd when a halt was made and 15 hunters<br/>
started out. [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] and myself of the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve were with them. We all travelled together on to the Bluff<br/>
within a few rods of the herd and then divided out. Brother<br/>
[[Thomas Grover|Grover]] and [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] went together into the Bluff; OP. Rockwell<br/>
and brother [[John Brown|Brown]] took the entire left and so we divided into <br/>
companies on the righ left and centre. I was with the company<br/>
in the centre of the herd</p>",
42658.0,233,,"<p>We all made a charge upon them from the Bluffs and<br/>
rushed on to the plain. The herd ran very fast down the ruff bluffs into<br/>
the plain but when we reached the plain we soon overtook them and each<br/>
company singled out its game. We made choice of cows generally; then<br/>
rushed up by the side of them and fired upon them with our pistols<br/>
such as horse pistols &amp; rifle pistols which we found much better to<br/>
carry that rifles which were cumbersome running.</p>

<p>The first we gave chaise to was a Buffalo<br/>
cow with her calf. I rode by the side of her and fired two balls<br/>
which took effect and the other brethren with me also fired until she<br/>
was killed. We cut her throat.</p>

<p>I then ran my horse to the assistance of another<br/>
party who had wounded one and that was also soon dispatched. I<br/>
then saw that [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|O.P. Rockwell]] had three bulls at bay on the prairie and<br/>
Brother [[John Pack|Pack]] and myself ran our horses to his assistance and brother<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] came up at the same time.</p>

<p>We surrounded them and commenced firing<br/>
upon them. They bolted a-head. I put spurs to my horse and<br/>
ran in front and was in about a rod of them when they all pitched<br/>
at me and gave me chase for fight. I had to be quick to get<br/>
out of the way but I soon cleared them. Two broke for the bluff<br/>
and brother [[John Brown|Brown]] put for them but Rockwell Kimball Pack and <br/>
myself stuck to the old bull. I fired 2 balls into him, Bro<br/>
Kimball one and Bro Pack one and the bull fell dead and we<br/>
cut his throat. We also shot a calf that was with him.</p>

<p>By this time the two that had left us and<br/>
after which Brother Brown was gone was more than a mile distant<br/>
in the Bluffs. Brother Kimball and myself gave chase to<br/>
them and when we were within 20 rods of the bluff we saw<br/>
two come out and run for the main herd to which we gave chase<br/>
for awhile but they were fresh and my horse had ran nearly<br/>
ten miles in the chase; so we gave up the pursuit.</p>

<p>I returned to Brother Brown in the Bluff</p>",
42658.0,234,,"<p>and found that one of the bulls to which he gave chase was ^wounded^ <strike>nearly ^dead^ killed</strike><br/>
and had laid down but Brother [[John Brown|Brown]] having no more powder or ball<br/>
before I a<strike>fl</strike>rrived the bull had got up again and ran into the herd on the<br/>
Bluff. So we all returned on our chase ground to gather up the<br/>
meat we had killed being 3 cows ^3^ <strike>one</strike> bull[s] and five calfs making<br/>
eleven in all.</p>

<p>Brother [[Soloman Hancock|Soloman Hancock]] went out in the morning<br/>
to kill buffalo on foot. He did not come in at night and we<br/>
felt concerned about him; but in the morning he returned having<br/>
killed a 3 year old cow and watched her during the night to<br/>
keep the wolves from the eating her. Three wolves came upon<br/>
him. He shot one and the rest ran away.</p>

<p>This made 12 Buffalo in all that<br/>
the Hunters <strike>which</strike> killed on their first day's Buffalo chase and<br/>
we considered this pretty well seeing that we were all strangers to<br/>
the Buffalo hunt and but very few of us had ever seen one before<br/>
in our lives.</p>

<p>We dressed our meat and waggons came<br/>
from the camp to take it in.</p>

<p>A part of our chase was through an immense<br/>
prairie dog town nearly ten miles long and 2 wide with burrows<br/>
nearly at every rod and great danger of the horses steping into<br/>
them and falling. My horse ran into me and was near falling<br/>
but no harm was met by any of the hunters. This was the<br/>
first Buffalo hunt I ever took part in or saw.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday and all were<br/>
busy cooking and saving their meat and in the afternoon we moved<br/>
three miles up for better feed and camped by the side of a large<br/>
slough of water. Our last camping place was at the head of<br/>
[[Grand Island, Hall County, unorganized U.S. Territory|Grand Island]]. Professor [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] took an observation and found it<br/>
to agree with Fremont's observation taken two miles south of our<br/>
camping ground on the south side of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]].</p>

<p>Soon after we camped a herd of</p>",
42658.0,235,,"<p>Buffalo came from the Bluff to the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] to drink within about 2 miles and then<br/>
returned <strike>to the Bluffs</strike>. Some were anxious to go after them but as it was<br/>
Sunday President [[Brigham Young|Young]] thought it best to let them be until to morrow.</p>

<p>The Indians set fire to the prairie before us which<br/>
burned rapidly over a large region of country. Brothers Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] <br/>
and others went in the evening several miles on the road to examine the fire<br/>
and other things.</p>

<p>Monday morning the hunters were called 20 <br/>
in number to go into the Bluff for a still hunt for buffalo and other<br/>
game. We started out with two waggons to bring in the game.</p>

<p>I had taken a severe cold which had settled in<br/>
my side where my bones were broken last fall and it made me sick and<br/>
I was unfit for the hunt yet I started with the Hunters though I<br/>
had jarred myself badly in my hard buffalo chase on Saturday and<br/>
was now feeling its effects.</p>

<p>At the same time the hunters started another<br/>
company was formed to explore the route and see if we could get grass<br/>
for our horses as the Indians had been burning it for several<br/>
days.</p>

<p>When the Hunters reached the bluffs they divided<br/>
into two parties 10 in each and we travelled some 10 miles back and<br/>
forth over the hills and saw no game except antelopes and wolves.</p>

<p>I felt so unwell that I concluded to return to<br/>
camp and [[Amasa Mason Lyman|A Lyman]] and three others were with me. We sat down <br/>
upon the edge of the Bluff in sight of the camp to rest ourselves when<br/>
a company of horsemen approached in haste bearing a red flag. When<br/>
they got within a mile of us we trailed our arms and went down<br/>
to meet them and were informed that the party who had gone up the<br/>
river had come upon an encampent of about 400 Indians warriors<br/>
and a party of about 100 had followed them down a ravine to cut<br/>
of their retreat. We went into the camp.</p>

<p>The horsemen had come to call in the Hunters<br/>
and in their return they came across a herd of Buffalo and they</p>",
42658.0,236,,"<p>brought into camp three calves and 4 antelope.</p>

<p>There was a good guard during the night kept and<br/>
early in the morning the cannon was fired twice to let the Indians know that we<br/>
were awake. I had a very severe night with my side.</p>

<p>We started on our journey in the morning <br/>
five ^waggons^ <strike>agons</strike> abreast making five roads. This was to be in readiness<br/>
in case of an attack from Indians.</p>

<p>We travelled 3 miles and saw some waggons<br/>
on the opposite side of the river going down the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]]. Soon one of<br/>
the men waded the river and came to see us to know who we were.<br/>
He informed us they were traders from [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Laramie]] that they<br/>
were 16 days from that place the grass good on the South side<br/>
but burned up on the North side by the Indians. He would take<br/>
letters for us to [[Mr. Sarpee|Sarpee]] who lived near [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]]; so the<br/>
camp stoped and wrote 52 letters to our families.</p>

<p>I was ahead of the company with <br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] taking observations and did not know of the matter<br/>
until the time was nearly up and I then in great hast scribbled<br/>
a few lines to my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]. An epistle was written to the<br/>
Church and three brethren accompanied the Frenchman across<br/>
the Platte to the other men of <strike>t</strike> his company <strike>who were</strike> 9 in all<br/>
who informed the brethren that they had not seen an Indian<br/>
since they left Laramie that there was a ferry at the fort &amp;<br/>
and agreed to take our letters safe.</p>

<p>We drove on three miles farther and<br/>
bailed our teams until the brethren returned from the French<br/>
traders when they made a report to the camp of what was said<br/>
to them. A council of the whole company of Pioneers was<br/>
then called to decide whether we should cross the Platt or continue<br/>
up the North side.</p>

<p>We were convinced that it would be better<br/>
for us as a company to cross the river on to the old travelling<br/>
road to Laramie as there was good grass on that side</p>",
42658.0,237,,"<p>while the Indians were burning it all off on the North side of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] where<br/>
we were travelling; but when we took into consideration the situation of the next companies<br/>
and the thousands who would follow after and as we were the Pioneers and had<br/>
not our wives and children with us we thought it best to keep on the North<br/>
side of the River and brave the difficulties of burning prairies. Thus<br/>
a road would be made that should stand as a permanent route for the<br/>
Saints independant of the old emigration route and the River would<br/>
seperate the emigrant companies that they need not quarrel for wood<br/>
grass or water and when our next company should come along the<br/>
grass would be much better than on the south side as it would grow<br/>
by that time.</p>

<p>These were the views that the Pioneers assembled<br/>
in a mass council took and the vote was called and it was unanimously<br/>
resolved to go on the North side of the river. So the camp again<br/>
moved on; but during the moving Col. [[Stephen Markham|Markham]] drilled the men<br/>
in a military capacity and they unshiped the cannon and carried<br/>
it on wheels.</p>

<p>The Frenchman informed us that he never saw<br/>
so many buffalo on the route before as this season and that they had to<br/>
stop several times to let the herds pass. We saw many deer<br/>
and antelope this day and a few buffalo and at night camped<br/>
near a herd but a short distance from us. It was also afterwards<br/>
found that the alarm of the 3rd about the 400 Indian warriors was<br/>
a false one and that a man had been frightened by a herd of antelope<br/>
supposing them in the distance to be Indians.</p>

<p>The change from salt to fresh meat was<br/>
affecting many in the camp.</p>

<p>In the morning we had to keep a guard out to<br/>
prevent a herd of buffalo from mixing up with our cattle. Two bulls<br/>
at noon were approaching our herd of cows and men had to go out and<br/>
drive them off. In the afternoon the brethren killed one<br/>
cow and 5 calves and brought in a bull calf alive with the intentions<br/>
of raising it. It would try hard to bunt the men and dogs over</p>",
42658.0,238,,"<p>and some got hard raps. It was dead however the next day.</p>

<p>We stoped for the night but found the grass on<br/>
fire and had to return back one mile and camped on the bank of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] on<br/>
a spot that was just burned over except small patches. Some took their <br/>
horses on to an Island near by and cut down cottonwood for feed.</p>

<p>We started early next morning without feeding<br/>
(excepting a little corn) as there was no grass; travelled three miles and <br/>
left <strike>it</strike> in our rear the fire and breakfasted on a good spot of grass.</p>

<p>This morning the herds of buffalo speck both<br/>
sides of the river and the antelope was in great abundance some of which<br/>
would run into the camp. A young buffalo calf also came in and<br/>
followed us and we gave them some milk and left him.</p>

<p>We continued our journey seeing many <br/>
herds of buffalo &amp; antelope and one large herd of Elk. Two antelopes<br/>
were killed this morning but as there was so much meat in camp<br/>
it was thought best not to kill many more game until we needed it.</p>

<p>Dr [[Willard Richards|Richards]] [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and myself <br/>
walked up quite near several herds of Buffalo and examined them through <br/>
our glasses. They were shedding their coats. One bull had a mass<br/>
of wool swin[g]ing by his side like a loose robe.</p>

<p>Our herd of cows started to run among <br/>
the Buffalo but President [[Brigham Young|Young]] galloped his horse to separate them <br/>
and had great difficulty in doing so. He lost a spyglass in the chase<br/>
worth 40 dollars. The brethren hunted a long time for it but <br/>
could not find it.</p>

<p>We continued our journey among the herds <br/>
of buffalo and were not out of sight of them at all and they had <br/>
eaten the grass to such a degree that there was little remaining for <br/>
our cattle and timber also we not but seldom met. We camped at<br/>
night near a heard of buffalo that reached as far as our eyes could<br/>
extent. This day the camp made 20 miles.</p>

<p>Next day I should judge we saw ten <br/>
thousand buffalo and came near one large herd with an unusual</p>",
42658.0,239,,"<p>number of calves yearlings and two years old. We saw several large ones mired<br/>
dead wolves had commenced eating some. Wolves on every hand were seen<br/>
following the herd to eat those who died by wounds &amp;c.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and others rode out in the evening a<br/>
few miles to search out the road. There was some rain.</p>

<p>The next morning was a pleasant morning and not<br/>
so cold and windy as the day before. A start was not made until 10 o'clock<br/>
as the teams needed rest and feed bad. I rode forward to day with the Twelve<br/>
and others and the sights of buffalo that our eyes beheld was most astonishing.<br/>
Thousands upon thousands would crowd together as they came from the bluffs<br/>
to the bottom land to go to the river and sloughs to drink until the river<br/>
and land upon both sides of it looked as though the face of the earth was<br/>
alive and moving like the waves of the sea. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] remarked<br/>
that he had heard many buffalo tales told but never expected to behold<br/>
what his eyes now saw. The half had not been told him.</p>

<p>When we stoped at noon many of the<br/>
buffalo walked along beside our waggons so that it would have been<br/>
easy to shoot them down. [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|O. P. Rockwell]] did shoot one through<br/>
the neck and she droped dead. It was a two year old heffer and good<br/>
meat. We had great difficulty in keeping our cattle and horses<br/>
from going among the herds and if they had got mixed it would have<br/>
been almost impossible to have ever got them again.</p>

<p>We travelled 11 1/4 miles this day until we<br/>
came to the bluffs that made down to the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|River]] and there we camped for<br/>
the night. Brother [[William Clayton|William Clayton]] had prepared a mile gage on<br/>
the hind wheel of his waggon so that the distance could be measured.</p>

<p>Brigham Young H. C. Kimball [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A Smith]] and myself went on to the highest bluffs near and took a<br/>
survey of the surrounding country without glasses; and the scene<br/>
before us north east and west as far as our vision extended looked<br/>
as rough as the sea in a storm with the ridges and valleys mostly<br/>
sand and scarcely any green thing upon it excepting a little scattering<br/>
grass and the Spanish soap root which the Mexicans use for washing</p>",
42658.0,240,,""">9</time>th as we had no feed around <sup>us</sup> our<br/>
teams passed across the bluffs 4 miles and camped for the day. I<br/>
wrote two letters one to brother [[James Ferguson|Ferguson]] and the other to Brother [[James Bevin|Bevin]]<br/>
for brother <strike>[[John Mills Woolley|Wolsey]]</strike> ^Wolsey^ to take with him to <strike>[[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Pueblo]]</strike> ^Pueblo^. We had a<br/>
meeting and a good one. The Spirit of God ruled over the camp.<br/>
Peace quietness and contentment pervaded almost every breast.</p>

<p>The Twelve met and it was thought<br/>
best not for the brethren to start for Pueblo until they arrived<br/>
at [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]]. I rode with the Twelve and others 4 miles<br/>
up the river and saw large herds of buffalo come to water.</p>

<p>Monday morning was cool. Before leaving<br/>
the camp ground a letter was written to the next camp which<br/>
should follow put into a small box nailed to a post 12 feet<br/>
long one end of which was planted firmly in the ground and<br/>
standing as a guide board with the following words inscribed:<br/>
""Open this box and you will find a letter; 316 miles to Winter<br/>
Quarters; Pioneers; Lattitude 41°. Our friends we had<br/>
no doubt would be glad to get the letter as it contained an account<br/>
of our journey.</p>

<p>We travelled 6 miles and nooned and then<br/>
travelled 4 more and camped for the night. Our teams was<br/>
week in consequence of there being no grass for several<br/>
days. It being eaten all up. There was one buffalo—one<br/>
deer and one hare brought into camp to day by the Hunters<br/>
which was distributed among the company. We had what<br/>
fresh meat we wanted daily.</p>

<p>The grass we found somewhat better<br/>
to day and we met but few buffalo but passed through<br/>
some miles of dead grass which we burned to give new<br/>
feed to the next company. It made a great fire indeed</p>",
42658.0,241,,"<p>The Hunting Ground of the Sioux</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we found ourselves travelling<br/>
over the hunting ground of the Sioux. Some 8 or ten days prior there<br/>
had been a large band there of from 500 to 1000. This we judged from<br/>
the signs around us. They had taken the brains out of the large<br/>
buffalo their hides generally and some of the meat and had broken<br/>
up the bones for the marrow. One Hundred calves we found<br/>
dead in one place with nothing taken but the tongues legs to<br/>
their knees and entrails. At another place 35 calves were<br/>
found dead and washed in heaps where the buffalo had been chased<br/>
across <strike>the</strike> the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] and had ran over the calves in rising the bank<br/>
of the river.<br/>
I found on the bluff their medicine bag<br/>
tied to a stick 6 feet long struck up in the bank; also a saddle<br/>
tied to a large buffalo dung I supposed to show the next party which<br/>
way the buffalo had gone.</p>

<p>I had left my horse to feed in the valley<br/>
while I went on the Bluff to view the country and he started off<br/>
not seeing the camp took the back track and I had to run after<br/>
him and in doing this I ran through the great encampment of<br/>
the Sioux where their lodges had been on their hunting expedition.<br/>
Here I left my gun and followed my horse until I overtook<br/>
him &amp; with the assistance of brother [[John Sherman Fowler|Fowler]] who came out of the<br/>
encampment I stoped him and rode back got my gun and<br/>
examined the ground and judged that there had been five hundred<br/>
lodges. There were acres of ground covered with buffalo<br/>
wool where they had dressed their skins buffalo wolf &amp;c<br/>
I brought in a good dressed white wolf skin.</p>

<p>Many of the brethren went out the next<br/>
day to visit the Indian encampment and brought in parts<br/>
of robes leather &amp;c which had been left.</p>",
42658.0,242,,"<p>We travelled to day eleven miles. The bluffs<br/>
for the first time on the North Fork came bald to the river so that<br/>
we had to go over the bluffs with our waggons.</p>

<p>There is one thing concerning the [[Platte River, Nebraska Territory|Platt River]]<br/>
worthy of note. It is much of the way a mile in width generally<br/>
covered with water but very shallow. When the south wind blows<br/>
hard the water all rushes to the north shore so that one would<br/>
suppose there was a great rise in the tide but let the wind shift<br/>
and blow hard from the north and the water immediately<br/>
recedes from the north shore until one can walk across two<br/>
thirds of the River on bare ground. Thus the River constantly<br/>
ebbs and flows like the tide according to the wind.</p>

<p>Early next morning I went out to hunt<br/>
Buffalo returned to breakfast and started out agian with [[Phineas Howe Young|Phineas<br/>
Young]]. I got lost among the Bluffs but found my way out<br/>
again. Brother Phineas shot a buck antelope and I carried<br/>
him into camp. There were three antelopes and one buffalo<br/>
killed.</p>

<p>Some of the hunters thought they heard Indian<br/>
guns during the night on the opposite side of the river. An<br/>
Indian cralled up to a pair of mules that were tied together and<br/>
made a grab at them but the mules sprang and got away<br/>
One of the gards shot at him and he ran. All the horses<br/>
were then brought into the circle of our camp and the cannon<br/>
prepared for firing but seeing no one it was not fired.</p>

<p>A large number of barefoot tracks<br/>
were seen next morning supposed to be of the Indians who came<br/>
down last night to steal our horses. We travelled eight<br/>
miles during the day: in the morning our road was over the<br/>
Bluffs with cold North wind and rain but we had the best grass<br/>
we had found on the road. We camped on the prairie. I<br/>
went out with some others to hunt got within about 30 rods<br/>
of the Buffalo and shot at the neck of one. The ball entered</p>",
42658.0,243,,""">16</time>th was still cloudy and a cold wind. With<br/>
Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|Rockwell]] and [[Roswell Stephens|Stephens]] I rode 4 miles<br/>
over the Bluffs to pick out a road for the Pioneers to get again on the<br/>
bottom land. We had a good meeting in the afternoon; and the<br/>
laws of the camp were read. One of the brethren had shot an<br/>
antelope and a buffalo which was against the rules of the camp<br/>
to go hunting on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Monday was warm and pleasant but our road<br/>
was hard: two and a half miles through land bluffs when we again<br/>
struck the bottom 4 1/2 miles from our last camping place.<br/>
The hunters brought in 3 buffalo which detained the camp sometime<br/>
to get and President Young was not pleased with it as we had<br/>
so much meat in camp. We saw large droves of deer in the<br/>
bottoms more than we had seen before. A young fawn was picked<br/>
up and brought into camp. I led the company of Pioneers<br/>
mostly through the bluffs in the morning before brothers Young<br/>
and Kimball came up when we rode together all day<br/>
picking out the road.</p>

<p>The camp was called together next day<br/>
and President Young sharply reproved the hunters for shooting<br/>
so much meat detaining the camp and for taking more life<br/>
than necessary and also the horsemen for their indifference in<br/>
picking out the road. He said there were but two who had<br/>
manifested any interest in helping him get the camp along<br/>
Afterwards the horsemen went forward to pick out the road instead<br/>
of going hunting and I did not hear a gun fired during the day.</p>

<p>The following day we met the worst<br/>
sand hill on the journey and what made it worse was that the<br/>
rain was pouring down upon us continually; and we had more rain<br/>
during the day and evening than ever before on our route. I rode</p>",
42658.0,244,,"<p>forward during the day in the rain picking out the road. We travelled<br/>
eight miles.</p>

<p>Next morning seven miles were made and<br/>
we moved opposite [[Ash Creek, Nebraska Territory|Ash Creek]] on the South side of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] where<br/>
the [[Oregon Trail, Nebraska Territory|Origon]] raod first strikes the North fork of the Platt. Several<br/>
of the brethren went over in the boat which we were taking along<br/>
to examine the rocky bluffs road creek &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we travelled 8 3/4 miles<br/>
and camped for the night. We had a very good road most of the day<br/>
on the bank of the river. There was a good bit of rock bluff on<br/>
both sides of the river and some on the South side was formed into<br/>
natural terraces rotundas squares &amp;c from 50 to a hundred feet<br/>
high and looked like good foundations for forts fortifications and strong<br/>
holds. They resemble the works of art and look something like<br/>
the old castles of [[England|England]] and [[Scotland|Scotland]]. They were level on the<br/>
top. There is a beautiful Cedar Island in the river a<br/>
short distance above Ash Creek which is a good landmark to<br/>
show travellers where the Oregon road strikes the river.</p>

<p>Before we left the encampment next<br/>
morning Bro [[William Clayton|Clayton]] put up a guide board for the benefit of<br/>
the next company bearing the inscription, ""From [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]]<br/>
409 miles; from the Junction 93 1/4 [[Cedar Bluffs, Saunders County, Nebraska Territory|Cedar Bluff]] 36 1/2<br/>
[[Ash Hollow, Garden County, Nebraska Territory|Ash Hollow]] 8 miles and 133 from [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Laramie]].""</p>

<p>We travelled 7 1/2 miles and nooned and<br/>
eight more and camped for the night. I killed a bagger with<br/>
the jaw bone of a buffalo.</p>

<p>Just as we got to our camping place two<br/>
Indians came from the Bluffs riding towards us and made signs for<br/>
us to come to them. Several of the brethren went. It was<br/>
a Sioux Indian and his squaw. They talked by signs and<br/>
went away.</p>

<p>Our road was very straight on the morrow's<br/>
travel but we came over 2 1/2 miles of the worst sand hill that we</p>",
42658.0,245,,""">23</time>rd. In company<br/>
with Brigham [[Brigham Young|Young]] and the Twelve I visited the top of the highest bluff<br/>
ruins that lie opposite our encampment which was truly a curiosity. We<br/>
had a fair view of [[Chimney Rock, Nebraska Territory|Chimney Rock]] from where we were. I carried a bleached<br/>
Buffalo's head on the top and we wrote upon it our names and distance<br/>
from several places. [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] took a Barometrical observation on<br/>
the solitary cedar tree on the top of the bluff ruins.</p>

<p>The camp met at half past eleven in the<br/>
morning for Sabbath services. [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] addressed the meeting<br/>
followed by President Young who said he was satisfied that the<br/>
Lord was with us and leading us. He had never seen a company<br/>
of people more united than the camp had been thus far on the journey;<br/>
that we should pluck the fruit of this mission to all eternity; that<br/>
he had many things to teach us but could not do it only in a stake<br/>
of Zion; but he was well satisfied with himself his brethren the Twelve<br/>
and the camp at large. One thing he would say to the praise of<br/>
all and that was that not one had refused to obey his council on the<br/>
road. His peace with God was continually like a river and he felt<br/>
that the fruit of peace rested upon the whole camp.</p>

<p>Several others spoke and the meeting was then<br/>
dismissed.</p>

<p>We intended to have rode out in the evening but<br/>
saw that a storm was gathering. It began to blow very hard and<br/>
it was as much as we could do to save our waggon bows and covers<br/>
from being smashed. It continued for about an hour and then<br/>
rained for another hour accompanied by hail. I covered all my horses<br/>
with all the blankets I could get and got up several times in the night<br/>
to see them. It rained occasionaly and the horses shook with cold but</p>",
42658.0,246,,"<p>morning came and all was alive again and we continued our journey</p>

<p>As soon as we camped at noon two Indians<br/>
came to the camp. They were Sioux and well dressed and clean. We<br/>
gave them dinner and they left.</p>

<p>We camped at night near the quicksand<br/>
mountain making 16 1/2 miles that day. I rode about two<br/>
miles forward to find grass and a camping ground and on my<br/>
return saw about 30 Sioux plunge their horses into the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] on<br/>
the opposite side and make towards us. I rode with several<br/>
others to the river and met them as they came out. They shook<br/>
hands with us very friendly. The chief unfurled a large American<br/>
flag with the Eagle stars and stripes and presented me a letter,<br/>
written in French which we however made out. They were all<br/>
well dressed and the chief was in a military coat. The brethren<br/>
brought a white flag and planted it by the side of theirs. They wanted to go into camp. We proposed<br/>
for five of them to go and the rest to remain but they all wanted<br/>
to go so we let them and gave them supper. They remained in camp all<br/>
night but were good and stole nothing.</p>

<p>Some little trading was done with the<br/>
Sioux next morning and we gave them breakfast. They behaved well and<br/>
when we started crossed the river. I had to keep my carriage today<br/>
having the rheumatism in shoulders &amp; back and teeth ache.</p>

<p>We nooned next day in good grass 2 miles<br/>
above [[Chimney Rock, Nebraska Territory|Chimney Rock]] and I rode <strike>to day</strike> with brothers [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] to look out the road. By an imperfect measurement by a<br/>
trigonometrical observation by the sextant Professor [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] made<br/>
Chimney Rock to be 260 feet above the level of the river.</p>

<p>A Panic Among our Teams</p>

<p>Just before camping at noon while travelling on<br/>
a smooth Prairie an Indian horse that was bought of the Sioux<br/>
ran away with a singletree at his heals and gave a tremendous</p>",
42658.0,247,,"<p>fright to the cows oxen and horses and in an instant a dozen or more waggons<br/>
were darting by each other like lightning and the horses and mules flying as<br/>
it were over the ground some turning to the right and some to the left and<br/>
some ran into other waggons. The horses and mules that brother [[John Sherman Fowler|Fowler]]<br/>
was driving leaped with all speed <strike>with</strike> he holding the bits and brother [[Jesse Carter Little|Little]]<br/>
the lines darted by my carriage like electricity and came within one inch<br/>
of a collision with my wheels which would have made a wreck. Another<br/>
waggon with a pair of mules and one yoke of cattle dashed by which would<br/>
also have smashed my carriage had they looked. By this time my<br/>
own horses started to run but was held by the driver. Fowlers waggon<br/>
continued regardless of rough or smooth ground about 50 rods be ^being^ draged<br/>
the whole distance by the bit which was the case with many others<br/>
but all were soon stoped and returned to their lines without accident<br/>
which appeared truly a miracle. A person can hardly conceive the<br/>
power manifested by anamals especially mules in such a fright<br/>
and it gave us some idea what an Indian yell would do in a camp<br/>
with teams hitched to waggons.</p>

<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself picked the road<br/>
during our journey of the following <strike>morning</strike> ^morning^ and in the afternoon I piloted<br/>
as straight as any road yet made on the whole route and picked out a camping<br/>
ground on the bank of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] in good feed.</p>

<p>It showed he understood that we were pioneering<br/>
a road for the whole House of Israel to travel in for many a year<br/>
to come and therefore that it required the greatest care in marking<br/>
the route.</p>

<p>A cold rainy morning followed and we<br/>
concluded not to start until it stoped so we remained till 10 o'clock<br/>
and travelled 11 1/2 miles and camped for the night.</p>

<p>During the evening President [[Brigham Young|Young]] called<br/>
at my fire and seeing several brethren playing dominoes in a waggon<br/>
near by he began to teach saying that the Devil was getting power<br/>
over the camp which had for several days given way to cards<br/>
dominoes &amp;c and that if they did not spedily repent their works</p>",
42658.0,248,,"<p>labours and journey would be in vain. [[Brigham Young|He]] said that to be sure the camp<br/>
didin't quarrel for the Devil would not set them at that as long as he<br/>
could draw them gradually away from duty and fill them with<br/>
nonsense and folly for the Devil was very cunning in winning away<br/>
the people of God. I felt the force of his remarks.</p>

<p>During the evening I went into Dr [[Willard Richards|Richard's]]<br/>
waggon and read a chapter in the Book of Mormon and prayed with<br/>
them after which President Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] Willard Richards<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] and Wilford Woodruff met in council in brother Brigham's<br/>
waggon and President Young wrote some of the word of the Lord<br/>
concerning the camp and expressed his views and feelings; that<br/>
they must spedily repent or they would be cursed that they were<br/>
forgetting their mission and that he would rather travel with ten<br/>
righteous men who would keep the commandments of God than<br/>
the whole camp while in a carless manner and forgetting<br/>
God. We stayed together till ten o'clock</p>

<p>The Pioneers Chastised</p>

<p>Next morning President Young called the camp<br/>
together and required each captain seperately to call out his men and when<br/>
all were present except two who had gone out hunting he addressed<br/>
them something near in the following words:</p>

<p>""I think I will take as my text to<br/>
preach my sermon from—<u>I am about to revolt from travelling<br/>
with this camp any farther with the Spirit they now possess.</u></p>

<p>""I had rather risk myself among the savages<br/>
with ten men who are men of faith—men of mighty prayer—men of<br/>
God than to be with this whole camp when they forget God and<br/>
turn their hearts to folly and wickedness yea I would rather be<br/>
alone and I am now resolved not to go any father with the<br/>
camp unless you will covenant to humble yourselves before<br/>
the Lord and serve Him and cease your folly and wickedness</p>",
42658.0,249,,"<p>For a week past nearly the whole camp has been card playing and checkers and<br/>
dominoes have occupied the attention of the brethren and dancing and nigering<br/>
and hooing down all has been the test continually.</p>

<p>Now it is time to quit it. There has been<br/>
trials and lawsuits upon every nonsensical thing and if this is suffered to<br/>
go on it will not be but a short time before you are fighting ^knocking^ <strike>mowing</strike> each<br/>
other down and taking life. It is high time it was stoped.</p>

<p>I do not want to hear anymore such reports <br/>
as I heard last Sunday of men going to meeting and preaching to the<br/>
rest after playing cards until meeting time. You are a pretty set of<br/>
men going to look out a location among the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|mountains]] for a resting<br/>
place for the Saints even the whole Church of God who have been<br/>
driven out from the Gentiles and rejected of them. And after you<br/>
have established a location you are then going out to preach the<br/>
Gospel <u>and</u> seal salvation upon the House of Israel and gather the nations.</p>

<p>How would you look if they should know <br/>
your conduct and ask you what you did when you went to seek out<br/>
Zion and find a resting place for the Saints where the standard of<br/>
the Kingdom of God could be reared and her banners unfurled <strike>for</strike><br/>
for the nations to gather unto?</p>

<p>""Did you spend a good deal of your time<br/>
in dancing pitching quoit jumping wrestling and the like? Yes, yes.<br/>
Did you play cards dice checkers dominoes? O! Yes.</p>

<p>What <strike>y</strike>could you do with yourselves?<br/>
Why you would think from the glance of the eyes of God angels and<br/>
men even wicked men. Then are you not ashamed of yourselves<br/>
for practising these things? Yes you are, and you must quit<br/>
it.""</p>

<p>After speaking somewhat lengthy upon these<br/>
matters President Young called Twelve together and the High<br/>
Priests Seventies and Elders and there was found to be eight of<br/>
the quorum of the Twelve 18 High Priests 80 Seventies and<br/>
eight Elders.</p>",
42658.0,250,,"<p>After this was done President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said unto the<br/>
Twelve—</p>

<p>""I[f] you are willing to humble yourselves before the Lord<br/>
and covenant to do right and walk humbly before Him make<br/>
it manifest by raising the right hand.""</p>

<p>Then each one raised his hand and<br/>
the same question was put to the High Priests Seventies Elders and<br/>
Members and all universally covenentted with uplifted hands to<br/>
humble themselves before the Lord repent of their sins and keep<br/>
His commandments.</p>

<p>President Young then spoke of those who<br/>
were not in the Church as there was some present. They would<br/>
be protected in their rights but they must not introduce wickedness<br/>
into the camp for it would not be suffered. He also spoke<br/>
of the standard and ensign that would be reared in Zion.</p>

<p>Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] followed and said that<br/>
the words of President Young was as the word of the Lord unto<br/>
him and just as binding us though it was a written revelation<br/>
and it was just as binding upon the whole camp as it was<br/>
upon him and he urged the Pioneers to give heed to the teachings<br/>
that had been given.</p>

<p>[[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]] remarked that if the Saints had<br/>
leasure hours they could spend them at much better advantage then in<br/>
playing cards as there was a world of knowledge and science to be<br/>
obtained and every moment should be improved in storing the mind<br/>
with some good principle. And he acknowledged the teachings we <br/>
had received to be of the Lord.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff said: ""A burned<br/>
child dreaded the fire. He had not forgotten his journey in<br/>
the camp of Zion in 1834 and should he live to the age of<br/>
[[Methuselah (OT)|Methusalah]] he should not forget the hour when the Prophet and<br/>
Seer [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] stood upon the waggon wheel and addressed<br/>
that camp and said that because they had not hearkened unto</p>",
42658.0,251,,""">30</time>th</p>

<p>We set this Sabbath apart for prayer and fasting.<br/>
In the morning I shaved cleansed my body put on clean<br/>
clothing &amp; read a chapter in the Book of Mormon humbled myself<br/>
before the Lord and poured out my soul in prayer before ^Him^ <strike>the Lord</strike><br/>
and His Spirit descended upon me and I was blessed and prepared for<br/>
the service of the day and then I spent some time in writing<br/>
in my Journal.</p>

<p>The camp had a prayer meeting in the<br/>
morning and met again for public meeting. President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] with the Quorum of the Twelve and a few others went<br/>
into the valley of the hills and prayed according to the order of the</p>",
42658.0,252,,""">June the 2</time>nd in company with the Twelve<br/>
and others I crossed the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] to visit the Fort. We examined<br/>
[[Fort John, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort St John]] which was now evacuated but the walls were still standing<br/>
The dimensions of Fort St John were 144 by 132 outside and inside contained<br/>
16 rooms. The largest on the North side was 98 feet long 47 wide<br/>
The [[Oregon Trail, Nebraska Territory|Oregon trail]] ran one rod from S. W. corner of the fort.</p>",
42658.0,253,,"<p>We next visited [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Laramie]] then occupied by 38 persons<br/>
mostly French who have married the Sioux. [[Mr. Burdow|Mr Burdow]] was the superintendant.<br/>
This fort was 168 by 116 outside with 6 rooms inside. It was quite a pleasant<br/>
situation for a fort.</p>

<p>Mr Burdow was a Frenchman. He received us kindly<br/>
and invited us into a large setting room and gave us all the information<br/>
he could in relation to our route and furnished us with his flat bottom boat<br/>
on reasonable terms to assist us in ferrying the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]]. He informed us<br/>
that Gov. [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]] and his men had much to say against the Mormons and<br/>
cautioned him to take care of his horses and cattle &amp;c lest we should<br/>
steal them and tried to prejudice him all he could against us. Burdow<br/>
said that Boggs company was quarreling all the time and most of <strike>his</strike> them<br/>
had deserted him. He finally told Boggs and company that let the Mormons<br/>
be what they might they could not be worse than he and his men.</p>

<p>After conversing with Mr Burdow a length of<br/>
time we got into the flat bottom boat about 20 of us and went down the<br/>
Laramie Fork to its mouth about 2 miles and up the Platte 1/2 a mile<br/>
to our camp. After dinner we met in council and decided that<br/>
[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] should go to [[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Pueblo]] with several other brethren to<br/>
meet the detachment of the Battalion that was there and for them<br/>
to come as soon as convenient to Laramie and follow our trail.</p>

<p>A very windy day followed but we commenced<br/>
before sunrise to ferry over our boats. My ten was the first that went<br/>
over.</p>

<p>We set up our blacksmiths shops in the old fort<br/>
to do our work and made fires to do our washing.</p>

<p>In the evening the Twelve and others went on to<br/>
the highest peak to view the surrounding country and on our return<br/>
we visited the Indian and French burying ground. The Indians were<br/>
laid upon a staging about 10 feet from the ground but the French<br/>
buried in the ground with crosses at their head being Catholics<br/>
and strong pickets around their burying place.</p>

<p>I wrote letters to Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]</p>",
42658.0,254,,""">6</time>th which we devoted<br/>
to prayer and fasting but the Missouri company of emigrants started on<br/>
in the morning.</p>

<p>The camp met for prayer meeting at 8 o'clock<br/>
and the Spirit of the Lord was with the people and met again for<br/>
preaching at 11 o'clock. We had a shower of rain and the meeting<br/>
closed. Another company of Missouri wagons 20 in number<br/>
passed us. The rain soon cleared off and our company moved<br/>
forward five miles and camped for the night on [[Bitter Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bitter Creek]].</p>

<p>The two Missouri companies which had<br/>
camped near us at night started before us in the morning and while<br/>
moving another company of 13 waggons passed us. We were in a <br/>
fair view of Laramie Peak with its snow covered top. We camped</p>",
42658.0,255,,"<p>for the night on the [[Horseshoe Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Horse Shoe Creek]] in the best feed we had met on our journey. The<br/>
hunters brought in two black tailed deer and one antelope.</p>

<p>Next day we formed a company of men and went forward<br/>
of <strike>comf</strike> our teams and cleared the road of stone. We used pick axes bars spades &amp;c<br/>
and it was a great help to our weak w<strike>g</strike>aggons.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we travelled 8 3/4 miles over the <br/>
most mountan<strike>e</strike>ous road on our way and then descended into the Valley and<br/>
camped for the night on [[La Bonte Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|<u>Labent </u>Creek]] with an abudance of timber water<br/>
and good grass.</p>

<p>Brother [[John Somers Higbee|John Higby]] went forward hunting and saw<br/>
the [[Missouri|Missouri]] companies of emigrants and when they started out they<br/>
had such strife one with another in trying to start first. They did not<br/>
stop to milk their cows and in clearning up their breakfast they strewed their<br/>
meal salt bacon short cake beans and other things upon the ground<br/>
throughout their encampment and when we came up 3 wolves were feeding<br/>
upon the fragments.</p>

<p>In coming over the hills today we found it<br/>
so cold it pierced us like Winter. On reaching the Valley we found<br/>
fires the companies in advance had built and we pilled on the wood<br/>
and soon got warm. An antelope lay before us which the hunters<br/>
had brought in. We carved it up with our knives forked it on<br/>
sticks roasted it and satisfied ourselves finely without the seasoning<br/>
of salt.</p>

<p>We started in the morning at 5 o'clock<br/>
into better feed a mile further on and turned out our teams. The<br/>
brethren did some trading with the hunters who camped near us.</p>

<p>At 7 o'clock 15 of our waggons was formed<br/>
into a company to go forward to make a boat to ferry the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Platte]].<br/>
They went forward and we followed them and the traders started at <br/>
the same time.</p>

<p>Soon another party of traders overtook us<br/>
who were direct from [[Santa Fe, Mexican Cession Territory|Santa Fee]]. They informed us that the Mormon<br/>
Battalion was at [[California|California]] went in Jan and that Capt. [[John Brown, b. 1820|Brown]] was</p>",
42658.0,256,,"<p>in [[Santa Fe, Mexican Cession Territory|Santa Fee]] for money for the detachment and would come on us soon as possible.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the next day Presidents [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] rode with us. Our detached company had not been heard<br/>
of since last night when they camped with the foremost company. We<br/>
camped this night at [[Deer Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Deer Creek]] had good feed and our horses and cattle<br/>
were gaining daily.</p>

<p><u>Ch.</u> <u>28</u></p>

<p>I examined a splendid grinding stone quary<br/>
on the East side of the road as it leaves the hills and strikes the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Platte]] and<br/>
Brother [[Albert Carrington|Carrington]] found a very excellent coal bed on [[Deer Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Deer Creek]]. The<br/>
specimens produced were good.</p>

<p>At the blowing of the horn at night I did<br/>
not feel much like retiring to bed so I walked half a mile<br/>
from the camp on the bank of Deer Creek and found brother<br/>
[[William Clayton|William Clayton]] fishing with a hook. He had caught two<br/>
dozen good fish they resembled the eastern herring. Another brother<br/>
had also caught some. As they were about to leave they left<br/>
their lines for me to fish with.</p>

<p>So I sat down for half an hour musing<br/>
alone as unconcered as though I had been on the banks of<br/>
[[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington River]] in my native place when suddenly I heard<br/>
a rustling in the bushes near me and for the first time the thought<br/>
flushed across me that I was in a country abounding with the<br/>
grizly Bear wolves and Indians and was liable to an attack at<br/>
any moment from either of them away from my company and<br/>
no weapon to defend myself against even a Badger. I thought it<br/>
wisdom to return to camp and picking up my fishing rods I walked<br/>
leasurely home and retired to rest.</p>

<p>Next day we rode our horses during our<br/>
journey several times into the river to find a fording place but<br/>
could not. Our detached company was reported at the ferry<br/>
ten miles or so above us. Our hunters brought in 13 antelopes<br/>
and the M<strike>s</strike>iss<strike>s</strike>ourian Company killed 3 Buffalo.</p>

<p>I started on the following morning</p>",
42658.0,257,,"<p>to go forward in company with brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|A. P. Rockwood]] who was riding President [Brigham Young|Young's]]<br/>
steed when suddenly he sprang upon my horse but instead of striking him he took<br/>
my knee into his jaw and brused me considerably sinking one tooth to the bone<br/>
through three thickness of clothing and one of them buckskin.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and myself then rode on to the<br/>
Ferrying place and found our detachment ferrying over the Missourian company<br/>
who paid the brethren $1.50 cts for each waggon and load and paid in flour<br/>
at $2.50 cts per <u>cwt</u>. while flour through this country was worth at least<br/>
10 dollars per <u>cwt</u>.</p>

<p>It was very difficult to get over the river. They<br/>
carried the goods over in a boat but drew the waggons over the ropes by<br/>
hand but when the current struck them they would frequently roll over<br/>
several times in the water and they came near drowning their horses. One<br/>
of the men would have been lost had not the brethren picked him up<br/>
with the boat. On the road the [[Missouri|Missouri]] company had a <strike>run away</strike> ^stampede^<br/>
of their teams turning over their waggons brusing women and children and<br/>
smashing their things and one ran into the river and would probably have<br/>
drowned and lost all had not a little boy jumped out beside the off<br/>
ox which frightened him and he ""hawed off"" and ran on to a sand bank<br/>
dragging the others with him. The boy was knocked over into the<br/>
water and hurt but the scene ended without any loss of life.</p>

<p>Our blacksmiths had been to work for the<br/>
Missouri company for which they got flour money &amp;c and our<br/>
hunters had been busily engaged. They had killed 5 fat<br/>
buffalo one old she bear and 3 cubs and shot at 2 grizly bear but<br/>
did not get them. Those killed were black bear. Our hunters<br/>
also brought into camp 8 antelope.</p>

<p>Sunday was a very warm day and the camp<br/>
met for prayer meeting at 9 o'clock and at 10 we had a preaching<br/>
meeting. President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] first addressed the meeting and<br/>
was followed by President Young who remarked upon the great<br/>
difference between us as a camp and the Missourian companies<br/>
who were travelling the same road. He said, ""They curse swear</p>",
42658.0,258,,"<p>rip and tare and are trying to swallow up the earth but though they do not<br/>
wish us to have a place on it the Earth will soon open and swallow them<br/>
up and they will go to the land of forgetfulness while the Saints if<br/>
faithful though they suffer some privations here will ultimately inherit<br/>
the earth and increase in power dominion and glory.""</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|He]] spake much to our edification and was followed<br/>
by Elder [[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]] and afterwards the meeting dismissed and the Twelve<br/>
colonels captains &amp;c of the camp met at President Young's waggon and<br/>
consulted upon the measures to be adopted to get across the river. It<br/>
was finally ag<strike>e</strike>reed to go immediately to the mountains with waggons<br/>
and teams and for every two Tens to get polls and lash two or four<br/>
waggons abreast to keep them from turning over and float them<br/>
across the river with boats and ropes. So a company of horsemen<br/>
started for the mountains and teams to draw the poles.</p>

<p>In the evening the flour meal and bacon<br/>
were distributed through the camp equally which had been earned from<br/>
the Missouri company for ferrying them over. It amounted to 5 1/2 lbs<br/>
of flour 2 lbs of meal and a small piece of bacon for each individual<br/>
in the camp. It looked as much of a miracle to me to see our flour<br/>
and meal bags replenished in the midst of the [[Black Hills, Nebraska Territory|Black Hills]] as it did<br/>
to have the children of Israel fed with manna in the Wilderness. But<br/>
the Lord has been truly with us on our journey and wonderfully preserved<br/>
and blessed us.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning the <strike>two</strike> first two<br/>
Tens were called together to make arrangements for crossing. Some of<br/>
our party did not like the mode proprosed to lash the waggons together<br/>
as the current was so strong so we appointed brother [[Thomas Grover|Grover]] as our<br/>
Captain to direct the rafting and concluded to put our poles into a raft<br/>
<strike>and</strike> carry our goods over in a boat and ford our waggons on the raft.</p>

<p>We commenced at 5 o'clock in the morning and <br/>
in four hours we had landed eleven waggon loads of goods upon the<br/>
North Shore with our little leather boat and during the day we got <br/>
over all the waggons belonging to our Tens being eleven waggons in all</p>",
42658.0,259,,"<p>The rest of the encampment being twelve Tens only got<br/>
over the same number of waggons as ourselves. They floated their waggons by<br/>
tying from two to four together but the waggons turned clean over each other<br/>
bottom side up and back again breaking the bows covers and boxes to pieces<br/>
and lo<strike>a</strike>sing ploughs axes and iron left in the boxes.</p>

<p>Most of our company was in the water from<br/>
morning till night and all was very weary when the work was done.</p>

<p>Just <strike>h</strike>as we had drawn Dr. [[Willard Richards|Richards']] two waggons<br/>
to the shore and loaded his goods into them <strike>when</strike> a storm struck us. I sprang<br/>
into my carriage tied all down tight and laid out my whole strength in<br/>
holding my waggon cover on but the rain wind and hail beat so<br/>
heavily that it was a task and my bed and things were nearly drenched<br/>
It only lasted seven minutes but was severe on our waggons and goods<br/>
and our horses ran two or three miles in the storm. I crossed the<br/>
[[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] went after them tied them up and returned weary but had some<br/>
pleasant dreams at night.</p>

<p>I felt unwell next day from the exposures <br/>
of yesterday and with the teeth ache with which I had suffered much<br/>
on my pioneer journey. It was very windy to day and our companies<br/>
crossed the river very slowly. Another [[Missouri|Missouri]] company had<br/>
come up with us.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] thought it wisdom to leave<br/>
a number of the brethren here <strike>with</strike> ^until^ our companies deigning to follow us<br/>
come up and for them to keep a Ferry for the emigrants on the road<br/>
not of our people who would pay $1.50 cts per waggon in flour at<br/>
$2.00 cts per <u>cwt</u> and cows at $10.</p>

<p>The brethren made two new rafts on the<br/>
third day of our fording the river and got quite a number of our<br/>
Pioneer waggons over. I was still unwell but in company with<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] I went on to some of the Bluffs to view the country<br/>
and shot one antelope. This was the first antelope I ever killed.</p>

<p>We had some heavy squals of wind and rain<br/>
and in the evening many of us went over the river and tied up our horses</p>",
42658.0,260,,"<p>and when one company was returning in the leather boat it half filled and they<br/>
came near<strike>ly</strike> sinking.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning we swam our<br/>
horses over and one mule was nearly drowned by being tangled in a rope but<br/>
the current carried him ashore.</p>

<p>Twenty men the day before went down the<br/>
river to dig out two large canoes to cover over and make a Ferry boat.<br/>
The emigrants were arriving daily at our Fording place and they reported<br/>
one thousand waggons between there and [[Fort Laramie, Nebraska Territory|Laramie]]. This was the<br/>
5 <strike>6</strike>th day spent in ferrying our Pioneer company across the river but now<br/>
we had succeeded in getting all over and once more formed our waggons<br/>
into a circle. Over brethren crossed some of the Missourians also and<br/>
ran their boat all night in ferrying them.</p>

<p>Next day also we were still ferrying the <br/>
Gentiles and another large company arrived. We gathered our cattle at<br/>
10 o'clock and harnessed but did not start as all were not ready to <br/>
we turned out our teams again</p>

<p>In the afternoon we heald a council and<br/>
resolved to leave 9 men to tend the Ferry to ford emigrant compaies<br/>
and also our own brethren who should come after us. The men were<br/>
chosen and we met with them again in the evening. President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
rebuked one who <strike>he</strike>pettioned to stay but whom he wished to continue on<br/>
with us. He also instructed the brethren who were to tarry to keep<br/>
together and divide their means accumulated equally according to their<br/>
labour for each to esteem his brother as himself in no wise to <br/>
retain that which belonged to the traveller to be careful of the lives<br/>
and property of those they ferried to forget not their prayers and to come<br/>
up after us with the next company of Saints.</p>

<p>The brethren to remain at the Ferry were<br/>
[[Thomas Grover|Thomas Grover]], captain; [[John Somers Higbee|John S. Higby]] [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] [[William Empy|William Empy]]<br/>
[[Edmund Ellsworth|Edmund Elsworth]] [[Benjamin F. Stewart|Benjamin F. Stewart]] [[Francis Martin Pomeroy|Francis Pomeroy]] [[James Davenport|James<br/>
Davenport]] and [[Appleton Harmon|Appleton Harmon]]</p>

<p>After 7 days tarry we continued our</p>",
42658.0,261,,"<p>journey travelled during the day 21 1/2 miles and had the most wretched camping ground<br/>
at night we had found on the way. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] thought it might be properly called<br/>
hell-gate.  The country abounded with alkaline and the water was disgustingly<br/>
naucious. Our horses and cattle being thirst<strike>l</strike>y drank some and left it and some<br/>
of the cattle got badly mired in the marshes. Our hunters brought in one<br/>
buffalo 1 deer and 3 antelope.</p>

<p>Early on the Sunday morning we hitched up without<br/>
feed or water and left our encampment of death poison-waters and alkaline<br/>
marshes and drove 3 miles to a good campground and sweet water. This was<br/>
on the [[Willow Springs, unorganized U.S. Territory|Willow Spring]] branch about 3  miles from the head.</p>

<p>We bated 2 hours and took breakfast and<br/>
President Young wished me to go on about 15 miles and look up a camp<br/>
ground for the night. So I went forward and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] with<br/>
me to the head of the Willow Spring. Here he stoped with a doctor<br/>
of a Missourian company who had been attending a sick family to<br/>
wait for our waggons to come up and I rode on alone</p>

<p>After travelling alone several miles brother [[John Brown, b. 1820|John <br/>
Brown]] came up with me and we rode on together over a sandy barren sage<br/>
country to a creek of good water about 10 miles west of the Willow Springs<br/>
We arrived here at half past 1 o'clock, and turned out our horses to bait.</p>

<p>Here we tarried till four o'clock watching for<br/>
our waggons to come in sight but we could see no waggons. At length<br/>
two horsemen were seen approaching and we waved a small flag for<br/>
them to come to us supposing they were of our company but they turned<br/>
out to be two hunters of the Missouri companies carrying in buffalo<br/>
meat to their camp. In the distance they thought we were Indians<br/>
and made off.</p>

<p>I mounted my horse and put after them and<br/>
soon overtook them and made inquiries concerning our company. They<br/>
said they had not seen it but had seen about a dozen waggons<br/>
coming by themselves.</p>

<p>I then concluded that our camp had stoped<br/>
at the Willow Springs and so Captain Smith <strike>one of the hunters and</strike> who was the leader</p>",
42658.0,262,,"<p>of the [[Missouri|Missouri]] ^Co^ invited us to go on and camp with them for the night as they did not<br/>
expect to go more than a few miles further than the [[Willow Springs, unorganized U.S. Territory|Creek]] we were now<br/>
on. We could see five miles on the road back and no waggons<br/>
were in sight and as it was now five o'clock I concluded our company<br/>
would not come on and if they did they would go no farther than<br/>
the Creek.</p>

<p>We accepted Captain Smith's proposal and<br/>
went on with him to spend the night with his camp but instead of<br/>
journying only a mile or so he continued on mile after mile finding<br/>
neither feed nor water excepting salt and alkaline grounds until we struck<br/>
the [[Sweetwater River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Sweet Water]] <strike>river</strike> at [[Independence Rock, Nebraska Territory|Independence Rock]] so noted already in Fremont's<br/>
Journal and by other travellers. This was 12 miles from the Creek<br/>
before spoken of.</p>

<p>The Sweet Waters were sweet indeed both<br/>
to man and beast after travelling th<strike>o</strike>rough so much alkiline country<br/>
and there was good feed around.</p>

<p>After a good supper of bacon buffalo corn<br/>
bread coffee milk &amp;c I laid down in a tent with the Missourians but<br/>
did not rest well. I found there was a great difference between<br/>
these Missouri emigrant companies and our own where there was<br/>
no such thing as cursing swearing quarrelling contending with<br/>
other companies &amp;c allowed or practised.</p>

<p>But to return to our Pioneer company. At<br/>
a late hour they came up to the Creek which we had left 12 miles<br/>
back and grass being poor continued on 4 miles West of the creek<br/>
and camped for the night. Not finding me at the creek nor hearing<br/>
from me at all they felt somewhat alarmed lest I was lost or had got<br/>
into trouble with the Indians. They blew the bugle and watched<br/>
for me till midnight and finally fired the cannon while I was<br/>
camped 10 miles from them not thinking that I was giving them<br/>
any trouble. I travelled this day a distance of thirty miles<br/>
and our Pioneer company 20 miles.</p>",
42658.0,263,,"""><u>June 21 1847</u></time></p>

<p>I arose early this morning took breakfast and in company with<br/>
Brother [[John Brown, b. 1820|Brown]] rode clear round Independance Rock. We examined the many<br/>
names and lists of names of the trappers traders travellers and emigrants nearby<br/>
all in black red and yellow paint on this rock. Some had washed out and<br/>
defaced. The greatest number was put on within a few years but we<br/>
found some of thirty years standing. Nearly all the companies who<br/>
pass put their names on. <strike>this rock</strike></p>

<p>After going around and examining it we<br/>
staked our horses and mounted it. I went forward and gained the<br/>
highest point of the south and of the Rock which contains the names. I<br/>
then went to the North end which is the highest point of Independance<br/>
Rock. Here is an opening or cavern that would contain 30 or 40 persons<br/>
and a rock standing upon the highest peak of about 3 tons weight</p>

<p>Upon this rock at the highest point we climbed<br/>
and offered up our prayers according to the order of the Priesthood praying<br/>
earnestly for the blessing of God to rest on President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and his<br/>
brethren the Twelve and all the Pioneer camp, the whole camp and<br/>
House of Israel in the wilderness our wives children and relatives, the <br/>
Mormon Battelion and the Churches abroad. While offering up our<br/>
prayers the Spirit of the Lord descended upon us.</p>

<p><u>I was the First Latter-day Saint on Independance Rock</u></p>

<p>We had a view of our camp from the Rock and<br/>
expected they would noon there so we mounted our horses and<br/>
concluded to examine the country around. We rode five<br/>
miles to the North East went on to the top of a high bluff and</p>",
42658.0,264,,"<p>saw our camp in motion. We than rode to the foot of the mountain<br/>
and traced the way to the</p>

<p>[[Devil|Devil's Gate]]</p>

<p>through which the [[Sweetwater River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Sweet Water]] runs. Here we spent but a few<br/>
moments and then hurried back to [[Independence Rock, unorganized U.S. Territory|Indipendence Rock]]. As our camp<br/>
had come up before we could get to them and camped half a mile East<br/>
of <strike>the Rock</strike> it.</p>

<p>I met President [[Brigham Young|Young]] going up to Independence<br/>
Rock and <strike>I</strike> related to him my travels since I left the company. He<br/>
asked me to go back with him so I turned out my horse having rode<br/>
him twenty miles during the forenoon and returned with President Young<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and others. We spent half<br/>
an hour on the Rock and then returned to our camp mounted our horses<br/>
and rode to the Devil's Gate, five miles from Indipendence<br/>
Rock</p>

<p>We rode as far as we could into the Gate<br/>
hitched our horses and walked into about the centre of the cavern</p>

<p>The Devils Gate is 400 feet high, perpendicular<br/>
rocks, 120 feet wide and 50 rods long and the water rushes through<br/>
it with a roar. The rocks are course grey granite with a vein of<br/>
black trap rock running through. We spent about half an hour here<br/>
and then had to back our horses out and rode around it on the<br/>
South Side. Some of the footmen walked over the top of it. We<br/>
camped for the night about one mile west of the Devil's Gate on the<br/>
bank of the Sweet Water.</p>

<p>A Guide Board was put up at Devils Gate<br/>
stating that it was 175 1/4 miles from [[Fort Laramie, Nebraska Territory|Fort Laramie]] and 50 1/4 from<br/>
our Ferry of the [[Platte River, Nebraska Territory|Platte River]].</p>

<p>Two more Missourian companies overtook<br/>
us at noon on our next day's travel and they informed us that a<br/>
man was drowned at the Ferry after we left in trying to swim his</p>",

<p>On the evening of the 26 after a travel of 18 3/4 miles we camped<br/>
opposite the table rock and near the summit of the South Pass. I<br/>
was quite astonished at the road and country to day considering we<br/>
were crossing the South Pass of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]] it was the best<br/>
road we had travelled over for many days and had it not been for<br/>
the <strike>wide river</strike> ^[[Wind River Range, unorganized U.S. Territory|Wind River]]^ range of mountains in full view of our right covered with<br/>
eternal snow and some snow banks 10 feet deep by the side of the<br/>
road as we passed along with the table rock on the left I should almost<br/>
have thought myself travelling over the beautiful prairies of [[Illinois|Illinois]] and<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] excepting that the country was covered with more sage than<br/>
prairie grass. The road for many miles and also the plain<br/>
of beautiful grass lying North of the table rock were strewn with<br/>
very handsome cornelian stones. I saw more in one hour this evening<br/>
than ever before during my whole ^life <strike>travels</strike>^ either in the rude state or polished<br/>
<strike>and set in breast pins &amp;c</strike> in all the jewellers shops I ever saw in my<br/>
travels</p>

<p>Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]], [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]], [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]] &amp; [[John Brown, b. 1820|Brown]]<br/>
had gone to take observations on the dividing ridge and they</p>",
42658.0,266,,""">June the 27 1847</time> was the day 3 years from<br/>
the martyrdom of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]]</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning but we harnessed<br/>
up our teams and drove to where brothers [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] had camped<br/>
with Major Harris who had been travelling through [[Oregon|Oregon]] and [[California|California]]<br/>
for 25 years and had much acquaintance with the Country. He brought<br/>
a file of Oregon papers and one published by [[Samuel S. Brannan|S. Brannon]] of<br/>
California. We had much conversation with him and<br/>
he spoke unfavourably of the [[Salt Lake Valley, Utah|Salt Lake Country]] for a settlement.<br/>
but spoke of other places not far off that were good</p>

<p>Meeting with Mr. [[Mr. Bridger|Bridger]]</p>

<p>We parted with Major Harris next day after doing some<br/>
trading with him and in our afternoon's travel met Mr Bridger of<br/>
the fort on the way with two men going to [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Laramie]]. He<br/>
was expecting us and wished to have an interview with President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
and the Twelve and we also wished to have an interview with him <br/>
so we immediately returned to the Creek upon which we had<br/>
nooned and camped for the night and Mr. Bridger and his men<br/>
camped with us.</p>

<p>We met in council with Mr Bridger and<br/>
spent some hours in conversation and found him to have been a great<br/>
traveller and <strike>had</strike> ^professed^ an extensive knowledge of nearly all Oregon and<br/>
California—the mountains lakes rivers springs valleys mines ore &amp;c<br/>
He spoke more highly of the [[Utah Territory|Great Basin]] for a settlement than</p>",
42658.0,267,,"<p>Major Harris had done said that it was his paradise and that if this people<br/>
settled in it he wanted to settle with them. He said that there was but one thing<br/>
that could operate against its becoming a great grain country and that would<br/>
be frost for he did not know but the frost might affect the corn. He conversed<br/>
with us about a great variety of subjects connected with the country said he was<br/>
ashamed of the maps of [[John Charles Fremont|Fremont]] and that he knew nothing about the country only<br/>
the plain travelled road and that he could correct all the maps published<br/>
of the Western world.</p>

<p>We parted next day from Mr. [[Mr. Bridger|Bridger]] who <br/>
remarked that it would not be prudent to bring a great population<br/>
to the [[Utah Territory|Bason]] until we ascertained whether grain would grow or<br/>
not. [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|O. P. Rockwell]] and myself went forward to pick out<br/>
a camp ground. It was fifteen miles from where we nooned before<br/>
we could get grass and this made the longest day's journey we had<br/>
travelled on the whole route making 23 3/4 miles.</p>

<p>We travelled 8 miles on the last day of June<br/>
and camped on the bank of the [[Green River, Sweetwater County, Wyoming Territory|Green River]] at the Ferry and the afternoon<br/>
was spent in building a raft as the river was high and could only be crossed<br/>
upon rafts or boats.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the arrival of Elder [[Samuel S. Brannan|Samuel S. Brannan]] from the [[Bay of San Francisco, Mexican Cession Territory|bay of San Francisco]] was anounced in camp<br/>
and we were glad to meet with him to hear from the Saints who went<br/>
with him. He gave us an account of their landing their travels<br/>
and present settlement which was two hundred miles up the river from<br/>
the bay and they were putting in wheat and building up their place.</p>

<p>During the <strike>two</strike> three following days we were<br/>
fording Green River. On the afternoon of the second the Twelve<br/>
held a council and four men were appointed to return and meet the<br/>
Camp of Israel and pi<strike>o</strike>l<strike>i</strike>ot them up. We each wrote our voices concerning<br/>
the counsel to be given to the camp. I wrote a letter next day<br/>
to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] and [[John Benbow|John Benbow]] to be taken back by the<br/>
pilots. The ferrying was finished on the evening of<br/>
the third day and we moved on three miles and camped.</p>",
42658.0,268,,""">5</time>th drove 20 miles and camped on [[Blacks Fork, Utah Territory|Black's <br/>
Fork]] There was neither feed nor water between this place and Green River but simileer to the last 200 miles a sandy desert<br/>
covered with sagebrush.</p>

<p>Next evening we camped on the west<br/>
side of [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] which we crossed on the following day and<br/>
drove to Fort Bridger. In the region of the fort before we got<br/>
on to our camping ground we crossed more than a dozzen trout<br/>
brooks the water running swiftly but clear with hard cold gravelly<br/>
buttons and the whole region of country up and down these.</p>",
42658.0,269,,"<p>streams was covered with grass a knee deep.</p>

<p>The brethren caught several brook trout which was<br/>
the first I had seen since I left [[England|England]] and as we were to spend the next day at<br/>
the [[Fort Bridger, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort]] I calculated upon a day of fishing. So as soon as I had my breakfast<br/>
next morning I rigged up my trout rod that I had brought with me from [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]<br/>
fixed my reel line and artificial fly and went to one of the brooks close by<br/>
to try my luck.</p>

<p>The men at the Fort said that there were but<br/>
very few trout in the streams and a good many of the brethren were already<br/>
at the creeks with their rods trying their skill baiting with fresh meat<br/>
and grasshoppers but no one was catching any.</p>

<p>I went and threw my fly into the water and<br/>
it being the first time that I ever tried the artificial fly in America<br/>
or ever saw it tried I watched it as it floated upon the water<br/>
with as much interest as [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] did his kite string so was I highly<br/>
gratified when I saw the nimble trout dart at my fly hook himself<br/>
and run away with the line but I soon worried him out and<br/>
drew him to shore.</p>

<p>I fished two or three hours during the<br/>
morning and evening and caught twelve in all. One half of them<br/>
would weigh 3/4 lbs each while all the rest of the camp did not<br/>
catch 3 lbs in all which was proof positive that the artificial fly is<br/>
far the best to fish with.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went to Bridger's<br/>
house and traded off my flint lock riffle for four buffalo <strike>e</strike>calves<br/>
which were large nice and well dressed. At this fort I found<br/>
things generally at least one thir[ink blot] higher than I had ever met at<br/>
any <strike>any</strike>other trading post I ever saw in Amer<strike>d</strike>ica.</p>

<p>I arose in the morning quite unwell<br/>
and felt threatened with the <strike>camp</strike> Mountain fever yet I mounted my<br/>
horse and rode till ten o'clock but before I started I was called.</p>",
42658.0,270,,""">10</time>th 1 1/2 miles from [[Bear River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bear River]] by the best stream of water<br/>
we had found on the route and a small stream near by <strike>and</strike><br/>
We had travelled this day up and down steep hills and passed through<br/>
a valley six miles long grass knee deep strong mineral springs<br/>
copper lead coal and lime.</p>

<p>Camp fires were discovered about 3<br/>
miles from our camping ground and [[George Albert Smith|Georg A Smith]] and<br/>
others went over to them and found it to be a Mr. [[Miles Goodyear|Miles<br/>
Goo<strike>y</strike>dyier]]. He had settled at [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Salt Lake]] and had a garden and<br/>
vegitation he said doing well. Several Missourians were with<br/>
with him going to the States.</p>

<p>The subject was brought up concerning<br/>
the emigrant company who perished in the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] last Winter.<br/>
They were mostly from [[Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Indipendence]] and [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]] counties Missouri<br/>
and were a mob company that threatened to drive out the<br/>
Mormons who were in [[California|California]] and started with that spirit<br/>
in their hearts. But it seemed as though they were<br/>
ripe for judgement. The snows fell upon them 18 feet<br/>

40 persons perished and were mostly eaten up by those who<br/>
survived them. Mrs [[Levinah W. Jackson Murphy|L. Murphy]] of [[Tennessee|Tenn]]. whom I</p>",

<p>We spent the Sunday in camp but some of the<br/>
brethren rode out to seek out the road and found a tar spring about 15<br/>
miles South of our camp.</p>

<p>Early on the Monday morning I rode to [[Bear River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bear<br/>
River]] and for the first time I saw the long looked for</p>

<p>[[Bear River Valley, United States|Bear River Valley]]</p>

<p>The spot where we struck it was not very interesting. There was<br/>
considerable grass in the valley and some timber and thick brushes<br/>
on the bank of the river. My object in riding to the river before<br/>
the camp was to try my luck in fishing for trout. After<br/>
fishing for several hours I started after the camp having<br/>
caught 8 trout in all.</p>

<p>The camp had travelled 9 miles and <br/>
nooned in a valley. I found President [[Brigham Young|Young]] very sick with<br/>
the fever. The company had started on but President Young<br/>
being so sick concluded not to move from where he was. Brothers<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] and others staid with him with<br/>
their waggons</p>

<p>We drove without any road over hills<br/>
and dales having to make our road as we went along. We camped<br/>
at night <strike>l in Mathews Valley</strike> by the side of Reddings Cave. The valleys<br/>
were beginning to grow more fertile and the air more pacific.</p>

<p>I arose quite unwell in the morning. Several brethren<br/>
went to meet President Young, and the camp laid still waiting for him to<br/>
come up. Brother Kimball came at noon and a council of the whole<br/>
was called and it was resolved that [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] take a company of ^about^ 20<br/>
waggons and 40 men and go on to the Kanyon and make a road as</p>",
42658.0,272,,"<p>they went <strike>along</strike> <strike>and if they could not go through Kanyon to find Smith's cutoff<br/>
and make a road over the mountain</strike> so that we need not be hindered when we<br/>
came along. There were 23 waggons in all that started at 1'oclock.</p>

<p>We had found but little game for many days<br/>
until yesterday when the Hunters brought in 12 antelope and 10 to day.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] was better to day but designed not<br/>
to move until to morrow. In the afternoon I <strike>walked</strike>rode out with Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
in search of springs of water.</p>

<p>Next <strike>In the</strike> morning I rode back 7 miles to visit<br/>
President Young and found him much better in health and quite cheerful<br/>
The evening before Dr Richards myself and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] went before<br/>
the Lord to pray for brother Young and we had a testimony that he<br/>
would recover<strike>ed</strike> from that hour. I found brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] the sickest<br/>
man that had been in our company. I tarried until near night assisting<br/>
the <strike>camp</strike> ^sick^ and then returned back to our encampment.</p>

<p>I started early in the morrow with my<br/>
carriage and horses to go back for President Young and brother Rockwood<br/>
I was two hours driving 7 miles to their camp. I found them much<br/>
better and they thought they could ride as my carriage was the easiest<br/>
vehicle in our company. I made up a bed and took them both into<br/>
my carriage and the rest of the waggons started and drove to the main<br/>
body and the sick seemed refreshed with their ride. After a short halt<br/>
the whole company drove 4 1/2 miles and camped for the night</p>

<p>Next day I again took Brothers Young<br/>
and Rockwood in my carriage and drove them during the day. We<br/>
had bad road for the sick and brother Brigham was wearied out and <br/>
worse at night. I went to [[Weber River, Utah Territory|Weber's Fork]] 1 mile from our encampment<br/>
at night and caught a trout for him.</p>

<p>He was still sick in the morning and after<br/>
we had driven three miles on to Weber's Fork we camped the remainder<br/>
of the day in consequence of President Young being worse. The Twelve<br/>
and others went out and prayed for him and the sick according to<br/>
the order of the Priesthood.</p>",

it kept each teamster very busy to do<strike>g</strike>dge the stumps and not break<br/>

the tops all to pieces. There were two children in the waggon but<br/>

came in full view of the Valley of the Great Salt Lake or the Great<br/>

<p>We gazed with wonder and admiration<br/>
upon the vast fertile Valley spread out before us for about 25 miles<br/>
and 16 in wedth clothed with a heavy garment of vegitation and in the<br/>
midst of which glistened the waters of the Great Salt Lake with<br/>
mountains all around lowering to the skys and streams riv<strike>ll</strike>ulets<br/>

a perfect chain of everlasting mountains covered with eternal snow with their<br/>
innumerable peaks like pyramids towering towards heaven presented at one<br/>
view to us the grandest scenery and prospect that we could have obtained on<br/>
earth. Thoughts of pleasant meditations ran in rapid succession<br/>
through our minds at the anticipation that not many years hence the<br/>
House of God would be established in the mountains and exalted above<br/>
the hills while the valleys would be converted into orchards vineyards<br/>
and fields &amp; planted with cities and the standard of Zion be unfurled for<br/>
the nations to gather.</p>

<p>Ch. 29</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] expressed his full satisfaction<br/>
in the appearence of the Valley as a resting place for the Saints and was<br/>
amply repaid for his journey ^and while tarying upon his bed in my carriage gazing upon the scene before him many things of the future concerning the valley was shown to him in vision.^</p>

<p>After gazing awhile upon the scenery before<br/>
us we travelled across the table land 4 miles into the Valley to the<br/>
encampment of our brethren who had arrived two days before us. They<br/>
had pitched upon the bank of two small streams of pure water and had<br/>
commenced plowing and broken about 5 acres of ground. They had also<br/>
began planting potatoes; and as soon as we were formed into the <br/>
encampment before I took my dinner having 1/2 bushel of potatoes<br/>
I went to the plowed field and planted them hoping with the blessing<br/>
of God to save at least the seed for another year. The brethren<br/>
had damed up one of the Creeks and dug a trench and by night nearly<br/>
the whole ground which was found very dry was irrigated.</p>

<p>Towards evening brothers [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[George Albert Smith|Smith]]<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] and myself rode several miles up the creek into the mountains<br/>

<p>This was the first Sunday the Church of Jesus Christ of<br/>
Latter-day Saints spent in the Great Salt Lake Valley. We<br/>
shaved and cleaned up and met in the circle of the encampment<br/>
Meeting was opened by the Bishops and</p>

<p><u>[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] Preached the First Sermon</u></p>

<p>It was an interesting discourse. [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]]<br/>
followed.</p>

<p>After an intermission of two hours the Church <br/>
met again at 2 o'clock and the Bishops broke bread to the<br/>
congregation. I then addressed the brethren and was followed by <br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]. Several other brethren also expressed<br/>
their feelings and all expressed the universal satisfaction with the Valley<br/>
and were joyfully disappointed at the whole prospect.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting President [[Brigham Young|Young]] <br/>
though feeble addressed the congregation for a few moments. He<br/>
informed the brethren that they must not work on Sunday; that<br/>
they would loose five times as much as they would gain by it.<br/>
None were to hunt or fish on that day and there should not any man<br/>
dwell among us who would not observe these rules. They might go<br/>
and dwell where they pleased but should not dwell with us. He<br/>
said that no man should buy any land who came here that he had<br/>
none to sell neither should he buy any but every man should<br/>
have his land measured out to him for city and farming purposes<br/>
He might till it as he pleased but he must be industrious and<br/>
take care of it.</p>",
42658.0,277,,"<p>On the Monday the camp in general was busily engaged<br/>
in ploughing and planting corn and other seeds. Ten men were chosen for an</p>

<p><u>Exploring Expedition through the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]]</u></p>

<p>I took President [[Brigham Young|Young]] into my carriage and travelled two miles towards the<br/>
mountain and made choice of a spot of ground for our garden with a small<br/>
rivlet running through it which I named garden Creek.</p>

<p>We then returned to camp and went North about<br/>
five miles and we all went to the top of a high peak on the edge of<br/>
the mountain which we considered a good place to raise an ensign. To<br/>
we named it <u>[[Ensign Peak, Utah Territory|Ensign Peak]]</u></p>

<p>I was the first person who ascended this hill<br/>
which we had thus named. Brother Young was very weary in climbing<br/>
being feeble from his recent fever.</p>

<p>We descended to the Valley and started North to<br/>
visit the hot sulpher springs but we returned two miles to get a drink<br/>
of cold water and then went back 4 miles to the Springs, and then<br/>
returned to the camp quite weary. Brothers [[Joseph Matthews|Mathews]] and [[John Brown|Brown]]<br/>
had crossed the Valley in the narrowest place opposite the camp to<br/>
the West mountain and found it ^about^ 15 miles</p>

<p>Next morning brother [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] came<br/>
into camp and informed us that [[John Brown|Brown's]] detatchment of the Mormon<br/>
Battalion would be with us in about two days.</p>

<p>We again started on our exploring expedition<br/>
Brother Lyman and all of the members of the Quorum of the Twelve<br/>
in camp being 8 in number were of the company. Six others of the<br/>
brethren were with us among whom was [[Samuel S. Brannan|Brannon]] from [[San Francisco Bay, California|San Francisco]].</p>

<p><u>Visit to the [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Salt Lake]]</u></p>

<p>We started for the purpose of visiting the Salt Lake and mountain<br/>
on the west of the Valley. We travelled two miles west from</p>",
42658.0,278,,"<p>[[Temple Square, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple Block]] and came to the [[Jordan River, Utah Territory|Utah outlet]] of the [[Utah Lake, Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah Lake]] thence 14 miles<br/>
to the West Mountain and found that the land was not near so fertile on the<br/>
west side of the Valley as on the East and but little fresh water as far<br/>
as we went while the East side of the Valley was <strike>as</strike> well watered. <strike>as any<br/>
land I ever saw.</strike></p>

<p>We took our dinner at the fresh water pool<br/>
and then rode 6 miles to a large rock on the shore of the [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Salt Lake]] where<br/>
we made a halt and we all went into the Salt water. It was quite <br/>
warm and inpregnated with as much salt as could possibly be dissolved<br/>
in water. No person could sink in it but would float and roll<br/>
on the top like a dry log. While standing to our waist in water<br/>
we could not get our knees to the bottom but would rise to the top like<br/>
cork. The whole body of the water would make at least 3 pints<br/>
of the best white salt to one gallon of water. There was a lot of<br/>
beautiful white salt on the shore. We concluded that the Salt<br/>
Lake was one of the wonders of the world. After spending<br/>
an hour here we rode south on the Lake shore about 4 miles<br/>
and then returned 10 miles to our place of nooning. The whole<br/>
distance of the day was 40 miles.</p>

<p>We arose refreshed by sleep in the open<br/>
and having lost my carriage whip the night before I started<br/>
in the morning on horseback to go after it.</p>

<p>As I got near the place where it was droped<br/>
two objects appeared before me about half mile distant whom I took<br/>
at first for bears but after approaching a little nearer I discovered <br/>
about 20 Indians and as I was unharmed I did not consider it<br/>
prudent to go among them so I wheeled about my horse and started<br/>
on my return at a slow trot.</p>

<p>As soon as I started back they called<br/>
to me and one mounted his horse and came after me with all speed<br/>
When he got within 20 rods of me I stoped and met him and the <br/>
rest followed on. I found them to be Utes and that they<br/>
wanted to trade. I informed him by signs that our camp</p>",

<p>After our return to the camp President [[Brigham Young|Young]] called <br/>
a council of the Quorum of the Twelve. There were present<br/>
Brigham Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]<br/>
Wilford Woodruf [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] and [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T.<br/>

<p>We walked from the North camp to about<br/>
the centre between the two creeks when President Young waved<br/>
his hands and said here is the 40 acres for the Temple and the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]]<br/>
can be laid out perfectly square North and South East and West. We<br/>
had conversed upon the subject of the location for the Temple previous to this.</p>

<p>It was then moved and carried that the Temple<br/>
Lot contain 40 acres on the ground where we stood. It was also moved<br/>
and carried that the city be laid out into lots of 10 rods by 20 each exclusive<br/>
of the streets and into blocks of 8 lots each being 10 acres in each block and<br/>
one and a quarter in each lot.</p>

<p>It was further moved and carried that each street<br/>
be laid out 8 rods wide and that there be a side walk on each side 20 feet<br/>
wide and that each house be built in the centre of the lot 20 feet from the<br/>
front line that there night be a uniformity throughout the city.</p>",
42658.0,280,,"<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] remarked that he wished but one house<br/>
be built upon a lot and they being in the centre if they took fire they <strike>would</strike> not<br/>
burn up their neighbours and if any man wanted a market to have it upon<br/>
his own lot and not to lay out public grounds for a market place. Let every man<br/>
cultivate his own lot and set out every kind of fruit trees and shade trees and beautify<br/>
the city.</p>

<p>It was moved and carried that there be four<br/>
Public Squares of 10 acres each to be laid out in various parts of the City for<br/>
Public Grounds. This was in Lot 40° 45 44.</p>

<p>At 8 o'clock the whole camp came together on the<br/>
same ground and passed all of the above votes unanimously as they are recorded and<br/>
when the business part of the meeting was closed President Young arosed and <br/>
addressed the assembly upon a varity of subjects.</p>

<p>In his remarks President Young remarked that he <br/>
was determined to have all things in order and righteousness should be practised<br/>
in the land. We had come here according to the direction and counsel<br/>
of brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] before his death and that he would still have been<br/>
alive if the Twelve had been in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] when he re-crossed the river from<br/>
[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] to Nauvoo.</p>

<p>He spoke of the Saints being driven from place<br/>
to place and said the only way [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]] [[John Bullock Clark|Clark]] [[Samuel D. Lucas|Lucas]] [[Thomas Benton|Benton]] and all the leaders<br/>
of the mob could be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus would have been to have come forward voluntarily and let their heads be cut off and <strike>let</strike> their<br/>
blood run upon the ground and go up as a smoking in<strike>s</strike>cense before the<br/>
Heavens as an atonement but now they will be eternally damned.</p>

<p>All the Presidents and Governors of the United<br/>
States had rejected all our petitions from first to last. When the Saints<br/>
were driven from [[Illinois|Illinois]] to perish on the prairies then President [[James Knox Polk|Polk]]<br/>
sends for a draft of 500 men to go into the army. What for? That<br/>
they might be w<strike>or</strike>asted away and their wives and children he wasted<br/>
away that we might be entirely wasted away as a people. If the<br/>
brethren had not gone they would have made war upon us and the<br/>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] with his brethren the Twelve and others<br/>
mounted our horses and started to meet the Battalion under the command<br/>
of Captain [[John Brown|Brown]].</p>

<p>Some of them were met about 4 miles from camp<br/>
and we continued on and soon met with Capts Brown [[Nelson Higgins|Higgins]] Liut. [[William Wesley Willis|Willis]] and<br/>
the train following them and I met brother [[James Bevin|Bevin]] who went from my family<br/>
into the army. There were about 140 of the Battalion and a company<br/>
of about 100 of the [[Mississippi|Mississippie]] Saints that came with them from [[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Pueblo]]<br/>
being about 60 waggons in all 100 horses &amp; mules and 300 head of cattle which<br/>
added greatly to our numbers.</p>

<p>We had a heavy shower of rain while we were<br/>
in the Kanyon which sent the water in the creeks from the mountains<br/>
with a rush and roar like thunder resembling the opening of a flood gate<br/>
The first rush of water came down with a front 3 feet high. The shower<br/>
spread over a good share of the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] where we were settled.</p>

<p>We returned at the head of the companies and<br/>
marched into camp with music and they took up their quarters between<br/>
our two camps on the bank of the creek.</p>

<p>While we had been exploring the rest of the<br/>
Pioneers had been farming putting in potatoes corn beans peas buckwheat<br/>
and preparing a garden for garden seeds. Today our garden was</p>",

<p>In the evening Brother [[Brigham Young|Young]] and the Twelve went to <br/>
the Warm Springs and bathed</p>

<p>Next day we met in Council — the Twelve<br/>
Capts  [[John Brown|Brown]] [[Nelson Higgins|Higgins]] [[William Wesley Willis|Willis]] and others and heard the statement of the officers<br/>
concerning the Battalion and their situation and counsel was given by<br/>
President Young what course to persue</p>

<p>It was deemed wisdom for Capt Brown <br/>
and others to go to the [[Bay of San Francisco, Mexican Cession Territory|Bay of San Francisco]] and report himself<br/>
men and the State and brother [[Samuel S. Brannan|Brannan]] was to go as their pilot</p>

<p>After the Council broke up we mounted<br/>
our horses and rode to the Warm Springs and visited the Hot Sulpher<br/>
Spring and on our return I visited the Battalion and then the planting<br/>
ground and found some of our potatoes had rotted and some were coming<br/>
up. Our corn was also up and our beans.</p>

<p>At 8 o'clock <strike>o</strike>in the evening all the<br/>
camp met together and was addressed for more than an hour by<br/>
President Young. He expressed his feelings freely concerning<br/>
the treatment of the Government towards us as on the 28th.</p>

<p>The meeting opened by the assembly with<br/>
a shout of Hosannah to God and the Lamb repeated three times<br/>
with its Amen. Brother Young said the Ancient of Days<br/>
was not as far off as many supposed.</p>

<p>On the Saturday the Battalion went to <br/>
work at the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and our Camp of Pioneers sowing and planting.</p>

<p>At <strike>About</strike> noon a company of about 20 Utahs<br/>
visited our camp. They came to trade with us and while doing<br/>
so one Indian struck another over the head with his gun and broke<br/>
it and the old chief whipped them both. In the afternoon<br/>
the one who had the gun broke over his head stole the others horse<br/>
and made off with him. The Indians followed and shot both<br/>
him and his horse dead and they returned to our camp an The<br/>

at 10 o'clock and the meeting was opened by singing and prayer. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
first addressed the <strike>me</strike>congregation and then was followed by a discourse from [[Orson Pratt|Orson<br/>

the building up of Zion.</p>

<p>When Elder Pratt concluded [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] read a <br/>
letter from the commanding officer of the Battalion who went with it to the<br/>
Pacific and he spoke in the highest terms of praise of the members of the<br/>
Battalion in all their proceedings. A letter was also read from Capt [[Jefferson Hunt|Hunt]]; and<br/>
then Brother Kimball made some remarks upon our relations with the Indians.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the revelation given at [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter<br/>
Quarters]] was read by Elder Willard Richards and received a unanimous vote and <br/>
then the congregation was addressed by Elder [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]. A vote<br/>
was taken to cease entirely trading with the Indians, and it was decided<br/>
to form all the encampments into one.</p>

<p>On the Monday Brother Benson started<br/>
and we commenced laying out the city beginning with the Temple Block<br/>
In forming the Temple Block 40 acres appeared so large that we held a council<br/>
to determine if it would or not be wisdom to reduce it to one half. [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]]<br/>

<p>""I am going to day to speak upon the subject of the Patriarchal<br/>
Priesthood and by request of brother Crow say something upon the death of</p>",
42658.0,288,,"<p>[[Robert Crow|his]] [[Milton Howard Threkeld|[grand]child]] <strike>by drowning</strike> the other day. [[Brigham Young|I]] hope to speak so as to be understood.</p>

<p>There is a reality in eternal things as much as in<br/>
the things of time which we daily see with our eyes. When a man has<br/>
a dream or vision of eternal things it is an evidence of its truth as much as though<br/>
he saw it with his own eyes in one sense of the word.</p>

<p>The Lord has hid from man the things that<br/>
he knew before he came into the flesh that he might walk by faith<br/>
and prove himself while here. The Lord converses with man on the earth<br/>
in the form of a servant and by visions and dreams &amp;c but he never appeared<br/>
to man in the flesh in the fulness of his glory for He is as a consuming<br/>
fire and a mortal body would p<strike>a</strike>erish in an instant in His presence.</p>

<p>The Priesthood is again restored to the earth<br/>
to bring that which was lost. We do not receive all at once but we<br/>
receive grace for grace. When brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] received the Priesthood<br/>
he did not receive all at once. He was a Prophet Seer and Revelator<br/>
before he had the fulness of the Priesthood and keys of the Kingdom. He<br/>
first received the Aaronic Priesthood and keys from under the hands<br/>
of [[John (NT)|John]] the Baptist. He then had not power to lay on hands to confirm<br/>
the Church but afterwards he received the Patriarchal or [[Melchizedek (OT)|Melchisidick]] Priesthood<br/>
from under the hands of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] [[James (NT)|James]] and [[John (NT)|John]] who were of the Twelve<br/>
Apostles and were the Presidency when the other Apostles were absent.</p>

<p>From those Apostles Joseph Smith received<br/>
every power blessing and privilege of the highest authority of the Melchisidick<br/>
Priesthood ever committed to man on the earth.</p>

<p>Some have had fears that we had not power<br/>
to get revelations since the death of Joseph. But I want this subject from this<br/>
time and forever to be set at rest; and I want the Church to understand from<br/>
this day henceforth and forever that an Apostle is the highest office and<br/>
authority that there is in the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth.</p>

<p>From whom did Joseph receive his authority?<br/>
From just such men as set around me here -[<u>pointing to the Twelve Apostles<br/>
who sat with him</u>]- Peter James and John were Apostles and there <br/>
was no noise about their being Seers and Revelators though those</p>",
42658.0,289,,"<p>gifts were among them. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] gave unto me and my brethren the Twelve<br/>
all the Priesthood Keys power and authority which he held and those are powers which <br/>
belong to the Apostleship.</p>

<p>In Joseph's day we had to ordain Patriarchs. Could<br/>
we ordain men to authority greater than we held ourselves? No. But it is necessary<br/>
to have Patriarchs to bless the people that they may have blessings by the Spirit of<br/>
prophecy and revelation sealed upon their heads and their posterity and to know what awaits<br/>
their posterity.</p>

<p>Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Smith]] was the senior Patriarch in the<br/>
Church and first Patriarch in our day and afterwards [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] was the senior<br/>
Patriarch for his father sealed it upon his head. But w<strike>as</strike>ere the<strike>re</strike>ir power and authority<br/>
different from that of all Patriarchs in the Church? No. There were all alike in their<br/>
authority in blessing.</p>

<p>[[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] is spoken of in the Bible that he should come<br/>
in the last days to turn the Hearts of the fathers to the children and the children<br/>
to their fathers. The fulfilment of this Scripture is manifest in establishing<br/>
the Kingdom of God and Priesthood on the earth in the last days and those who<br/>
hold the keys of the Priesthood and sealing power have the Spirit and Power of<br/>
Elijah and it is necessary in order to redeem our dead and save our children.</p>

<p>There is much more importance attached to this<br/>
than parents are aware of.</p>

<p>In the loss of this [[Milton Howard Threkeld|[grand]child]] of Brother [[Robert Crow|Crow]] that was<br/>
drowned I felt that I could weep in sorrow if I gave way to my feelings; for<br/>
I realize it is a loss to the parents to loose little children. It is true all<br/>
children are saved. Their names are written in the Lamb's book of life<br/>
which was the case with every Spirit that takes a tabernacle on this earth<br/>
Their names were written there before the world was made and will there<br/>
ever remain until they sin against the Holy Ghost. It will then be<br/>
blotted out no more to be re<strike>at</strike>corded for ever.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this can Brother Crow get<br/>
that child again or any other persons their children except there is something done<br/>
for them on the earth by their parents? No they would not. They <strike>they</strike><br/>
would go to God who gave them but the parents ^on earth^ would not have them</p>",
42658.0,290,,"<p>The parents framed the body to be sure but the Lord gave the Spirit and what is the<br/>
body good for without the spirit? What then can be done? I will tell you<br/>
A man that has embraced the Gospel must go to some one who has the Priesthood<br/>
and keys and power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] and must attend to ordinances for that child even<br/>
must be baptized for it as well as to have it sealed to him and through this medium<br/>
claim his child in the morning of the resurrection and the Lord will give it up<br/>
to him.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] had my children sealed to me in the Temple<br/>
except one that died and that I shall leave in the hands of the Lord until I have<br/>
another opportunity.</p>

<p>As soon as we get up some adobie houses for our families we shall go to work to build another [[Salt Lake City Temple, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]] and as soon as a [[Endowment House, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|place]] is<br/>
prepared we shall commence the endowments long before the Temple is built<br/>
and we shall take time and each step the Saints take let them take<br/>
time enough about it to understand it.</p>

<p>Everything at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] went with a rush<br/>
We had to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] with the trowel in one hand and the sword in the<br/>
other and mobs were upon us all the while and many crying out, ""O the<br/>
Temple cant be built!"" I told them it should be built. This Church<br/>
should not fall and the Lord said if we did not build it we should be<br/>
rejected as a Church with our dead. Why did He say it? Because<br/>
the Saints were becoming slothful and covetous and would spend their money<br/>
upon fine houses for themselves before they would put it into a house for<br/>
the Lord.  But we went at it and finished it and turned it over<br/>
into the hands of the Lord in spite of earth and hell and the brethren was <br/>
so faithful at it that we laboured day and night to give them their endowment.</p>

<p>The children want to be sealed to their parents and<br/>
parents to their children that they may have blessings in eternity which they<br/>
will stand in  need of.</p>

<p>God promised to [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] that his seed should be<br/>
as numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea shore and to<br/>
his seed there should be no end. This of course would continue to all<br/>
eternity the same blessings upon our heads if we are faithful for</p>",

<p>In the afternoon the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
convened together and we had one of the most interesting councils we ever heed [had]<br/>
together. At the commencement two of the quorum was<br/>
sharply reproved for undoing what the majority of the quorum had done</p>",
42658.0,293,,"<p>in the organization of the camps for travelling. At first it was not received but afterwards<br/>
the error was seen and confessed. Much teaching was given by President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
and the power of God rested upon us and our hearts were melted.</p>

<p>The President said if he did not tell us of our faults<br/>
we should be destroyed but if he told us of them and reproved us we should live in<br/>
love in love and our hearts be cemented together.</p>

<p>Brothers [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] had been to [[England|England]]<br/>
and done a good work but had returned to [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] and disorganized<br/>
the two divisions and companies that the quorum of the Twelve had spent the<br/>
whole Winter in organizing and which was also governed by revelation. Brother<br/>
Parley took the lead; and President Young chastized him for his course and<br/>
taught us principle. He said that when we set apart one or more of the<br/>
Twelve to go and do a certain piece of work they would be blessed in doing<br/>
that and the quorum would back up what they did, but when one or more<br/>
of the quorum interfere with the work of the majority they burn their fingers<br/>
and do wrong. When the majority of the Twelve plant a Stake of <br/>
Zion and establish a President over the Stake and appoint a High Council<br/>
has the minority of the Twelve one or more any right to go and interfere<br/>
with those councils? No; unless they should get corrupt and do wrong.<br/>
Then it would be the duty of any one of the Twelve to show them their error<br/>
and teach them what was right: and should the majority of those Councils<br/>
get corrupt and try to lead astray the people it would then be the duty<br/>
of any one of the Twelve to disannul those councils and call upon the<br/>
people to sustain him and appoint a new one; but while the councils<br/>
are trying to do right it would be the duty of the Twelve who might be<br/>
with them to assist in carrying out the views that the majority of the<br/>
Twelve had established.</p>

<p>The quorum all decided that Brother Parley Pratt<br/>
had committed an error in not carrying out the <strike>emigration</strike> ^organization^ as established by<br/>
the Twelve.</p>

[[Sweetwater River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Sweet Water]] with [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor's]] company and also [[Edward Hunter|Edward Hunter's]]<br/>
The ground was covered with snow which continued to fall till evening.</p>

<p>The Hundred prepared a feast for the whole<br/>
Pioneer Camp and furnished a table here in the wilderness in<br/>
fine style. Our feast consisted of roast and broiled beef</p>",
42658.0,295,,"<p>pies cakes biscuit butter Peach sauce coffee tea sugar and a great variety of good<br/>
things. In the evening the Camp had a dance but the Twelve met in council<br/>
at brother [[Vincent Shurtleff|Shirtliff's]] tent and transacted the business that came before them<br/>
for adjustment.</p>

<p>Fourteen miles were travelled farther on the morrow and<br/>
then we met brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M Grant's]] Hundred.</p>

<p>Brother Grant had burried a [[Margaret S. Grant|child]] on the road and<br/>
his [[Caroline Van Dyke Grant|wife]] lay at the point of death.</p>

<p>In the evening we held a council and heard from <br/>
Brother Jedediah the circumstances of the organization of the companies<br/>
and Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] said he was more than ever convinced that there was<br/>
wrong in this matter. Brother Grant also related his interview with<br/>
Col [[Thomas Leiper Kane|T Cane]] who had the Spirit of the Lord with him and was working<br/>
for us but [[Thomas Benton|Thomas Benton]] was our inveterate enemy and was doing <br/>
all he could against us.</p>

<p><u>Our Horses Stolen By The Indians</u></p>

<p>The alarm was given early next morning that a lot of<br/>
our horses and mules were stolen. Bells were found cut from the<br/>
horses the lariettes cut an arrow picked up and other Indian signs. The<br/>
trail was finally found and a company of 20 horsemen started after<br/>
the Indians.</p>

<p>It looked gloomy to see so many women and children<br/>
here in the mountains with their horses and cattle stolen and breaking<br/>
down so late in the season. Thirty horses were taken from the<br/>
Pioneer Camp and 20 from the other camps which was quite crippling<br/>
to us.</p>

<p>The camps remained together during the day<br/>
and in the evening assembled for meeting and was addressed by<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and Brigham Young.</p>

<p>During the evening 2 of our brethren returned who<br/>
had been in pursuit and brought back five of the horses. </p>",
42658.0,296,,""">September the 21st 1847</time></u></p>

<p>Two weeks later than the time when the Indians stole so many<br/>
horses from us we had another immensely exciting Indian fray.</p>

<p>About 9 o'clock in the morning the call was made<br/>
to get our horses. I started for them in the timber half mile from<br/>
Camp. When I got about two thirds of the way to the horses<br/>
one of the most exciting scenes occurred I ever witnessed.</p>

<p>I hear several reports ^of  guns^ in quick succession<br/>
and our Guard cry ""Indians! Indians!""</p>

<p>In less than a minute the timber<strike>ed</strike> ^and^ bluffs were<br/>
lined with mounted Indians charging with all speed upon our guard horses<br/>
and camp. They shot at two or three of the guard but missed them<br/>
One of our guard <strike>they</strike> ^two of them^ took and tried to carry him off <strike>on his horse</strike>. He<br/>
knocked <strike>some of</strike> them down with his fist and got away. Some<br/>
of the brethren snaped their guns but they missed fire.</p>

<p>As soon as I heard the report of guns and<br/>
the cry of Indians and saw them driving off our horses and gathering thick <br/>
and fast upon every hand being without either horse or arms I ran<br/>
to camp with all speed and gave the alarm and called upon all to<br/>
gather their arms and mount their horses.</p>

<p>Brothers [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] [[William Matthews|Mathews]]<br/>
and several others sprang on to their horses with their guns and pistols<br/>
and ran to stop the horses which the Indians were taking away.</p>

<p>One party of Indians had driven <strike>five or</strike> ^about^</p>",
42658.0,297,,"<p><strike>six</strike> ^a dozen^ horses and mules over the hills. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] took after them. Two <br/>
Indians had gone over the Bluff with my horse and mule: Brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] took<br/>
after them and at the same time about 20 of our horses came rushing towards<br/>
camp frightened by the Indians. With great exertion President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and<br/>
one or two other brethren succeeded in stoping them and getting them into<br/>
our camp.</p>

<p>As soon as I arrived in camp I opened my trunk<br/>
took out my belt containing 8 pistols ^shots^ and <strike>harnessed</strike> ^buckled^ it on to myself as quick<br/>
as possible put a saddle and bridle on to a broken down horse for want of<br/>
a better one and mounted without spu<strike>p</strike>r or whip and gave chase after my<br/>
own horses. I could not ride very fast over the rough ground and bluffs<br/>
on a poor horse but I went as fast as I could.</p>

<p>As soon as I began to rise the bluffs I saw<br/>
Indians gathering thick on every hand closing in between me and the camp<br/>
As I passed one Indian he was priming his gun. But I continued the<br/>
chase.</p>

<p>While putting up a ravine with steep bluffs on<br/>
each side an avalanche of some 30 Indians rushed down upon me and<br/>
hedged me in so that I could not get out. Within a few feet of me<br/>
a large Indian drew a gun upon me. I presented a six shooter<br/>
at his breast and gave a yell which I had no sooner done than he<br/>
gave a whoop and ran up the hill and left me and all the other Indians<br/>
surrounding me followed his example and ran.</p>

<p>As soon as my horse and mule had got over their<br/>
fright and got out of sight of camp they tried to return to it and troubled<br/>
the Indians in driving them and brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] soon came near<br/>
them and one stoped and met him when they found they were overtaken<br/>
and professed friendship but the other still tried to drive off the horses<br/>
and brother Rockwood fired a pistol at him and he ran and the other<br/>
Indian did the same and brother Rockwood started my horses towards<br/>
me and I soon came to his assistance also some other brethren and<br/>
we catched them.</p>

<p>While this was going on nearly 40 Indians</p>",
42658.0,298,,"<p>surrounded brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and some of the brethren started to his assistance.</p>

<p>Indians were also upon every side ^of me^ until 2 got to<br/>
the camp and the brethren who had helped me had gone to the aid of<br/>
brother Kimball.</p>

<p>By this time 150 warriors had gathered close to<br/>
our camp all dressed in the greatest still for a war charge; and the <br/>
old chief began to address at the top of his voice the Indian band and<br/>
also our camp telling us that they were good Sionx and they had thought<br/>
we were Crows or Snakes.</p>

<p>When they found they could not get any more<br/>
of our horses and that three had been re-taken which they had stolen<br/>
they professed friendship. There were 11 horses in all taken by<br/>
the Indians who numbered about 200 warriors on the ground who<br/>
were well mounted and there were not more than 20 <strike>me</strike>of our men<br/>
including our guard who were engaged in any way against them<br/>
in stoping them or retaking our horses.</p>

<p>Brother [[Samuel Gould|Gould]] took one Indian horse<br/>
and all and another Indian brought back [[Thomas Woolsey|Thomas Woolsey's]] horse<br/>
which was among the stolen and exchanged him for the Indian<br/>
horse. This with my two horses were the only ones<br/>
retaken during the skirmish.</p>

<p>But when the Indian Warriors gathered<br/>
before our camp they saw that we as a body were armed and that we <br/>
knew them and had treated them kindly on our way to the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]].</p>

<p>The old chief then proposed that we smoke<br/>
the pipe of peace and said that if our chief pointing to President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
would go to their camp they would smoke with him and give up<br/>
the horses which his men had taken. Brother Brigham was not<br/>
well and we did not think it prudent for him to go.</p>

<p>While in this conversation with the Indians<br/>
Brother Kimball who had been out on the chase after the horses returned<br/>
bare headed (having droped his hat) accompanied by brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]]<br/>
and in riding into camp rushed his horse through the midst of the.</p>",
42658.0,299,,"<p>Indians and they fearing some treachery or that he was an enemy coming upon them<br/>
in the rear instantly leaped upon their horses scattered and dashed from the camp<br/>
some running into the creek and all appeared in great fright; but as soon as they<br/>
saw that no harm was designed they returned and took their places and had a<br/>
hearty laugh at their fright.</p>

<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] volunteered to accompany the<br/>
chief into his camp in the place of President [[Brigham Young|Young]] that we might get our horses<br/>
I volunteered and also [[Stephen Markham|Stephen Markham]] volunteered to go with Brother Kimball<br/>
on the expedition and so we three mounted our horses and set out accompanied by<br/>
a Frenchman who could speak a little Sioux language.</p>

<p>The Indians told us their camp was one mile<br/>
away but we travelled 7 miles over Bluffs and Valleys before we came <br/>
in sight of their camp some three miles distant moving towards us.</p>

<p>So we halted and waited for them and they<br/>
came and pitched about 100 lodges. Their were some 600 Indians men<br/>
woman and children and they brought with them about 1000 horses and mules<br/>
all of which we supposed were stolen from emigrants and other tribes. Their<br/>
encampment presented a very picturesque and amusing appearance.</p>

<p>Among their horses we readily descovered ours<br/>
which were stolen on the night we camped with brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant's]] company<br/>
We lost 49 that night and they were here in the drove which these<br/>
Indians had.</p>

<p>The old chief called ^together^ the war chiefs and placed<br/>
them on his left hand and ourselves on his right and set down upon the<br/>
grass and filled a long pipe with <u>Keunicken<strike>n</strike>isick</u> and smoke and passed <br/>
it to his chiefs; they smoked and passed it to us and we also smoked<br/>
in turn.</p>

<p>The old Chief then pointed to us to pick out our<br/>
horses which we undertook to do but we found it no easy task to pick<br/>
out 8 or 9 horses scattered through one thousand others for one or two<br/>
miles up the creek.  However after a labor^i^ous search we got all<br/>
but two that were stolen this morning. We then spoke to him<br/>
about the 49 horses which they had stolen from us before and</p>",
42658.0,300,,""">24th</time> and<br/>
Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]], [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] and myself dined with [[Mr. Burdow|Mr. Burdow]]<br/>
and talked to him about our stolen horses. He informed us<br/>
that our company with the ox teams lost every horse they had but they<br/>
got them back excepting five. He gave us some encouragement of<br/>
sending an Interpreter with us.</p>

<p>We crossed the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Platte]] and pitched our<br/>
camp about 3 miles from the [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort]] and President Young called us together<br/>
and addressed us at some length and appointed 10 men to go and<br/>
visit the Indians to get our stolen horses and 25 men to follow after<br/>
to assist in case of necessity.</p>

<p>Next morning at 9 o'clock the first<br/>
company of 10 men commanded by Col. [[Stephen Markham|Markham]] started on their<br/>
Indian expedition and an hour afterwards the 2 of 25 men followed<br/>
<strike>han</strike>^under^ the command of Brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] but it was not long before<br/>
both companies returned having ascertained that a man had gone forward<br/>
to inform the Indians of our coming and to have them c<strike>k</strike>ache<br/>
up their horses.</p>

<p>In the evening we received word that Brothers<br/>
[[Luke Johnson|Johnson]] and [[Jesse Carter Little|Little]] had returned on the road to us and had fallen<br/>
in the with Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton|Stockton]] from the [[San Francisco Bay, California|Bay of San Francisco]] with<br/>
40 men going to the S[t]ates.</p>

<p>Next morning, Sunday, Brothers Johnson<br/>
and Little reached the Fort with two other brethren bringing us ten<br/>
horses for which we were indeed glad for we had as much as we<br/>
could do to get along and our horses were daily growing poor. Brothers<br/>
Young, Kimball and others dined at the Fort with Commodore Stockton.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we drove three miles</p>",
42658.0,301,,""">3rd</time><br/>
to get some meat. We started at daybreak and the wolves which had<br/>
rent the air during the night were dispersing in all directions as we rode<br/>
along and the beautiful swan in flocks were floating upon the Platte<br/>
adding beauty to the scene.</p>

<p>Soon a large herd of buffalo was in sight<br/>
and we left our horses and stole upon them the best we could and their<br/>
picket guards were frightened several times but we managed to re-assure<br/>
them. There is no well-diciplined army of men more particular<br/>
to have an old experienced guard on a close look out than a herd<br/>
of Buffalo.</p>

<p>By going under a bank we passed their guards<br/>
and <strike>lay</strike> ^<strike>lyn</strike>^ ^<strike>lying</strike>^ concealed until we were surrounded and the main bodies<br/>
were comming on to us with a heavy phalan<strike>s</strike>x of bulls meeting us<br/>
in the face with the cows fallowing in their rear.</p>

<p>When they were within a few rods of us we<br/>
thought it time to be up and doing for our own safety. I had a single<br/>
load in my rifle and a brace of pistols and Johnson a slide of six loads<br/>
in his rifle. He fired twice and they broke and ran. None were</p>",

in the night. They came upon him suddenly and he was<br/>

The company that came out to meet us went in front of our encampment<br/>
It was a hard day's drive as our horses were worn down and 30<br/>
miles were before us.</p>

<p>When within about one mile of Winter<br/>
Quarters a halt was made and the company was drawn up in<br/>
order and addressed by President [[Brigham Young|Young]] ^who dismissed the Pioneer camp with his blessing^ and then we drove into<br/>
the city in order. The streets w<strike>a</strike>ere lined with people to<br/>
shake hands with us as we passed along. Each drove to his<br/>
own home. Three days previous to my arrival I had<br/>
a [[Shuah Carter Woodruff|daughter]] born to me and I found both [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|mother]] and child doing <br/>
well and all cheerful and happy. &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>",
42658.0,305,,""">3rd of December</time> we met in conference<br/>
with the Saints on the East side of the river. Elder [[William Ivins Appleby|Appleby]] arrived<br/>
in our midst from [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] spent the evening with us and gave<br/>
us much information concerning the nation the wars &amp;c. He brought<br/>
as a present from Col. Kane a card of gold pens one for each of the<br/>
Twelve.</p>

<p>The conference next day was adjourned for three<br/>
weeks after having resolved to immediately build a large log tabernacle<br/>
for the people to meet in. [[Henry William Miller|Henry Miller]] was appointed the <br/>
committee and about 200 gave their names to go at once to work<br/>
It was to be about 65 by 40 feet in the cleer and the building was<br/>
to be under the direction of the Twelve.</p>

<p>Next day was an important one in the history<br/>
of the Church. We rode to Elder [[Orson Hyde|Hyde's]] had a good feast and<br/>
went into council and determined the following important matter:</p>",

<p>The brethren on the East side of the river had been busily building their<br/>
Log Tabernacle designed for this Conference and others which might follow<br/>

day appointed we held this one of the most important conferences of<br/>
the Church.</p>

<p>The Conference opened at 10 o'clock this day<br/>
according to appointment. [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] opened by prayer and Wilford<br/>
Woodruff addressed the meeting upon the object of calling the<br/>
Conference and was followed by Orson Pratt upon the same subject.<br/>
Others also addressed the assembly during the day.</p>",

<p>On the last and most important day of the Conference about 1000<br/>
souls were assembled in the Log Tabernacle.</p>

<p>[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] addressed the meeting in<br/>
the morning in the power of God and then the names of the Seventy<br/>
were called over and President [[Brigham Young|Young]] remarked that it would not be<br/>
necessary to put them to the meeting or to organized them into quorums<br/>
while here but to remain in a body under their Presidents until they <br/>
arrived at the Valley.</p>

<p>He said that any quorum of the Seventies<br/>
or the Twelve though scattered to the four corners of the earth and not<br/>
filled up in Zion yet as quorums would be full but when there was<br/>
a vacancy by death or apostacy then the vacancy might be filled.</p>

<p>From President Youngs teachings we learned<br/>
that it was necessary to keep up a full organization of the Church through<br/>
all time as far as could be: at least the First Presidency Quorum of<br/>
the Twelve Seventies and Patriarch over the whole Church.</p>

<p>It was then moved by<br/>
and seconded by and carried unanimously by the<br/>
body of the Church in Conference at Winter Quarters that Brigham Young<br/>
be the President of the whole Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day<br/>
Saints.</p>

<p>President Young then nominated Heber C.<br/>
Kimball to be his First Councillor which was seconded by<br/>
and carried unanimously.</p>",
42658.0,309,,"<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] afterwards nominated [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] as his<br/>
Second Councillor which was seconded by and<br/>
carried by a unanimous vote.</p>

<p>It was then moved by and<br/>
seconded by that President [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] be the Patriarch<br/>
over the whole Church.</p>

<p>Much important and interesting instruction was given<br/>
upon these and other subjects among which President Young spoke upon the<br/>
resurrection. He said there was nothing more to be learned by the people<br/>
upon the subject than what was written. It was made plain in<br/>
the Bible and other revelations and it was not a subject we wanted to<br/>
use at the present time as we had not come to the resurrection. There<br/>
was no person except a resurrected being who held the keys of the resurrection<br/>
Michael the Arch-angel or Ancient of Days who was Father [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] holds<br/>
the keys of the Resurrection.</p>

<p>The Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock on<br/>
the 6th day of April 1848.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year I had an interview<br/>
with President Young in the morning upon a variety of subjects among<br/>
which was that of my going East on a mission.</p>

<p><u>Sypnosis of 1847</u></p>

<p>The Twelve Apostles with their brethren 143 volunteers as<br/>
Pioneers had made a journey of more than one thousand miles to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky<br/>
Mountains]] and sought out a place for a city and a stake of Zion<br/>
that the Saints might have a place to flee to while the indignation<br/>
of the Law pass over the nation that had driven them out. We<br/>
had returned to [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] and with all our exposures sickness<br/>
and danger not a human life had been lost but all returned in<br/>
safety. The blessing of the Lord had been great upon</p>",
42658.0,310,,"<p>us as a people during this year in all the various portions of the Camp<br/>
of [[Israel|Israel]] and throughout the whole earth. While the past year<br/>
had also shown the fulfilment of prophecy in wars rumours of wars<br/>
and the many gathering signs of the times. The United States had<br/>
been engaged in war with [[Mexico|Mexico]] involving themselves in a debt<br/>
of one hundred and fifty millions of dollars and a loss of twenty five<br/>
thousand men on their side and double that on the Mexican side<br/>
famine had raged in [[Ireland|Ireland]] cholera through [[Europe|Europe]] and a new<br/>
era opened in the history of the Jews by the election of Baron<br/>

<p>President Young made some remarks concerning<br/>
appointing the First Presidency. He said, ""the Spirit of the<br/>
Lord has been with us and we know what is right. It would have<br/>
been our right to have appointed the Presidency the first Conference<br/>
we held after [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] death but it was not wisdom to do it.<br/>
We have <strike>now</strike> whipped all our enemies with one hand tied<br/>
behind us and <strike>now</strike> it is time to organize the Church.""</p>

<p>In speaking upon principle he said that<br/>
an honest man would not be dishonest neither would he follow<br/>
such men as [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] &amp; [[James Jesse Strang|Strang]]. The Sheep would follow such<br/>
as God sent even the Shepherds while dishonest men would<br/>
follow the wolves. The Lord will rule in his Kingdom<br/>
I know how things have been and are and will be:</p>

<p>""Some suppose that by appointing a<br/>
Presidency it is robbing some of the rising generation or taking<br/>
away some one's rights but it is not so.</p>

<p>""Concerning persecution I will say that the<br/>
Lord will cause the wrath of men to praise Him. The remainder<br/>
will the Lord restrain.""</p>",

however came; and the people were addressed by [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa<br/>

and got into an Omnibus to go to [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] but was blocked up<br/>
by the great procession marching through the city in celebration of the<br/>
introduction of the water from the Long Pond into the city of Boston.</p>

<p>This procession was two hours and 30 minutes<br/>
passing any given point and was considered the grandest display ever<br/>
made on any occassion in an American city and there was supposed<br/>
to be more people in Boston than ever known before. The procession<br/>
itself was said to be 7 miles long. Archways were formed across<br/>
the streets decked with evergreens and flowers and a pyramade<br/>
of evergreen and flowers overtop bearing a great variety of mottos.</p>

<p>The procession started from the [[Boston Common, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Common]]<br/>
15 minutes past 12 at noon. First came a powerful band of<br/>
Lancers. Then followed 30 military companies in full uniform<br/>
and several <strike>other</strike> bands of music. Next came the fire companies<br/>
of the city with their engines ornamented with wreathes flowers &amp;c;<br/>
following were the fire companies from the neighboring towns<br/>
After these came a cavalcade of 500 gentlemen and a few ladies<br/>
A boy's fire engine drawn by two ponies was followed by<br/>
two of the largest size water pipes mounted on a platform<br/>
drawn by seven black horses bearing the inscriptions: ""First<br/>
pipe laid April 19th 1847"": ""Water introduced into the city Oct 25<br/>
1848.""</p>

<p>After this came a brick layers platform<br/>
with impliments of their trade followed by a host of workmen.<br/>
Next were the Boston Boat Clubs with their boats and after<br/>
these the Boston Port society with a ship fully rigged and</p>",
42658.0,334,,"<p>manned under the command of Father [[Edward Thompson Taylor|Taylor]]: the[[Salem, Washington County, New York|Salem]] East Indian<br/>
Marine and the old Marine societies followed bearing in their ranks<br/>
the old Palanquin which had <sup>not</sup> been seen in public for 40 years<br/>
This was borne by 6 stout Negroes. In a carriage drawn by<br/>
4 horses was a large full rigged moddle of the famous but unfortunate<br/>
privateer the Grand Turk. Other carriages followed containing<br/>
specimens of American clocks goods carpeting &amp;c.</p>

<p>After these came Oak Hall expresses<br/>
Adams &amp; Mrs Ridders. A printing office passed on<br/>
wheels with workmen all at work strewing papers cards &amp;c among<br/>
the mass as they proceded onwards followed by Faneuil Hall<br/>
market in minature with a grand display of beef mutton pork<br/>
fowles fish vegitables &amp;c which I presume was a temptation<br/>
to the hungry crowded lookers on. The market men came next<br/>
in great force with badges on their hats.</p>

<p>A stuffed Elephant passed mounted upon<br/>
a carriage with 3 persons riding on his back; also an artifical<br/>
flower manufactory drawn by 6 horses containing 12 young girls<br/>
dressed in white all busy making flowers. There was an<br/>
apple tree filled with fruit with [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] and [[Eve (OT)|Eve]] picking it and<br/>
the serpant on the tree. All the Masonic and Odd Fellow's<br/>
societies of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] were in the procession and hundreds of flags<br/>
making a costly array were brorne [borne] onwards.</p>

<p>The first Division of the Procession was<br/>
under the direction of the honourable [[John C. Park|John C. Park]] and consisted<br/>
of the [[Josiah Quincy IV|Mayor]] of Boston Committee of Arrangements; Water Committee<br/>
Water Commisioners &amp; Engineers, Aldermen, President of the<br/>
Common Council, Members of the Common Council, High</p>

<p>Sheriffs of the State; the [[George Nixon Briggs|Governor]] and suite &amp;c, &amp;c, escorted<br/>
by the Boston Cadets and flanked by the city Greys. After<br/>
these was a long array of civil and military functionaries,<br/>
representatives of foreign countries bearing the tri colorured flag,<br/>
the Clergy, Medical Faculty, Editors, Members of the bar</p>",
42658.0,335,,"<p>Governments of the Neighbouring cities students of [[Harvard University, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Harverd University]], Mercantile<br/>
Library Association in full array and scores of other companies too numerous<br/>
to name.</p>

<p>All along the route of the Procession the public<br/>
buildings hotels and private residences were crowded with human beings<br/>
and the [[Boston Common, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Common]] was literally covered.</p>

<p>At half past 4 o'clock the Government of the<br/>
city headed by the [[Francis Tukey|chief marshal]] reached the Common and took their seats<br/>
on a decorated platform in the centre of the reservoir after which lengthy<br/>
speeches were made by the Mayor and Mr [[Nathan Hale|Hale]]. At the close<br/>
of the speeches the Mayor arose and said:</p>

<p>""Fellow citizens, it is proposed to admit the<br/>
waters of [[Lake Cochituate, Massachusetts|Lake Cochituate]] into the city. All those in favour<br/>
will say Aye!""</p>

<p>The response was in a voice of thunder. The<br/>
signal was then given and upwards gushed a pure column of water<br/>
8 inches in diameter 80 feet into the air and falling again into<br/>
the reservoir. The cheering of the people at this moment was<br/>
overwhelming. The night was passed with fireworks and<br/>
illuminations.</p>

<p>While beholding these things going on the<br/>
words of the Lord came with weight upon my mind which says<br/>
""Broad is the road that leads to death and thousands flock together<br/>
there while wisdom shows a narrow path with here and there<br/>
a traveller,"" I went to Brother [[Alexander Badlam|A Badlams]] and spent<br/>
the night.</p>

<p>Next day I took train with brother [[Nathaniel Corey|Nathaniel<br/>
Corey]] to [[New Bedford, Bristol County, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] and read an account of the burning of the<br/>
[[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] by our enemies.</p>

<p>After visiting the Saints at various places<br/>
and attending to Church affairs I reached [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] again and<br/>
found my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children at her sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss |Foss']]</p>

<p>Here I remained with our friends until</p>",
42658.0,336,,""">18th of Dec</time> I returned to my family at Cambridgeport.</p>

<p>All the papers and news of the day<br/>
were full of important and stirring events of the wars and<br/>
revolutions in [[Europe|Europe]] and startling developments ^in America^. Among<br/>
those of America was the discovery of Go[l]d by the Mormons<br/>
in upper [[California|California]] and the rush of the nation to the<br/>
gold field like the rushing of a horse to battle.</p>

<p>The cholera had again commenced in<br/>
[[New York|New York]] yet the gold panic was so much greater than<br/>
the fever of the cholera that it was hardly noticed.</p>

<p>Among the letters which I obtained on<br/>
my return to my family was one from [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] who</p>",
42658.0,337,,"<p>informed me that [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]] had come back to the Church had<br/>
made satisfaction and was voted to come in by the door of baptism. He<br/>
was the first man baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day<br/>
Saints in this last dispensation under the hands of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the<br/>
Prophet and one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon<br/>
After being out of the Church seven years he had now returned again.</p>

<p>Ten days more of ministeral labour in<br/>
[[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] and the year <time datetime=""1848"">1848</time> was brought to a close.</p>

<p>Sypnosis of 1848</p>

<p>During this year of our Lord 1848 the ""Fig Tree"" hath<br/>
rapidly put forth her leaves and blosomed for the summer. It<br/>
is a year which has laid the foundation for the fulfilment of<br/>
more prophecy and revelation than has been fulfilled in centuries<br/>
in other ages. Thrones have been cast down kingdoms<br/>
overturned the power of the [[Pope Pius IX|Pope]] of [[Rome, Lazio, Italy|Rome]] broken and he driven<br/>
from the papal dominion; and All the nations of the earth have<br/>
been convulsed. Revelations wars anarchy and confusion have<br/>
followed each other in rapid succession; cholera plagues and<br/>
famine came in the train and last of all though not the least<br/>
in importance the foundation is laid for the dissolution<br/>
of the American Government. While these things were<br/>
going on a spirit has prevailed for the return of the Jews<br/>
and the rebuilding of [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]; some 7000 Latter-day Saints<br/>
have gathered into the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|valley]] of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] by the [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Great<br/>
Salt Lake]] and the Saints in the valley of [[Sacramento, Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]]<br/>
have discovered vast quanties of gold the report of which has<br/>
ran like electricity through the world and tens of thousands<br/>
are flocking to the gold fields of [[California|California]].</p>

<p>The revolutions of [[Europe|Europe]] commenced with<br/>
[[France|France]]. The people rose <u>en</u> <u>masse</u> and had a three days</p>",
42658.0,338,,"<p>^fight^ at the end of which they drove [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philipi]] out of [[France|France]] with all the<br/>
royal family. The people entered the T[ourelles] took the throne<br/>
upon their shoulders carried it into the streets and dashed it to pieces<br/>
on the ground. They then undertook to establish a Republican<br/>
government.</p>

<p>It was said that in the first 3 days fight<br/>
there were only 500 killed; but afterwards a reaction took place with<br/>
a fight and some 15000 killed. Finally they organized a government<br/>
and at the end of '48 the world was anxiously waiting the election of<br/>
a President of the French Republic and prophesying much future<br/>
bloodshed before the issue of this revolution was reached.</p>

<p>The German States and [[Prussia|Prussia]] next<br/>
followed in revolution. [[Austria|Austria]] arose and drove her [[Ferdinand I|king]]<br/>
from his throne but he afterwards returned with his armies<br/>
and bombarded [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] 8 days and reorganized his kingdom<br/>
giving to his people a milder form of government and more<br/>
toleration and still his throne was in danger.</p>

<p>The [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperior]] of [[Russia|Russia]] had also much<br/>
war and his throne was in some uncertainty the Irish had<br/>
made a struggle to throw off the British yoke but failed. The<br/>
inhabitants of [[Rome, Lazio, Italy|Rome]] had risen up in their might and compelled the<br/>
[[Pope Pius IX|Pope]] to change after change and at last dashed his power to the<br/>
earth assassinated his councillors and driven ^him^ from the Papal<br/>
chair which has stood unshaken for centuries and he has sought<br/>
protection by fleeing to other nations.</p>

<p>While this was going on in foreign<br/>
countries turn our eyes for a moment to America. She was<br/>
a nation blessed above all other nations under heaven yet she<br/>
had recently shed the blood of Apostles Prophets Patriarchs<br/>
and Saints and had suffered mob rule to take the place<br/>
of Constitution law and order. And what position is he<br/>
in at the close of this year. One of her States [[Ohio|Ohio]] has<br/>
disgraced herself by her Legislature sitting for weeks in</p>",
42658.0,339,,"<p>fighting for mastery instead of organizing and doing the business of the<br/>
people; and the leaders of the whole nation herself at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] had<br/>
also been <strike>engaged in</strike> ^engendering^ the spirit of party strife hatred disunion and war<br/>
They had met in seperate parties laying plans for the disolving of the<br/>
Union and the anihilation of the American Government and while<br/>
the Senators and Statesmen of the Slave States have met in convention<br/>
and resolved that if slavery in the District of Columbia was abolished<br/>
or prohibited in [[California|California]] they would immediately disolve the<br/>
Union lay Taxes upon the shipping of the free States &amp;c, the citizen<br/>
and Statesmen of the free States had also met and had resolved upon<br/>
the struggle between North and South unless they could carry their<br/>
measures.</p>

<p>Yet while parties were growing more and<br/>
more determined and divided the public mind seemed to be blinded<br/>
as to the result of these movements and ignorant of the fruit which<br/>
would grow up from the seed of their own sowing. They had<br/>
eyes but saw not, ears but hear not, hearts but do not understand.""<br/>
But the servants of God and his Prophets have seen the end with<br/>
as much certainly as did [[Noah (OT)|Noah]] [[Lot (OT)|Lot]] and Jesus the things<br/>
concerning [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] Sodom and Gomorrow [Gomorrah] and the antedelivuan<br/>
world.</p>

<p>During the past year also the Asiatic<br/>
cholera had marched through the earth had arrived in the<br/>
States and was sweeping down its thousands daily.</p>

<p>Turning our eye towards Zion on the other<br/>
hand the Lord had been favouring for. The Church of<br/>
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been organized with<br/>
a First Presidency—namely [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] who had gathered to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] of<br/>
Israel in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] of the [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]] took with<br/>
them about 3000 souls some 8000 head of  cattle making<br/>
at this date a population of about 7000 Saints in the City<br/>
of the Great Salt Lake; while those of the Brethren who</p>",
42658.0,340,,"<p>had located near the [[San Francisco Bay, California|Bay]] of San Francisco had discovered mines of wealth<br/>
in gold and other precious and useful ore which had created an immense<br/>
excitement throughout the world.</p>

<p><u>My Travels in 1848</u></p>

<p>I travelled during this year 4850 miles</p>

<p><u>Meetings &amp; Councils</u></p>

<p>I attended with the Twelve Apostles 12 Councils<br/>
and I held during the year of public meetings 44</p>

<p>I baptized 14 persons confirmed 14 ordained to<br/>
the office of Patriarch [[Jarius Sandford|Jurious Sanford]] aged <strike>88</strike> 85 and also<br/>
ordained one President of the Seventies.</p>

<p>Administrations &amp; Blessings</p>

<p>I administered to 20 sick persons some of whom were<br/>
remarkably healed and glorified God and I blessed according<br/>
to the order of the Church 10 children.</p>

<p>I wrote 60 Letters and received 39.</p>

<p>Thus had been the events and general affairs of the world<br/>
of the Church and myself during the year 1848 and the<br/>
Spirit whispered to me that the year eighteen hundred and<br/>
forty nine would be a year of calamities and moment<br/>
to the nations of the earth.</p>",
42658.0,341,,""">1st day of the year 1849</time><br/>
the Steamer Europia arrived bringing news of the election of Prince<br/>
[[Napoléon III of France|Louis Napoleon]] as President of the [[France|French Republic]]; also of the <br/>
abdication of the Emperor of [[Austria|Austria]] in favour of his young<br/>
nephew and of dreadful starvation in [[Iceland|Iceland]] and the raging<br/>
of the Cholera in [[Europe|Europe]]. Tidings also from [[South America|South America]]<br/>
was of a similar character. At [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] the cholera was<br/>
raging to such a frightful extent that the inhabitants were<br/>
fleeing business suspended captains mates clerks and hands<br/>
dying off and the steamboats had to stop running.</p>

<p>I received a letter brought by brother<br/>
[[William Goodridge|Goodridge]] from brother [[Josiah Gile Hardy|Josiah G. Hardy]] wishing me to visit a<br/>
sister who was possessed of an evil spirit so I accompanied<br/>
him to [[West Newbury, Essex County, Massachusetts|West Newbury]] 40 miles.</p>

<p>I tarried around this neighbourhood<br/>
until the 8th and then returned to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] to my family.</p>

<p>Next day I received letters from<br/>
[[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] and [[Dan Jones|Dan Jones]] from [[England|England]]. Brother Jones</p>",
42658.0,342,,"<p>expressed his feelings on warm terms concerning my letters to him and<br/>
said he felt encouraged by them to go ahead in the name of the Lord.<br/>
He informed me that he had raised up a Branch at [[Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorgan, Wales|Myrther]] of over<br/>
800 members and the total of members of the Churches raised up by<br/>
him in [[Wales|Wales]] was 2747.</p>

<p>The whole representation of the Churches in<br/>
[[England|England]] ^[[Scotland|Scotland]] and Wales^ represented at the General Conference at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] Aug 14th<br/>
1848 amounted to 350 Branches 929 Elders 1185 Priests,<br/>
608 Teachers 341 Deacons, 17902 members. There had<br/>
been added since May 31st 1846, 8467 souls to the Church<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] was now the President of the Churches in the<br/>
[[British Isles|British Isles]].</p>

<p>Elder [[Dan Jones|Dan Jones]] added ""I have<br/>
published in the Welsh language 48 different kinds and<br/>
size of pamphlets comprising more original matter than the<br/>
Book of Mormon Doctrines and Covenants and voice of<br/>
Warning and have circulated one million eight hundred<br/>
thousand of pages all of which preach night and day to<br/>
rich and poor the eternal truths of Mormonism and<br/>
cheer the honest hearted. Many learned and some very<br/>
noted men have embraced the work. I have been <br/>
enabled to subdue my foes many of the gifts of the Spirit<br/>
are manifest. One young man who had been deaf and<br/>
dumb 8 years was healed when coming up out of the waters<br/>
of baptism so he both heard and spake was ordained<br/>
to the Priesthood and is now preaching the Gospel with<br/>
success.""</p>

<p>Captain Dan Jones was adding<br/>
to the Churches in Wales 150 per mouth. Elder<br/>
[[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] also wrote to me many good things<br/>
He said in his letter to me:</p>

<p>""The work is rolling forth in<br/>
much power. I have been of late stiring up the</p>",
42658.0,343,,"<p>Saints to pay their tithing. I have visited many of the Conferences and feel<br/>
encouraged to believe I shall gather a good sum for the Temple.</p>

<p>The addition to the Churches continue to<br/>
be great. The migration falls much short of the increase. There<br/>
may be 1500 Saints emigranted this season but what is that among<br/>
so many</p>

<p>""The Saints wax very bold and utter their<br/>
testimony with much assurance in the Holy Ghost. It is truly<br/>
delightful to see them pushing sectarian churches and demolishing<br/>
human creeds as so much hay and stubble. The weak are<br/>
becoming strong and the Gentiles marvel.</p>

<p>""You would be astonished to see the issue of<br/>
books stars and tracts from the Star Office. Every fortnight<br/>
the issue of Stars has doubled since I took charge in '47 and<br/>
all other works in equal ration and the tide of truth rolls<br/>
irresistibily through the land.""</p>

<p>Some two weeks later [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Almon W. Babbit]]<br/>
called upon me and spent the evening and conversed upon a variety of<br/>
subjects. He had been to [[Washington|Washington]] and had spent a length of time<br/>
and called to see me to induce me to go there with him and get<br/>
an introduction to the members of Congress in case the Church should<br/>
wish me to do any business there another year. He said he had<br/>
been labouring while there to so arrange the Territorial bills<br/>
as to have a Territorial government in the Great Bason [[North America|North America]]<br/>
to be called the [[Utah Territory|Utah Territory]] embracing 300 miles in length<br/>
He thought it would be necessary for the inhabitants of [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Great Salt<br/>
Lake Valley]] to organize a State government &amp;c. He had got<br/>
a Post Office established at [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] and Elder [[Joseph Haywood|Haywood]]<br/>
appointed Post Master; also had got Post Offices established at<br/>
[[Garden Grove, Unorganized County, Iowa|Garden Grove]] &amp; [[Mount Pisgah, Union County, Iowa|Mount Pisgah]]. He was very familiar with the<br/>
members from [[Iowa|Iowa]] and [[Illinois|Illinois]] and [[Thomas Benton|Thomas Benton]] of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
came to him just before he left and shook hands with him familiarly<br/>
After hearing all Almon Babbit had to say I concluded that he</p>",
42658.0,344,,""">24th</time> I received three letters from<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] and [[Dominicus Carter|Dominicas Carter]] from the<br/>
[[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Bluffs]] and two from the [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Valley]] one from [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A.O. Smoot]].</p>

<p>The letter from brother Smoot gave an<br/>
account of the affairs in the Valley since his arrival there. He<br/>
said the organization of the Presidency was received in the Valley<br/>
and all business attended to that was necessary and wrote of the<br/>
ravages of the crickets upon the crops &amp;c.</p>

<p>George A. Smith and E. T. Benson wrote<br/>
that they had organized 50 Branches of the Church at Council<br/>
Bluffs and all were doing well. Most of the brethren who<br/>
went into the army had returned to their families. They had<br/>
built a new [[Kanesville Tabernacle, Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Tabernacle]] in [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Pottawatomie County]]. Brother [[Howard Egan|Egan]]<br/>
and 12 others had arrived on the 7th of Dec with the latest news<br/>
from [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]]. They left on the 13th of October.<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] had arrived at the Valley on the 20 of Sept<br/>
and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] on the 24th. [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] had<br/>
been appointed President of the Stake and [[John Young Jr.|John Young]] and [[Erastus Snow|Erastus<br/>
Snow]] his councillors. Arrangements were being made for<br/>
inclosing an additional field of 1100 ^acres^; 860 men had taken shares<br/>
in it varying from 5 to 10 acres the smallest lots being near<br/>
the city to accomodate the mechanic. All the buildings of<br/>
the fort were to be moved on to city lots except the square<br/>
enclosed by the Pioneers. The Indians were friendly and<br/>
it was considered safe to settle on farms. A new city<br/>
had been laid out 10 miles North of the Temple Block and<br/>
another about 10 miles South. All the lots surveyed<br/>
had been taken up and an addition had been made running<br/>
to the mountains on the East side. The Pioneers claims</p>",
42658.0,345,,"<p>were to be respected. Elder [[Addison Pratt|Addison Pratt]] had arrived from the [[Sandwich Islands|Sanwich<br/>
Islands]]; a company of Saints that went to [[California|California]] on board the Brooklin<br/>
were <u>en route </u> for the Valley; [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]<br/>
were within three days drive of [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] when the express<br/>
left and Dr Richards was driving his own team.</p>

<p>Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] wrote that they had raised<br/>
squshes in the Valley from 63 to 84 lbs and turnips 8 1/2 lbs.</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]] made a vegitable dinner for<br/>
the Presidency when they arrived and in the bill of fare were<br/>
items: green corn green peas green beans cucumbers beets<br/>
parsnips carrots onions potatoes turnips squashes pumpkins<br/>
pies cabbage mush mellons water mellons cantelopes, corn<br/>
bread, wheat bread, corn stalk, molasses rost beef &amp;c.</p>

<p>[[Chief Walker|Walker]] the famous Utah Chief had<br/>
visited the Saints in the Valley with his band of rifflemen<br/>
He said he always wished to live in peace with our people.<br/>
He wanted his children to grow up with ours as brothers. His<br/>
people should not steal from our people: if they did we were to<br/>
let him know and he would punish them and stop it. The<br/>
brethren told him they did not want his men to steal from the<br/>
Californians for we were at peace with them. Walker replied<br/>
my men hate the Spaniards and will steal from them and<br/>
I cannot help it.</p>

<p>Brother [[Daniel Browett|Danial Browett]] Allen and Cox<br/>
were all killed by a band of diggers in the Californian mountains<br/>
as they were exploring a new pass through the mountains<br/>
They were surrounded when asleep and killed with stones. One<br/>
hundred dollars worth of gold dust was found on the ground belonging<br/>
to brother Allen. Their bodies were stripped of their clothes<br/>
and then buried by the Indians. This occured 40 miles<br/>
from the settlement on the [[Sacramento River, California|Sacramento]]. Their bodies were<br/>
found by a company who followed them. These brethren<br/>
I baptized in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] soon after I commenced preaching</p>",
42658.0,346,,"<p>at [[John Benbow|John Benbows]]. Brother [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] especially had been an earnest true<br/>
hearted Latter-day Saint and I know nothing to the contrary of the<br/>
others. They went into the army as soldiers in the Mormon Battalion<br/>
and have died as martyrs in their mission.</p>

<p>Brother [[Dominicus Carter|Carter]] wrote that during the<br/>
Conference in the Valley [[Lyman Wight|Lyman White]] had been retained in<br/>
his standing for they did not know that the Church had withdrawn<br/>
fellowship from him at the [[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Bluffs]] nor had received his pamplet.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of Feb I received 24 Nos<br/>
of the Millennial Star and from a letter written by [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley<br/>
P. Pratt]] August 1848 I gathered the following concerning<br/>
the prosperity of the Valley in the first year of our settlement:</p>

<p>""We are blessed in gardens in wheat and<br/>
corn and in all things I have set my hand unto. I have<br/>
raised some sixty bushels of good wheat without irrigation<br/>
a few bushels of rye and oats and my corn in the field<br/>
looks as well as any corn I ever saw in the States. The<br/>
wheat crop exceeds all expectation. Oats do better than in the<br/>
States say 60 bushels to one of the sowing in good ground. Every<br/>
kind of vegetables suited to the Northren latitudes does well<br/>
[[Levi Ward Hancock|Levi Hancock]] sowed seven pounds weight of [[California|California]] wheat<br/>
on the 14th of April and reaped 22 bushels the latter part of <br/>
July. He sowed half a bushel of common English wheat<br/>
on an acre and half and reaped upwards of twenty bushels<br/>
One grain of seven eared wheat produced seventy two ears<br/>
Barley that was sown ripened and was reaped and carried<br/>
off. The land then was irrigated and produced from the<br/>
roots a fresh crop four times the quantity of the first crop<br/>
Oats that were sown produced a good crop and cleared. The<br/>
roots again sprung up and produced another beautiful crop<br/>
Three crops of peas ripened on the same spot of ground and<br/>
the peas of the crop raised used for seed. Beet sead planted<br/>
this Spring produce beets as thick as a mans leg and go to</p>",
42658.0,347,,""">15th of February</time> I wrote a letter<br/>
to President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and Council containing two sheets of foolscap<br/>

years of age. The following is an extract from a letter written<br/>
by me this day to [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]:</p>

<p>[[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] March 1st 1849</p>

<p>Elder Pratt:</p>

<p>Beloved Brother,</p>

<p>As this is my birthday also the first<br/>
day of Spring my mind is led more than usual this morning<br/>
to reflect upon the signs of the times and while meditating upon<br/>
Zion and her swift Messengers my mind flies across the<br/>
ocean to a large company of them who are the ""horns"" of [[Joseph (OT)|Joseph]]<br/>
to push the people together from the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>These meditations create a desire to<br/>
converse a few moments with Brother Pratt. So while all<br/>
nature is locked fast in sleep before the dawn of day which awakes<br/>
man from his slumber I seat myself to say a few words<br/>
to you.</p>

<p>I said this was my birthday. Yes I<br/>
am 42 years old this day. How such figures look to a<br/>
man while counting up his years in this probation. The<br/>
very sight of them crowd into ^ones^ mind a flood of thought even<br/>
more than tongue can utter or pen can write. The<br/>
last sixteen years of my life has been spent in endeavouring</p>",
42658.0,349,,"<p>to preach the Gospel and build up the kingdom of God in connection with<br/>
my brethren.</p>

<p>The past is gone. I have no desire to recall<br/>
it. I would not wish to live my life over again if I could. I <br/>
feel like looking forward and not backward. I have a great desire<br/>
that I may spend my future days doing the works of righteousness<br/>
honouring the Priesthood and my calling saving the souls of men and<br/>
building up the Kingdom of God that I may have a place with the<br/>
faithful at the end of the race.</p>

<p>Turn my eyes which way I will either towards<br/>
[[Babylon|Babylon]] or Zion and I find the movements and signs of both fully<br/>
keeping pace with the wheels of time.</p>

<p>It is deeply interesting to see hear feel and<br/>
live in this age and gaze upon the scenery of the whole earth<br/>
which is rushing like a mighty cataract to finish its work.</p>

<p>While the Jews were highminded and in<br/>
the light of their pride the Son of God in Lamb like meekness<br/>
bowed to the ordinance of baptism and all the rites of the Gospel<br/>
and commandments of his father looking forward to the day when<br/>
he should make his second visit to his brethren with his reward upon<br/>
his head. So at the present day while Emperors Kings Princes<br/>
Lords Nobles Presidents and the great men of Babylon have<br/>
been making a desperate effort to maintain their dignity and<br/>
appear to good advantage before the whole earth many of the<br/>
noblest spirits that ever dwelt in flesh like Jesus and the Apostles<br/>
have been meekly submitting to the ordinances of the Gospel<br/>
and like little children been subject to the authority of the Holy<br/>
Priesthood. They have made every sacrifice required and<br/>
laboured day and night to build up Zion that the honest in<br/>
heart and meek of the earth may have a place to flee to<br/>
in order to escape the just judgement of that God whose rod<br/>
is now suspended in the heavens and about to fall upon the<br/>
earth and lay Great Babylon with all her greatness pomp</p>",

<p>When [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] sen. the First Patriarch of the Church<br/>
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints laid his hands upon my<br/>
head to give me my Patriarchal blessing he said I should<br/>
have my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] household standing with me in the<br/>
covenant of the Gospel and that I should have power to bring<br/>
them into the Kingdom. I afterwards visited my father's<br/>
household preached to them the Gospel and baptized my father<br/>
^[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]]^ [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] and every member of my father's household and several<br/>
other relatives. My wife also whose maiden name<br/>
was [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Carter]] received a promise that she should<br/>
have her father and his household in the new and everlasting</p>",

sisters were in the church her two brothers were now also very<br/>
friendly though her brother [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra]] had been much opposed till recently<br/>
and this day her father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Ezra Carter]] Sen. was baptized and<br/>
became a member of the Church. I walked through the<br/>
city of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] with my father-in-law and his grandson<br/>
[[Calvin Ichabod Foss|Calvin Foss]] who was going to [[California|California]] in the ship<br/>
Arealus which we visited; and after visiting many parts<br/>
of Boston we returned home and held a meeting at my <br/>
hired house<strike> which I hired</strike>.</p>

<p>I opened our family meeting by prayer Bro<br/>
[[Jesse Carter Little|Jesse C. Little]] then addressed us and [[William Page|William Page]] spoke and<br/>
then I arose and addressed my friends for an hour in much<br/>
plainness and in the expression of my feelings.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting I led my<br/>
father-in-law Ezra Carter Sen. with two others down into the<br/>
sea and baptized them. Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] accompanied her father<br/>
to the water and back again and we both felt to rejoice that<br/>
the words of the old Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] were fulfilled upon<br/>
our heads.</p>

<p>Father Ezra Carter was 76 years and three<br/>
days old at the time that I baptized him. He was the son<br/>
of [[Ezra Carter, b. 1739|Ezra Carter]] 84 years of age when he died, who was the son<br/>
of [[Daniel Carter, b. 1719|Daniel Carter]] who was the son of [[Ephraim Carter|Ezekiel Carter]]. The<br/>
mother of my wife's father bore the maiden name of [[Phoebe Whittemore Carter, b. 1735|Phebe<br/>
Whitmore]] and she was the daughter of [[Elias Whittemore|Elias Whitmore]]</p>

<p>Next day Father Carter Calvin Foss<br/>
William Page myself and Mrs Woodruff visited [[Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Mount Auburn]]<br/>
which is considered one of the most interesting cemetry's in<br/>
the world. We next visited [[Bunker Hill Monument, Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Bunker Hill Monument]] and<br/>
Father Carter though 76 years old walked to the top of that<br/>
monument 222 feet high. After taking our views<br/>
around we returned home.</p>",

and conversed with him upon the subject of the Priesthood. I then<br/>
laid my hands upon him and ordained him to the office of High<br/>
Priest and to the office of a Patriarch in the Church of Jesus Christ<br/>
of Latter-day Saints. It was fully manifested to me that he<br/>
was of the blood of [[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]] and the power of God rested upon us<br/>

Received From the First Presidency</p>

<p>[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]]</p>

<p>July 25, 1849.</p>

<p>Dear Brother Woodruff,</p>

<p>As our mail is now making up for the <br/>
States we cannot let so favourable an opportunity of communicating <br/>
with you pass unimproved.</p>

<p>Our prospects for grain are tolerably good and <br/>
if we are not flooded with immigration intending for the mines <br/>
but compelled to tarry here we should have plenty for the <br/>
ensuing year. Out wheat harvest is now at its height and <br/>
is coming off for better than appearance seemed to warrant <br/>
The spirit of industry which has ever characterized the Saints</p>",
42658.0,367,,"<p>of the Most High God has been brought to bear with wonderful effect upon <br/>
the burning and arid desert.</p>

<p>The next time that you encounter the hardships <br/>
privations and toil of a journey over the plains and mountains you <br/>
will meet with a very different reception from what attended your<br/>
first arrival here. Friends will greet your arrival and the products<br/>
of the earth will administer to your comfort.</p>

<p>Our city and [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Valley]] is fast improving <br/>
roads are being made and bridges mills and houses building on every <br/>
side with astonishing rapidity considering our circumstances and <br/>
the disadvantages under which we labour but the blessings <br/>
of health peace and union have attended us. Hence our prosperity.</p>

<p>We have a settlement in the [[Utah Valley, Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah Valley]] <br/>
and have extended North above the [[Weber River, Utah Territory|Weber river]]. We have <br/>
irrigated our land which is considerable labour but ^it^ will <strike>dimith</strike><br/>
diminish as we improve in fixtures and experience. One <br/>
thing is certain. All the necessary products of the earth <br/>
for the sustinance of man can be raised. You have <br/>
probably learned before this that we are endeavoring to <br/>
obtain a legal government from the United States. <br/>
Dr [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] is East upon this business and brother [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|A W<br/>
Babbitt]] will leave to morrow as our delegate to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]].</p>

<p>Our object is to gain admission as<br/>

<p>We had yesterday a celebration of the <br/>
anniversary of the arrival of the Pioneers in this Valley. It was a day <br/>
long to be remembered. Your [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] enjoyed it well being one of the 24 <br/>

<p>Ladies <strike>and</strike> Gentlemen—American Citizens:</p>

<p>Of necessity my address this evening must be <br/>
short; yet I will touch upon a few prominant items which I <br/>
consider important to the subject in which I feel deeply interested <br/>
There are certain events which stand forth in bold relief of deep <br/>
interest in the history of every nation under heaven. Therefore the <br/>
history of the Indians or their present condition has also a <br/>
deep interest — an interest of greater importance than at first <br/>
presents itself to the mind of the American people. Although <br/>
it may appear to them as covered with a cloud or buried <br/>
deep from their view yet it non the less exists</p>

<p>Then listen to me: I have deeply</p>",
42658.0,373,,"<p>studied the situtaiton and interest of of my brethren the Red Men for years and I <br/>
have resolved to call ^aloud^ upon the white man of this nation to give ear to my <br/>
petitions.</p>

<p>If you do not see the Indian Orator in your midst <br/>
making a display of oratory like the white man it is not because he <br/>
has not talent but because he has not the chance to exercise it.</p>

<p>1st: My object in visiting the United States is <br/>
to present a petition to this government that they may assist me in <br/>
concentrating the Indians together that they may live and not die. I <br/>
want Congress to grant them a portion of Territory that they can <br/>
call their own and be concentrated upon it that they may not be <br/>
driven from it any more. They once were the owners and occupiers <br/>
of the whole soil of all [[North America|North America]]. The white man came<br/>
and removed the Indians and continually have driven them until <br/>
they can see no hope but the grave before them.</p>

<p>I now ask in their behalf a territory to <br/>
settle them upon that they may have a permanent home forever <br/>
and come under the United States Government and become part <br/>
and parcel of the United States. In this matter I have studied <br/>
the <strike>history</strike>^interest^ of all both the white and the red man.</p>

<p>1st: give them a Territory that they can <br/>
call their own where their children can point to the graves of the <br/>
fathers and say, We can now live in peace and be driven <br/>
no more; we can visit the graces of our fathers with none to <br/>
drive us from them; and they will be inspired to engage in every <br/>
laudable untertaking that now marks the course of the white <br/>
man.</p>

<p>2nd You can then establish schools among <br/>
them that will be of benefit to them. They would obtain <br/>
knowledge and make a good use of it. The Gospel could <br/>
then be introduced among them and they would be far more <br/>
ready to receive it when they find the white man is consistant <br/>
and willing to do them good; but when the white man </p>",
42658.0,374,,"<p>offers the Gospel to the Indians one year and the next comes and drives <br/>
him from his home and the graces of his fathers he has no faith or <br/>
confidence in either the white man or his Gospel.</p>

<p>3rd you can then introduce agriculture amongst <br/>
them and they will receive it for they would then see of necessity they <br/>
must cultivate the land or dies. They could not depend upon game <br/>
for support and they would turn their attention to cultivating <br/>
the soil make improvements and take delight in them the <br/>
same as the white man.</p>

<p>4th They would then be in a position <br/>
where they would be delivered from the ill consequences of <br/>
constant removing which has continually followed them for <br/>
many years. The ill consequences of removing have <br/>
been multiplied and very great. This has been on main <br/>
reason why schools have been unproductive of good among <br/>
them. This is also the reason why missionaries have <br/>
done no more more good among them.</p>

<p>The Indians are fast decreasing and <br/>
passing away. That is the cause of all this. There are <br/>
various causes. There constant removing is one cause<br/>
Disease which has been introduced among them by the white <br/>
man in the capacity of traders missionaries and emigrants also <br/>
also the introduction of alcohol have had a tendency to waste <br/>
them away; also wars among themselves and wars with <br/>
the white man all of which have continually wasted away <br/>
the Indian tribes.</p>

<p>I will here remark that in the <br/>
origin of the wars with the whites the conducting of those <br/>
wars and in the treaties of peace made and broken the Indians<br/>
have been badly treated and abused by the whites</p>

<p>For instance some ruffian or tracker <br/>
visits the Indians introduces wild fire or alcohol among <br/>
them and will get the Indian drunk and perhaps drunk</p>",
42658.0,375,,"<p>himself and will cheat them in any way he can and perhaps kill some <br/>
of them and in his career he gets killed himself. Then the cry goes forth <br/>
that the savage Indians are killing and murdering the inhabitants of <br/>
the country. It is proclaimed in all the public journals of the <br/>
Union. Yes one side of the story is proclaimed as with peals <br/>
of thunder throughout the earth; but no voice is raised in behalf <br/>
of the poor Indian. Their story is not told. The world hear <br/>
it not; they do not enquire or ask for it. But as soon as the <br/>
story of the white man is known and proclaimed to the world the <br/>
armies of war must be prepared and soldiers sent forth to drive <br/>
and kill the Indians and burn their homes and in this way the most <br/>
desolating and expensive wars have been carried on for many <br/>
years until we feel it is time for the white man to take a<br/>
different course with the Indians,</p>

<p>As an example of the bad effects of <br/>
continually removing the Indians I would refer you to the [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee <br/>
nation]]. That people were fast improving following rapidly <br/>
in the footsteps of the white man had extensive farms and <br/>
good dwellings and continued rapidly advancing in improvements <br/>
until they were suddenly brought to a stand in their course by <br/>
being cruelly called upon by the State of [[Georgia|Georgia]] to give up their <br/>
lands and go away from the graves of their fathers into the <br/>
wilderness. And thus it was that thir mighty nation instead <br/>
of receiving that support ^encouragement^ and comfort from the nation that it ought <br/>
to receive was forced by the cruel hand of oppression to bow <br/>
^out see copy^ their heads in sorrow ^and despair^ until they shall be called to pass through <br/>
the same ordeal again to remove and remove until they are <br/>
anihilated from off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Oh Ye white man what encouragement <br/>
do you give the Indian to plant to build to learn to cultivate <br/>
the earth or receive a religion that professes love mercy <br/>
kindness and truth while those who profess to enjoy <br/>
it deals out such deeds of oppression and cruelty upon the </p>",
42658.0,376,,"<p>heads of the red <strike>man</strike>^men^ that it drives them to madness and despair.</p>

<p>Let the American nation stay their hands <br/>
from this time forth in their oppression and driving of the Indians lest <br/>
they drive them beyond a point which the Indian will endure and <br/>
return a blow upon the head of the white man which will fill many <br/>
a habitation with death.</p>

<p>Once give the Indians a Territory—a <br/>
home where they can have a full assurance that their ears or those <br/>
of their children will no more be saluted with a call to remove from <br/>
their lands then if if they do not show forth a spirit of improvement <br/>
then cast them off as not worthy of your support or attention but <br/>
until then you are not justified your garments are not clear.</p>

<p>The spirit of the age and times <br/>
demands that Congress should take immediate action upon this <br/>
matter. 1st: The Indians cannot retain their lands.<br/>
Emigration of the white men are already surrounding<br/>
them and in their midst and the richness and fertility <br/>
of the Indian<strike>s</strike> lands are a temptation to the white <br/>
man and invite him to settle thereon.</p>

<p>2nd the Indians have too much <br/>
land more than what they need to till and cultivate <br/>
for their support.</p>

<p>Let there be a Territory set off <br/>
on the North West of [[Iowa|Iowa]] North of [[Miller|Council Bluffs]]<br/>
on the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri]] on which there is no no white <br/>
settlement and let the Indians East of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky<br/>
Mountains]] and in the United States be gathered <br/>
up in it. Then let other Territories in the West be appropriated <br/>
and let all the Indians on the [[North America|North American Continent]] be <br/>
collected together and learn <strike>us</strike> to cultivate the earth. They will <br/>
soon associate themselves together and cease their wars among <br/>
themselves also with the white men. If there is not something <br/>
of this kind done the vast emigration through all the Indian </p>",
42658.0,377,,"<p>lands will soon destroy the game and then want and starvation will ensue and <br/>
this will bring on war between the white and red men.</p>

<p>If my proposition is accepted by the American <br/>
Government and they will carry it out it will be of vast benifit both <br/>
to the Indians and the people of the United States.</p>

<p>1st the benefit to the Indians will be: It will give <br/>
them a permanent home where schools can be established among them <br/>
and their children taught the English language. Farms can also be opened <br/>
among them and when they see they have a permanent home <br/>
for themselves and their children and they have no game to <br/>
depend upon for food they will immediately <strike>immediately</strike> go to <br/>
work and cultivate the earth like ^the^ white man. The Gospel <br/>
can then be introduced among them to a good effect and they will <br/>
receive it with thankfulness when they can be made to believe <br/>
that the hand that deals out the Gospel to them is not laying a <br/>
plan to take the advantage of them and preparing a way <br/>
to drive them from their home and country. It will not only <br/>
unite their intrest and attachment towards each other but <br/>
their regard and interest with that of the United States.</p>

<p>The benefit to the Government is less <br/>
expenses:</p>

<p>1st buying their lands and paying them yearly <br/>
annuities which is costing the government immense sums of <br/>
money.</p>

<p>2nd: The continual transporting of Indians <br/>
from place to place. There has laready been 96,000 Indians<br/>
removed by the Government.</p>

<p>3rd: The keeping of many Indian Agents <br/>
at great expence to Government could then be dispensed with.</p>

<p>4th: Fortifications have now to be <br/>
errected on the borders of all Indian tribes with the intention <br/>
of keeping the Indians in Subjection. These would not be <br/>
needed if the Indians were in a Territory of their own for </p>",
42658.0,378,,"<p>by having this trail clear and no encroachments of the white man upon <br/>
their borders there would be no cause of war or fortifications.</p>

<p>I am going to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] soom to lay my petition <br/>
before the Congress of the United States and urge them to grant my <br/>
prayer for the benefit of both the white and red man.</p>

<p>I want your aid: I want you to sign <br/>
my petition that the voice of thousands may be heard in behalf <br/>
of this petition. I want the names of legislators governors <br/>
and American Citizens in general that my prayer may be <br/>
heard and answered.</p>

<p>Give the North American Indians <br/>
a home a place where the soles of their feet can rest in peace <br/>
in a situation where you can teach them literature agriculture <br/>
and commerce and give them the chance the white man has <br/>
and I prophesy in the name of the Lord that there will <br/>
ere long be found among them their philosophers their <br/>
[[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]s and [[George Washington|Washington]]s who would do honour to <br/>
any civilized or Christian nation on the globe. But <br/>
let this nation turn a deef ear to my petitions and the <br/>
petitions of the Indians—continue to oppress them and <br/>
drive them to desperation and the hour is near when the Camp<br/>
fire will be seen upon many a hill. The war hoop will<br/>
re-echo from one end of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]] to the other. The <br/>
Indian will then sell his life as dear as possible and deal <br/>
out death whereever an opportunity offers. When this <br/>
blow is struck it will be terrible to all. May God <br/>
forbid that such a blow should fall at all that the <br/>
scenes of <strike>bloody</strike> Bloody Brook should <strike>ever</strike> ^any^ more be <br/>
enacted.</p>

<p>American citizens it is to ward <br/>
off this blow that I now stand before you—that I <br/>
now call upon this nation hearing a petition unto them</p>",
42658.0,379,,"<p>Among other remarks he said ""I applied<br/>
according to the wish of President [[Brigham Young|Young]] for a Territorial <br/>
Government. I had my last sad and painful interview <br/>
with President [[James Knox Polk|Polk]]. I found he did not feel to favour <br/>
your people and had his men of his own stamp picked <br/>
out to serve as Governor and other officers who would <br/>
have oppressed you in any way to fill their own pockets<br/>
He would not appoint men from among yourselves <br/>
and I saw it absolutely necessary that you should <br/>
have officers of your own people to govern you or <br/>
you were better without any government. I had <br/>
to use my own discretion and I withdrew the petition.</p>

<p>The Sacramento came alongside <br/>
the Clinton and took our freight on board which occupied <br/>
most of the day.</p>

<p>I felt thankful to God that we had <br/>
arrived at St Louis in safety and no lives lost and <br/>
up to this time we had no deaths among us but this <br/>
night Sister [[Margaret Montgomery Bird|Bird]] was taken sick with cholera and the <br/>
next <strike>day</strike>^morning^ she died.</p>",
42658.0,386,,""">15th</time> and left all the passengers and freight<br/>
not bound for the Bluffs and went on to [[Bethlehem, Unorganized County, Iowa|Deseret Depot]] <br/>
where we arrived about dark. Here I found my brother<br/>
in law [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] Brother [[Alexander Badlam|Badlam]] and many others. I <br/>
spent most of the night on my feet taking charge<br/>
of our baggage.</p>

<p>Next day I reached [[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Kanesville]]</p>",
42658.0,387,,""">18th</time> I again rode to Kanesville<br/>
with Elder [[Alexander Badlam|Badlam]] and [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]] spent a little time with <br/>
him and then went to Elder Hyde's where I found him and [[Orson Pratt|Orson <br/>
Pratt]].</p>

<p>I spent a long evening in conversation with <br/>
these brethren of the Twelve. Elder Hyde wished me to lay <br/>
before the Presidency in the [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Valley]] the affairs of the Church <br/>
in [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Pottawatamie County Iowa]]. He wished me to say <br/>
to them that all the men of capital were leaving for the <br/>
Valley; men from the East and [[England|England]] and all who<br/>
were able to go were making their fit out and talking of <br/>
starting.</p>

<p>There was another class he said who were <br/>
able to get a fit out in part even able to get waggons and <br/>
they were helped on by Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] so that the poorest<br/>
part of the community alone remained.</p>

<p>He did not think Kanesville and the <br/>
surrounding country should be broken up which would be the <br/>
case if it continued thus and wished me to lay the subject<br/>
before the Presidency with many more details that he gave<br/>
me of his views.</p>

<p>Elder Orson Pratt wished me to say to <br/>
the Presidnecy that there were many Elders in England of <br/>
power faith and talent who had to labour hard to get bread<br/>
for their famili<strike>s</strike>es and when Elders were sent to them from <br/>
America who could not edify them they felt it a tax upon <br/>
them and that their own Elders were more efficient in the <br/>
ministry than some of those sent unto them.</p>

<p>On the next day according to appointment<br/>
I met in Conference with Orson Hyde Orson Pratt and the <br/>
High Council near the Stand in the Grove one hour</p>",
42658.0,388,,"<p>before the General meeting.  Elder [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] addressed the Conference <br/>
in Substance as follows:</p>

<p>There was business left unfisnished at <br/>
the Conference which must be closed today. As some of <br/>
the officers were going to the Valley others must be appointed<br/>
Bishop [[Aaron Johnson|Johson]] wsa going and another Bishop must be <br/>
appointed in his place also men to visit the various<br/>
Branches who would attend the Council and carry the <br/>
Spirit of the Council to the people and bring back their <br/>
spirit to them. [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] and [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin <br/>
Clapp]] who were appointed last year were not with them <br/>
at all either in body or, spirit and whenever they did <br/>
attend a Council Joseph Young could not stay until <br/>
he went away. We will let that pass over we will <br/>
let them go.</p>

<p>Elder Hyde also remarked that it was <br/>
necessary to make arrangements to receive the poor<br/>
that had of late arrived among us. I have given <br/>
Counsel through the Guardian for the poor not to <br/>
come here and some have contrary to this counsel<br/>
through misguided zeal counselling them to come and <br/>
such must hear the consequences of it.</p>

<p>It was afterwards voted that <br/>
a Bishop be appointed to take the place of Bishop Johnson<br/>
and that Elder [[Lyman Stoddard|Stoddard]] be appointed to travel among<br/>
the Churches and call such men to his aid as he needed. Three men were appointed as committe<br/>
to locate the poor.</p>

<p>We then repaired to the Stand<br/>
before the congregation and each item of business<br/>
was presented to the people and Elder Hyde made<br/>
many remarks upon each item as it came along<br/>
and gave counsel to the people.</p>",
42658.0,389,,""">15th of June</time> and the next day I received instructions<br/>
from Elder [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] to organize our company whether they <br/>
were few or many. I could not organize it in full <br/>
until I had crossed the river.</p>

<p>We camped on Rattlesnake Hill</p>",
42658.0,390,,""">21st</time> I called the camp together<br/>
and organized them as follows:</p>

<p>[[Robert C. Petty|Robert Petty]] was appointed captain of the Hundred</p>

<p>[[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard W. Hardy]] captain of the 1st Fifty</p>

<p>[[Edson Whipple|Edson Whipple]] Captain of the Second Fifty</p>

<p>[[Joseph Hall|Joseph Hall]] Captain of the First Ten</p>

<p>[[James Currier|James Currier]] Captain of the Second Ten</p>

<p>[[Miner G. Atwood|Miner Atwood]] Captain of the 3rd Ten<br/>
Brother [[George Bryant Gardner|Gardner]] Captain of the 4th Ten<br/>
— Captain of the 5th Ten<br/>
— Captain of the 6th Ten</p>

<p>Remarks were made by Wilford Woodruff con<strike>c</strike>serning the <br/>
order of the camp and regulations for our journey strongly <br/>
opposing drinking swearing gambling whipping oxen &amp;c.</p>

<p>[[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus F. Carter]] had ten waggons of <br/>
merchandise and was appointed Captain over them but <br/>
in consequence of ^illness and^ the lateness of the season he concluded to <br/>
return home so we made out the report of our organization <br/>
and sent it by him to Elder [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]].</p>

<p>My brother in law [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus F Carter]] <br/>
left in my possession his train of merchandise which <br/>
with my own gave me 12 waggons 27 yoke of oxen 30<br/>
cows teamsters &amp;c under my personal care besides <br/>
the whole company to care for generally and this afforded<br/>
plenty of labour and anxiety. Several of the teamsters<br/>
were also not breth<strike>e</strike>ren and they were more difficult to <br/>
manage and during the journey they manifested much of <br/>
the Spirit of the devil and tried to make disturbance<br/>
in the Camp. They were gold diggers. Their object was </p>",
42658.0,391,,""">30th</time> of July the 1st division of our camp<br/>
was called to pass through one of those scenes so much <br/>
dreaded by all emigrant companies—namely, a stampede.</p>

<p>^of all^ <strike>All</strike> the oxen with the families<br/>
and waggons of the first division with the exception</p>",
42658.0,392,,"<p>of the ten baggage waggons which were in the rear <strike>s</strike>.</p>

<p>No person who has not witnessed one of these <br/>
terrific scenes can form any correct idea of them and it is almost<br/>
impossible to give an adequate description of it.</p>

<p>Behold 30 or 40 ox teams with from <br/>
2 to 5 yoke of cattle in each team attached to a family waggon <br/>
of goods women and children all in an instant like the twinkling <br/>
of an eye become frantic all dart off with lightning speed <br/>
running their own way bellowing rolling and tumbling over <br/>
each others waggons upsetting smashing their wheels axes and <br/>
tongues ^spilling^ <strike>upsetting</strike> the goods women and children for the next <br/>
teams to trample under feet as they roar and charge along <br/>
with their yokes bows and chains flying in every direction. <br/>
Such is a Stampede and the scene is not easily immagined<br/>
nor described.</p>

<p>Our Stamped commenced in the <br/>
following manner:</p>

<p>While my son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]] was getting on <br/>
to his horse [[William Murphy|William Murphy]] ^struck the horse horse with a whip and^ started ^his^ <strike>his horse</strike> into a <br/>
run and Wilford's <sup>horse</sup> ^was^ flung <sup>him</sup> over his head onto <br/>
the ground the saddle ^was turned^ under <strike>his</strike> ^the horses^ belley and he ran away <br/>
and as he approached one of the waggons Mr [[Marsena Cannon|Cannon]]'s <br/>
team became frantic and started off with great spead <br/>
In a moment 20 or 30 teams followed the example and<br/>
the whole encampment apparantly was rushing into the <br/>
jaws of Death.</p>

<p>I was by my carriage when this <br/>
commenced. In my carriage which was drawn by a <br/>
fine black steed were [[Rhoda Harriet Foss Richards|Rhoda Foss]] and [[Susan Cornelia Woodruff Scholes|Susan Woodruff]] <br/>
and we were at the head of the company.</p>

<p>I saw Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] rush into the <br/>
midst of the scene when she was in danger of her life every <br/>
instant with many other women and children. I told</p>",
42658.0,393,,"<p>[[Rhoda Harriet Foss Richards|Rhoda]] to let my horse run into the Bluffs and to do the best she could<br/>
and then I gave him a cut to start him into a run and left them <br/>
to their chance and the care of Providence and rushed into the <br/>
midst of the Stampede to try to save the life of my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and<br/>
as  many others as possible but I had hard work to save my <br/>
own life.</p>

<p>Mrs Woodruff soon found an opening<br/>
and fled out of the midst of the scene. Brother [[Robert C. Petty|Petty]]'s two <br/>
waggons were turned over. My family waggon with 4 <br/>
yoke of oxen ran over one of his and a waggon ran over <br/>
[[John Petty|one]] of his children ^+(out)^ [[Samuel Prescott Hardy|Prescott Hardy]] was knocked down <br/>
by his own team and badly wounded in the thigh and arm <br/>
Wherever I saw women or children in danger I did what<br/>
I could to rescue them but only little can be done at such<br/>
times except for each to dodge the best he can and save <br/>
his or her life if possible.</p>

<p>When I found I could do no more for <br/>
the encampment in general I ran forward to see what <br/>
state my carriage, family−waggon and family were<br/>
in. I found my noble horse still running <br/>
but on three legs. Rhoda was knocked out of the<br/>
carriage and [[Susan Cornelia Woodruff Scholes|Susan]] was lying flat upon the bottom <br/>
of the carriage with her feet hanging out between the <br/>
wheels and she was screaming aloud. I hollowed <br/>
for her to hold on until I came and she did so until<br/>
I caught the horse by the bit and stoped him and<br/>
rescued my daughter.</p>

<p>One of the ox teams had run on to <br/>
the horse and carriage bent one of the axes smashed<br/>
one of the horse's legs to pieces and knocked my <br/>
wife's <strike>sister</strike> ^niece^ Rhoda out of the carriage.</p>

<p>As soon as I got the horse out<br/>
of the carriage I went through the encampment to see who </p>",
42658.0,394,,""">2nd of August</time> we lost 20<br/>
head of cattle and I started out on the journey all who were able<br/>
to go and the rest of us went out to hunt cattle. I found<br/>
them in the Bluffs and drove them into camp and as the<br/>
men were out hunting cattle with the assistance of the<br/>
women and children I drove the encampment on and<br/>
when the men returned they found us gone and followed<br/>
and overtook us.</p>

<p>We got along well until we came<br/>
to the tremendious bluffs in [[Ash Hollow, Garden County, Nebraska Territory|Ash Hollow]]. Here my<br/>
teamsters [[Benjamin Watts|Watts]] and [[Brother Bess|Bess]] both smashed each a hind<br/>
wheel to pieces and broke every spoke out. I worked<br/>
until eleven o'clock at night to get the broken waggons<br/>
into camp and failing left them by the way side<br/>
and walked into Ash Hollow wearied out.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in<br/>
setting tires and mending waggons and the following<br/>
day being Sunday we held meeting and I advised<br/>
Elders [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Hardy]] and [[Robert C. Petty|Petty]] to go on with the first division<br/>
and I would stop and mend up and keep some of<br/>
the second division with me. This counsel was<br/>
heard with great surprise by the First Division and they<br/>
did not feel to leave me but after much reluctance<br/>
the next day they left me behind according to my<br/>
counsel and journeyed onward.</p>

<p>After 2 days tarry setting 80 tires</p>",
42658.0,395,,""">16th</time> I met in council<br/>
with Presidents Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards|Richards]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|P.P.<br/>
Pratt]] George A. Smith and others. President Young<br/>
was sick in bed. The subject was discussed of<br/>
establishing a trading company to do business for<br/>
the Church instead of letting the Gentiles come in<br/>
and gut the Church. We adjourned until next day.</p>",
42658.0,396,,""">19th</time> I moved my log cabins from<br/>
the old Fort on to my lot joining the [[Temple Square, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple-Block]]</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday and I met<br/>
with the Saints in the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and was called upon to address<br/>
the meeting. I spoke of my mission to the East and related<br/>
a dream. I dreamt of dying and going to the place of<br/>
departed spirits. I saw brothers [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]]<br/>
and many of the Saints who had died. They all appeared<br/>
to be in a hurry and I thought it strange to find them<br/>
so. I enquired the cause and was informed that the<br/>
time was set for Christ to come as the great Bridegroom<br/>
and they had not time to prepare as those in other dispensations<br/>
and they had to be in a hurry in order to get ready.</p>

<p>Next Sunday [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
address the meeting upon the words of [[Saul (OT)|Saul]] when he returned<br/>
from battle, ""Obedience is better than sacrifice. He spoke<br/>
much upon the subject of tithing and was followed by<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] who told the people the consequences of<br/>
neglecting this duty.</p>

<p>I met in council with the Presidency<br/>
in the upper room and had prayers before the Lord and<br/>
I read to them the speech of Mr [[George Copway|Copway]] the Indian Chief<br/>
and also the views of Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]] upon the Government of<br/>
Deseret which I had recorded in my daily journal.</p>

<p>The Presidency on reconsidering the<br/>
affairs which I had to settle for my brother-in-law [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus Carter]]<br/>
thought it wise for me to sell out his merchandize myself<br/>
and so I commenced to sell on the Monday morning and<br/>
the people crowded hard around my waggon to buy sug<strike>g</strike>ar<br/>
coffee &amp;c as they had not had a supply in the Valley.</p>",
42658.0,397,,"""> 22nd</time> I attended<br/>
meeting at the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and heard an interesting discourse<br/>
from President Young. His text was truth<br/>
his subject salvation his circuit the world<br/>
He said we see the child seeking the knife fork</p>",
42658.0,398,,"<p><strike>poison</strike> raisor or something to hurt itself with: so with many of<br/>
the Saints and Elders. They seek for that which is<br/>
not good for them and they know it not. Many seek<br/>
for things which tend to death and not life. [[Brigham Young|He]]<br/>
spoke of the desire of some to go to the mines their<br/>
use of tobacco and spirits &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the last of the year I met with<br/>
the Presidency and Council of the <u>Perpetual</u> <u>Emigrating</u> <u>Fund</u> <u>Company</u><br/>
and was appointed by the President a member of that body<br/>
and gave bonds to the sum of the thousand dollars for the<br/>
faithful performance of my duty as a member of that body<br/>
according to the rules governing the Council. [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Abraham<br/>
O. Smoot]] and [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard W. Hardy]] were my bondsmen.</p>

<p>Thus ended another year the former<br/>
part of which was occupied on my mission in preparing<br/>
for my return to the [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Valley of the Great Salt Lake]]<br/>
and in gathering up the Saints the middle months in<br/>
our journey homeward and the latter end of the year<br/>
in the necessary business of daily life and preparing<br/>
for Winter and in a Ministerial and public capacity.</p>

<p>Patriarchal Blessing<br/>
of<br/>
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruf]]</p>

<p>Given by Patriarch [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] upon his head<br/>
December the 20th 1850</p>

<p>Brother Aphek:<br/>
Beloved of the Lord—I lay<br/>
my hands upon thy head in the order of the Priesthood and<br/>
notwithstanding thy great age I seal upon thee a father's<br/>
blessing.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as thou has obeyed the</p>",
42658.0,399,,"<p>Gospel with full purpose of heart left thy native land disregarding<br/>
persecution thou hast passed through many trials and difficulties<br/>
thy faith hath not failed, thou art determined to persevere<br/>
in the ways of truth and righteousness and thy name is<br/>
written in the Lamb's Book of Life and is not to be blotted<br/>
out.</p>

<p>The Lord will grant unto thee everything<br/>
which your heart desires for thou art a lawful heir to<br/>
the Priesthood of the blood of [[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]] which Priesthood<br/>
shall be confered upon you in its fulness in due time<br/>
Thou shalt have power to heal the sick in thine house<br/>
and do any miracle that was ever done by man in<br/>
the name of Jesus when it is necessary for the salvation<br/>
of Israel.</p>

<p>Thy posterity shall become numerous<br/>
upon the earth and shall fill a station in the house<br/>
of [[Israel|Israel]] which shall endure unto the end of time</p>

<p>The days of your years shall be<br/>
according to the desire of your heart even to see Israel<br/>
gathered and Zion established in peace in the earth.</p>

<p>Thou shalt have health peace and<br/>
plenty while you dwell in the flesh. Thou art called<br/>
to do much good in instructing the Saints even to preach<br/>
the Gospel not only while you live but beyond the veil, shalt<br/>
gather thousands of the remenants of the house of Israel and<br/>
bring them to a knowledge of the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p>Thou shalt live many years and see<br/>
much good accomplished among the Saints, be satisfied with<br/>
life come up in the resurrection with thy former companions<br/>
and all thy father's house to inherit a kingdom which<br/>
shall endure for ever and ever: Amen.</p>

<p>Our Sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Sarah B. Foss]] and her family<br/>
also received their Blessings at the same time. Myself</p>",
42658.0,400,,"<p>and wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]] had both, (she in 1836 and I in 1837)<br/>
received our blessings under the hands of [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith sen.]]<br/>
father of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph the Prophet]] and First Patriarch in this Dispensation<br/>
presiding in that office. These Patriarchal Blessings of<br/>
myself and wife Phebe W. will be found recorded in the earlier<br/>
part of my histroy and they were now recorded together with<br/>
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] and wife's [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|sister]] and family into the Church records<br/>
of Patriarch [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] who at this time also blessed<br/>
my wife Phebe W.</p>

<p>Before commencing to bless, Father<br/>
John Smith made some remarks upon the subject. He said<br/>
he considered the mark spoken of by [[Ezekiel (OT)|Ezekiel]] set in the<br/>
forehead of the righteous by the one having the writers<br/>
ink-horn by his side to be the Patriarchal Blessings and<br/>
seal in the last days and [[John (NT)|John the Revelator]] had the same<br/>
thing in view when he spoke of the one hundred and forty<br/>
and four thousand sealed out of the Twelve tribes of [[Israel (OT)|Israel]]<br/>
He also spoke of the blessings of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] and [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]]<br/>
to their children the Patriarchs.</p>

<p>Thus ended my labours and the events of my<br/>
personal histroy during the year and the Saints in the<br/>
Valleys of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] had been greatly blessed and prospered<br/>
and had been fast building up their cities.</p>",

[[Brigham Young|Young]] spoke upon the subject of swearing or taking the<br/>
name of God in vain. A covenant was thereupon<br/>
made by the whole congregation to put down swearing<br/>

and then the congregation was addressed by Joseph Young<br/>
[[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] and [[George Davis Grant|George Grant]] and then President Brigham<br/>
Young followed.</p>

<p>President Young informed the Saints<br/>
that the time had come to begin to prepare to build a<br/>
Temple and the people must pay their tithing and he requested<br/>
the Presidents of every quorum to take the names of every<br/>
member of their quorum and they should sign a paper and<br/>
covenant to pay their tithing and they who would not do it<br/>
should be cut off from the Church.</p>",
42658.0,405,,""">20th</time> from my trip<br/>
to [[Big Cottonwood Canyon, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Cottonwood]] and elsewhere I learned that some brethren had<br/>
arrived from [[California|California]] bringing a mail with them bearing<br/>
the <u>news that Brigham Young was</u><br/>
<u>Appointed our Governor</u>.</p>",
42658.0,406,,""">2nd of Feb.</time> the congregation<br/>
met in the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and Mr [[Samuel Bateman|Bateman]] requested the privelege<br/>
of addressing the meeting in behalf of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] the Prophet whom<br/>
he said was in the city.</p>

<p>President Young made some remarks<br/>
before he spoke and then Bateman addressed the meeting<br/>
nine minutes.</p>

<p>President Young followed and said:<br/>
""We have heard what Bateman had to say but he has<br/>
brought forth nothing.</p>

<p>""Many have arisen in these last days<br/>
professing to be Elijah the Prophet but they have brought<br/>
forth nothing of interest to the people.</p>

<p>Will any one tell me what the office<br/>
of Elijah the Prophet was to be to the earth when he came<br/>
The answer is to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers<br/>
and the fathers to their children lest I come and smite the ^whole^ earth<br/>
with a curse. The answer is right. In what way is this<br/>
to be done? By sealing upon the head of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
those keys to remain in the Church and Kingdom of God<br/>
until the winding up scene.</p>

<p>The Elders of this Church know those</p>",
42658.0,407,,"<p>keys were sealed upon the head of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and still remain in the<br/>
Church. What are they to accomplish? As the Saints could not<br/>
be perfect in former days without the Latter-day Saints neither<br/>
can we be perfect without our fathers who have died for many<br/>
generations and those keys of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] confered upon the President<br/>
of the Church are to seal the fathers to their children and the children<br/>
to the fathers and to assist in welding the great link connecting<br/>
every gospel dispensation.</p>

<p>I see the wheat growing in this dispensation<br/>
ripening for the harvest. I see the tares also growing for the<br/>
burning. I saw too the wheat and tares grow on together:<br/>
I saw the goats and sheep both go ahead unto the end.</p>

<p>The Saints of God are increasing in<br/>
knowledge fast but they have got to be a hundred times better,<br/>
wiser and advance in knowledge before the end.</p>

<p>I have watched the windings and progress<br/>
of this people and the Spirits that surround them. I have seen<br/>
many rise as it were to heaven and in a moment of temptation<br/>
fall down to hell and loose their hopes of Glory. I know the<br/>
spirits of men and the invisible spirits that affect men and operate<br/>
upon them better than I do the faces of men.</p>

<p>I want to speak a little upon natural<br/>
philosophy. We sow the grain. It dies—rots in the ground<br/>
and then it brings forth a hundred fold. The elements which<br/>
surround us produce these effects. If we had a correct knowledge<br/>
of the elements and know how to control and seperate them we<br/>
could make bread as well out of the elements as Jesus did<br/>
when he fed the multitude. The day will come when<br/>
we can go a journey without taking any food with us. We<br/>

 to transact business for the<br/>
State.

<p>An ordinance was passed granting to the<br/>
community a liberal charter protecting them in their religious<br/>
rights.</p>

<p>During the passage of this ordiance the<br/>
[[Brigham Young|governor]] said ""We do not want the Church to pass laws to</p>",
42658.0,409,,"<p>punish crime but only to try members on Church fellowship. If the<br/>
members shall transgress the laws of the land turn them over to the <br/>
laws of the land; but we want to protect the Church in their rights of<br/>
worship and so we will every other sect that comes here.</p>

<p>When the Kingdoms of this world become the<br/>
Kingdoms of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will they all be<br/>
members of the Church of Jesus Christ and obey the Gospel?<br/>
No not one eighth part of them. No more than a telestial<br/>
kingdom is a celestial one and they stand in about the same<br/>
relation one to the other.</p>

<p>If a society of Shaking quakers were to<br/>
come here and settle in this Valley and wanted a charter to be<br/>
protected in their worship let us give them one and if they<br/>
think it right not to marry a woman let them live without<br/>
it and not compel them to it.</p>

<p>So if the Latter-day Saints wish to have<br/>
more wives than one to live holy and raise up holy seed unto <br/>
the Lord let them enjoy that privilege.</p>

<p>Now the Gentile Christian nations<br/>
and Legislatures guard very stricly against putting any law<br/>
to do away with whoredoms but they will make it almost<br/>
death for a man to have two wives but they will have as<br/>
many whores as they please and they think this is all right<br/>
but for a righteous man to have several wives like [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]]<br/>
[[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] and [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]] [[David (OT)|David]] and others to raise up holy seed unto<br/>
the Lord who will keep themselves pure before God they think<br/>
this is an awful sin. But if [[Brigham Young|I]] had power I would take<br/>
all good virtuous females from all wicked corrupt adulterous<br/>
husbands and give them to holy men of God that they may<br/>
raise up seed unto the Lord.</p>

<p>I have more wives than one. I have<br/>
many and I am not ashamed to have it known. Some<br/>

 President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and many others<br/>
left the city to visit the bretheren South, I wote to Bro [[Thomas Kington|Kington]]<br/>
and spent the night with him; and next day prepared myself <br/>
to go on the journey with [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]]. He came along<br/>
in the morning and I went with him to [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoots]] and<br/>
joined Presidents Young and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and we started on our <br/>
journey.

<p>We had in our company 20 waggons<br/>
and about 40 men in our visiting trip 250 miles to our Southern<br/>
brethren <strike>and</strike> to comfort their hearts. I thought there were. was <br/>
a company of the same members who ever left as much<br/>
bsuiness to get on a visit as we did.</p>

<p>An Account of our Journey South.</p>

<p>After we left brother Smoots we crossed the<br/>
mountain into [[Utah Valley, Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah Valley]] and camped for the night. This<br/>
was the first time I ever was in Utah Valley. I found it<br/>
to be a spendid Valley of land.</p>

<p>The company went on in the morning<br/>
and I rode to the Fort on the South West side of the [[Utah Lake, Utah County, Utah Territory|Lake]]<br/>
dined with some friends on some fine trout and then rode<br/>
to our encampment on the [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]] Fort.</p>

<p>Next day I rode to Brother [[Isaac Behannan|Behannan]]<br/>
and spent several hours with him at [[Hobble Creek, Utah County, Utah Territory|Hobble Creek]]. I here<br/>
found [[Chief Walker|Walker]] the Utah Chief with his band. This was the <br/>
first time I ever saw him. I thought him an ugly<br/>
cunning looking chief. </p>",
42658.0,413,,"<p>Next day I rode with Brother [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] across the battle<br/>
ground where the Indians fought our bretheren with Brother Well<strike>s</strike> as<br/>
the leader of the Saints. He gave me an interesting account of<br/>
the battle.</p>

<p>We rode to Peletinck Creek where we met<br/>
the or teams who were appointed to go to [[Beaver Valley, Iron County, Utah Territory|Iron County]]. We travelled<br/>
to [[Summit Creek, Woodland Hills, Utah County, Utah Territory|Summit Creek]] and camped for the night.</p>

<p>In the evening a meeting was called to <br/>
organize the Camp. Brother Wells was our captain<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] President and [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] W. Woodruff<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. <strike>Benes</strike> Benson]] and [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] Councillors.</p>

<p>President Young while speaking of the <br/>
ressurection said that we should receive the same bodies that <br/>
we lay down even if our chest was blown to the fourwinds<br/>
of heaven.</p>

<p>When we came in sight of [[Sanpete County, Utah Territory|San Pete]]<br/>
Settlement three days later we were saluted by the fireing <br/>
of cannon and waving of flags. We were receieved with<br/>
much warmth by Father [[Isaac Morley|Morely]] and the people in general<br/>
There were at this time about one hundred families in<br/>
San Pete. They were farming had a school house <br/>
and had commenced a Council House Etc.</p>

<p>I called upon Brother Brown Captain<br/>
[[Dan Jones|Jones]] and other friends.</p>

<p>We held a meeting in the evening and<br/>
Brigham Young addressed the people. <strike>His belief</strike>  ^It was his belief^ that <br/>
the earth would not have produced for the Gentiles as it<br/>
had done for us and if we had faith and power with God<br/>

 we left<br/>
Sanpete in the afternoon travelled 10 miles and camped on<br/>
South Creek and next evening we camped on [[Salt Creek Canyon, Utah Territory|Salt Creek<br/>
Kanyon]] and on the morrow we went three miles up the<br/>
Creek to explore it. We visited one mountain of rock<br/>
salt pure and clean and the body was more than 40-<br/>
feet high and so hard it was difficult to cut it with an<br/>
axe. We also saw plenty of the quartz rock and<br/>
issinglass. We rode to the [[Sevier River, Utah|Severe]] and camped<br/>
on its banks and shot one deer while it was swimming <br/>
the Creek.

<p>Sunday we crossed the Severe rode <br/>
25 miles through sage and camped on Cottonwood <strike>wells</strike> ^[[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Bro Wells]]^<br/>
<strike>and</strike> explored the other Kanyon but could not get through.</p>

<p>Next day we crossed the mountain into<br/>
[[Marysvale, Piute County, Utah Territory|MaryVale]] and three days later travel <strike>and</strike> ^with^ a pleasant morning<br/>
brought us into a beautiful romantic mountain scenery<br/>
a gentle breeze and the air clear serene and healthy.</p>

<p>But next moring we were met<br/>
with a tremendious snow and hail storm in our faces<br/>
and we suffered much therefrom. We started early </p>",
42658.0,415,,"<p>before breakfast hoping to get down off the mountain out of the storm,<br/>
and travelled 25 miles before we stoped to eat. We came in sight of<br/>
the Valley of [[Little Salt Lake Valley, Iron County, Utah Territory|Little Salt Lake]] about noon drove down into a<br/>
Canyon made a fire warmed ourselves took dinner and there<br/>
descended into the Valley over a rough road of rock and sage<br/>
drove to [[Red Creek, Iron County, Utah Territory|Red Creek]] and camped for the night.</p>

<p>We had pressed over the worse road for the<br/>
few days past that I ever knew waggons to go over for we had<br/>
to draw our waggons up and let them down with ropes the<br/>
road was so sideling and we had to hold our waggons up to<br/>
keep them from turning over.</p>

<p>We camped within 4 miles of [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Ceder City]]<br/>
and during the evening [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and two other brethren<br/>
come down to see us. We found Red Creek a good<br/>
place for a settlement.</p>

<p>We took breakfast next morning and then<br/>
started for Ceder City and we were met on the way by George<br/>
A. Smith and a company of horsement who came out to <br/>
escort us in. When we arrived we were saluted by the<br/>
fireing of cannon and the flag of the Stars and Stripes<br/>
We took up our abode among the brethren in the Fort<br/>
Brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] and myself stoped with Bishop [[Joseph L. Robinson|Robinson]].</p>

<p>We found the brethren had done much<br/>
since their arrival in Ceder Valley. They were about 100<br/>
men had been there ^three^ months had enclosed a fort containing<br/>
19 acres and 96 rods of ground ploughed and sown about<br/>
1000 acres with wheat fenced 600 acres of land built a<br/>
saw mill and had got a Council House up the first story.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday but as it was<br/>
a stormy day George A. Smith addressed the people for a short<br/>
time and dismissed them.</p>

<p>A company started out on the Monday<br/>
to examine the coal and iron but the [[Brigham Young|President]] and</p>",
42658.0,416,,"<p>council remained in Fort to hold a council meeting and do such business <br/>
as was necessary.</p>

<p>A meeting was called at 11 o'clock to ascertain the<br/>
minds of the brethren. It was found that about 30 wished to go<br/>
home 15 to get their families and the other 15 to remain at<br/>
[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]]. Each one made his excuse.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] then addressed them and <br/>
said he would express his feelings upon the subject to those who<br/>
wished to go home.</p>

<p>""If you were now on a mission to [[France|France]]<br/>
[[England|England]] or any other part of the earth preaching the Gospel<br/>
you could not sit down and counsel together about going<br/>
to get your families or going home until your mission was <br/>
ended. This is of quite as much importance as preaching<br/>
the gospel for the time has now come when it is required of<br/>
us to make the wilderness blossom as the rose. Our mission<br/>
is now to build up stakes of Zion and fill these [[Rocky Mountains, United States|mountains]]<br/>
with cities and when your mission is ended you are at<br/>
liberty to go and be free but only do right.</p>

<p>""When I go on a mission I leave my <br/>
affairs in the hands of God. If my house fields flocks<br/>
wife or children die in my absense I say Amen to it;<br/>
if they live and prosper I feel to say Amen to it and thank<br/>
the Lord""</p>

<p>President Young wished the brethren<br/>
to finish the fort and secure the grain &amp;c, and to survey<br/>
the land so that the brethren who laid the foundation<br/>
could have the choice of farms.</p>

<p>On the morrow the brethren assembled<br/>
again and [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] addressed them in the morning<br/>
and in the afternoon the people were addressed by<br/>
[[John Young Jr.|John Young]] [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] and W. Woodruff and then<br/>
President Young followed and advised to have the logs</p>",
42658.0,417,,"<p>so close that arrows could not be shot into the Fort. [[Brigham Young|He]] wished the<br/>
boundries of the city to be altered on the charter as there was a mistake,<br/>
also that the name was to be altered from [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Cedar city]] to the indian<br/>
name [[Parowan, Iron County, Utah Territory|Parowan]].</p>

<p>Next day we rode to [[Red Creek, Iron County, Utah Territory|Red Creek]] to see<br/>
the country. We had a feast at Brother [[G. W. Bayliss|Baylis]] house and our<br/>
exploring party returned from the coal and iron mines and brought<br/>
specimen and on the following day we rode to Summit <br/>
Creek where we could view the country 10 miles from the<br/>
Fort South. He concluded to return home on the morrow.</p>

<p>On the 16th the day on which we had concluded<br/>
to return we met the citizens to agree upon electing officers<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said he cared nothing about the feelings of the<br/>
nation who had driven us out. We should not follow in the <br/>
path of the political foolery. We should have one candidate<br/>
and but one as delegate to Congress. We can speak our<br/>
feelings freely here but when we vote let it be for the<br/>
candidate of our choice. Should we have two candidates<br/>
and they have about equal votes the United States would know<br/>
we had a<strike>p</strike>postatized from our faith and union or that we<br/>
were trying to decieve them. We shall stand better in their<br/>
eyes to take our own indipendant course and act unitedly. <br/>
If we have had one track the Saints will walk on it: if<br/>
we had two tracks there would be plenty of devils to run<br/>
on them. If we begin right we shall go right <strike>we</strike><br/>
<strike>shall go right</strike> if we begin wrong we shall go wrong<br/>
The United States are afraid of our union and so<br/>
is all the world.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Indians he said<br/>
these Indians are the descendants of the old Gadianton<br/>
robbers who infested the mountains for more than<br/>
a thousand years.</p>

<p>We dined together in the city of</p>",
42658.0,418,,"<p>[[Parowan, Iron County, Utah Territory|Parowan]] and then left amid the roar of cannon and drove to [[Red Creek, Iron County, Utah Territory|Red<br/>
Creek]] and camped for the night. About 30 of the citizens returned<br/>
with us for [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]].</p>

<p>On the 24th we arrived at Great Salt Lake<br/>
City. One hundred horsemen came out to meet us and we<br/>
entered the city with the roar of cannon saluting our return<br/>
Our journey had been 500 miles.</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday. The people<br/>
assembled in the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and filled the place and President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
addressed the assembly relating our journey over the <br/>
mountains.</p>

<p>The following was deliverd on the next Sunday</p>

<p>Synopsis of A Discourse<br/>
by<br/>
President <strike>Yo</strike> Young<br/>
Delivered June 1st 1851</p>

<p>If a man does right he shall have the Spirit of God to<br/>
enlighten his mind in all things; yet all men will be<br/>
tried buffeted and tempted more or less in this probation and<br/>
he that governs himself is wise. If a man is unrighteously<br/>
angry he should let it sleep and not show itself until<br/>
he is himself again.</p>

<p>A good man may be left to commit<br/>
a gross sin but if he had watched closely he would have escaped <br/>
the evil. The Lord intended for all men to be<br/>
tried in this life and if you build your faith upon a true<br/>
foundation that faith has to be tried.</p>

<p>All men have an apportunity of<br/>
appearing wise or foolish of governing themselves or<br/>
making their folly manifest.</p>

<p>[[Peter (NT)|Peter]] committed a gross error. Had</p>",
42658.0,419,,"<p>[[Peter (NT)|he]] been in the watchtower he might have turned away in the silence<br/>
and not denied his Lord.</p>

<p>Many have been tried and turned away from<br/>
us at a time when they expected to have gained something by it<br/>
and in doing so they have lost all. Others have been blinded and<br/>
overcome and done evil then their eyes were open to see the <br/>
consequences.</p>

<p>But if it is the privilege of all men to live<br/>
so that they can see what each act will amount to either good<br/>
or evil how different the prospect would be <strike>before</strike> of the world<br/>
<strike>of</strike> or even this people if they would live so from what it now<br/>
is.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] endevour to do right in all things and then leave<br/>
the event in the hands of God and am satisfied with the result<br/>
If a man is led or tempted to do a thing therof you do not <br/>
comprenhend the result of and that result not lead to good <br/>
then let it alone.</p>

<p>During the past week one remarked to<br/>
me that my observation of last Sunday ought to be made and was<br/>
good but it ought to have been spoken in the right spirit. But<br/>
I wish to say that I am satisfied with the power and influence<br/>
the Lord has given me. The Lord directs things according <br/>
to his ^own^ will.</p>

<p>I know my feelings and zeal would<br/>
make my words like a sharp two edged sword so that<br/>
they could seperate the sins from the people that they<br/>
should practise sin no more not to be tempted with<br/>
it; but this is not the will of God. The people still<br/>
must have their warefare and trial and if the storms<br/>
and waves overwhelm the ship still all is well for we<br/>
have a good captain at the helm.</p>

<p>Some people are very anxious to<br/>
reprove others while they are wrong themselves and do</p>",
42658.0,420,,"<p>not know the spirit they are of. They are ready to say, ""How do you<br/>
do [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] and [[Judas (NT)|Judas]]; Jesus and how do you do Mr. Devil and are<br/>
very pious and will go to hell and the whole world will go to hell<br/>
with the same spirit.</p>

<p>Awake ye Elders of Israel and make<br/>
your calling election, sure lest you go to hell with the<br/>
wicked. [[Brigham Young|I]] do not point you to the Sectarian hell<br/>
where devils are tossing you with a pitchfork, in the billows<br/>
of hell fire eternally; but go and mingle with the wicked in<br/>
the States wrangle &amp; fight with them get their spirit and<br/>
feelings and loose the light and spirit of God and you will<br/>
begin to feel the true state of the damned.</p>

<p>The wicked killed Jesus Christ out<br/>
of malice and wickedness and they did not know that<br/>
his death was to save the world. The Lord turns<br/>
many things for good which the world means for<br/>
evil.</p>

<p>The whole earth is filled with <br/>
misery sin and wickedness. I could find no worse<br/>
hell than to be confined among them. I labour for<br/>
the welfare of the whole people. I wish my bretheren<br/>
to be a happy free people that their course of life may<br/>
be such as to get an eternal and temporal salvation<br/>
I labour to effect this.</p>

<p>There is time and change to all things<br/>
There has been a code of laws given in former days<br/>
which was for all people—namely the Gospel of Jesus<br/>
Christ. In the days of Christ the Apostles<br/>
and Elders were sent out to preach the gospel and warn<br/>
the people. They did so but were then martyred <br/>
for preaching it and the Saints were killed off<br/>
the earth.</p>

<p>That time is gone. The change</p>",
42658.0,421,,"<p>has come; for now the set time has come to favour Zion to build<br/>
it up in strength power and glory — to gather Israel to build Jerusalem<br/>
and Zion to fight for our freedom and liberty.</p>

<p>We have sent the Gospel forth and preached<br/>
the Book of Mormon and the ministry of Jesus on this continent<br/>
in ancient days. Now the time is come to gather Israel<br/>
and polish them.</p>

<p>There is a great excitment in the world<br/>
about slavery; and the Abolitionists are fearful that we shall <br/>
have the Negro or the Indian as Slaves here. We have a few<br/>
who were prisoners whom we have bought to save their <br/>
lives. But what will the Abolitionists do? If you owe them<br/>
a dollar they will jug you up. Neither will they liberate the<br/>
Slave by buying them and setting them free. The master of <br/>
Slaves will be damned if they abuse their slaves yet the seed<br/>
of [[Ham (OT)|Ham]] will be servents until god takes the curse off<br/>
from them.</p>

<p>But they are not all the slaves who are <br/>
in the world. The whole world are slaves to sin and<br/>
wickedness and passion.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] have two blacks. They are as free<br/>
as I am. Shall we lay a foundation for Negro slavery?<br/>
As God forbid; and I forbid. I say let us be free. We will<br/>
be rich but we must be rich in faith first or we shall be<br/>
rich in no other way.</p>

<p>We must lay a foundation to manufacture<br/>
our own goods. If we do not we shall be slaves to our<br/>
enemies. We must stop living so dependent upon<br/>
our enemies and foreign markerts or it will make us<br/>
trouble. And this people must cease getting into<br/>
debt to the merchants for if you will get into debt you<br/>
shall pay your debts. But I say stop getting into<br/>
debt. Let no one come to me and complain that</p>",
42658.0,422,,"<p>he has got in debt and that the man will sue him and ought to <br/>
be cut off from the Church for you who get into debt and<br/>
wont pay your debts are the ones who ought to be cut off from<br/>
the Church.</p>

<p>Don't get into debt. Go in the Spring <br/>
and get the bark off the shrub oaks. There is enough in<br/>
this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] to tan two hundred thousand dollars worth of <br/>
leather; and here your hides are rolling over the earth and<br/>
you are paying 50 cents per pound for leather and you<br/>
pay the merchants 80 thousand annually for shoes.<br/>
Instead of persuing this course if you will lay a foundation<br/>
for taning leather making cloth and what we want you will<br/>
be laying a foundation to build and sustain Zion.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] drove sheep to this valley and<br/>
brought others and brought a carding machine here to<br/>
card wool. Who ^will^ put it up? I have done more to<br/>
stock this valley than any to man in the place<br/>
I want others to do something. Set up the machinery<br/>
and make the cloth.</p>

<p>Is there any woman in this Valley<br/>
who will make me a suit of clothes? See if I do not wear<br/>
them. What is the spirit of the times in the world?<br/>
If a woman pays a great price for an article it is considered<br/>
very nice and all want some of the same; but you<br/>
get a thing cheep and all are ashamed to wear it— you<br/>
are looked upon with disdain if you do; but if you<br/>
pay a great price you are very respectable</p>

<p>There are many practices not right<br/>
To see men ride through the street; they go as though<br/>
they were in a hurry to get to hell. To men of <br/>
wisdom such things look vain and foolish but to<br/>
the world it look glorious and the mark of fellowship<br/>
with them is fine clothing and splendor.</p>",

<p>""I want to speak such things as are in my heart. All<br/>
that are acquainted with me know that my religion embraces<br/>
all things that belong to the duties of life</p>",
42658.0,424,,"<p>The religion [[Brigham Young|I]] have, embraced all the principles of<br/>
present future progressive and eternal salvation in every sense of the word<br/>
I labour for the salvation of myself and my brethren. I would be glad<br/>
to speak to thousands even to the whole world if they could hear. I<br/>
would not like to preach in this house to 20 or a hundred persons when<br/>
more than 1000 could get in here and then for 20 or a hundred more<br/>
to come and to have to preach from 20 to 50 times to have the people<br/>
learn when they could learn all together.</p>

<p>The [[John Van Cott|President]] of the Seventies called a seperate <br/>
meeting to day. I came and dismissed it. What if the Twelve<br/>
Seventies High Priests Elders Priests Teachers Deacons and Members<br/>
should do the same? There would be bare walls or the house to<br/>
preach to; and what good would it do? If the Presidency of the <br/>
Seventies have such important things to lay before the quorums <br/>
to get them together on Sunday let them come and teach us<br/>
all.</p>

<p>I now want to give counsel in this matter<br/>
from this time forth and forever; Let not the President of<br/>
any quorum ever again call a seperate meeting from the public<br/>
congregation unless the President of the church order it.</p>

<p>The Seventies should be here and all<br/>
the people should be here. Let the [[Seventies Hall, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Seventies Hall]] go and<br/>
all other business when Sunday comes. Let the Seventy of God<br/>
come together and hear the Elders teach. Apply your hearts<br/>
with wisdom and get it. If I am full of the Spirit I<br/>
shall not get any more than I shall want. It is the duty<br/>
of all to come here who can come and let The power of eternity<br/>
rest upon us and you should not be asleep but wide<br/>
awake.</p>

<p>When I contrast the present with the past<br/>
situation of the Saints it gives me a great variety of feelings<br/>
both good and bad joyful and sorowful.</p>

<p>I have seen this people waiding through</p>",
42658.0,425,,"<p>a school of afflictions. They then were prayerful and had faith. Their<br/>
trying situation made them remember the Lord their God; but now<br/>
prosperity is heaped upon you and as this people are to be tried in all<br/>
things: when prosperity comes some forget God was fat and wide and<br/>
do not realize the blessings they are enjoying.</p>

<p>Some who are in poverty abroad desire to <br/>
gather with the Saints. When they arrive and get rich they forget<br/>
what they have been. Could you see the feelings of thousands <br/>
who are abroad who desire with all their hearts to come here they would<br/>
be willing to lick up the dust of your feet if they could be here<br/>
They are still with the wicked. Bring them here. They look<br/>
upon many who were poor but now rich. They then desire<br/>
to be rich also. They want gold and will soon be willing<br/>
to sacrifice the society of the Saints and go to the Gold mines<br/>
and plunge themselves again into hell as it were from whence<br/>
they come to gratify an unlawful desire.</p>

<p>Thus it is with many men. Some<br/>
want to go to the [[Platte River, Nebraska Territory|Platte]], to [[Bear River, Cache County, Utah Territory|Bear River]], to keep a ferry<br/>
to get gold and wait on wicked ungodly men. Were are their<br/>

wait on the devils for loads of gold. I would rather stay<br/>
here and serve the Lord All I want of property <br/>
is to serve the Lord and build up his kingdom with it.</p>

<p>I suppose many of the bretheren and<br/>

want. I will tell you what ^to^ you <strike>do</strike>. Do<br/>
all you can to day and let the rest go till tomorrow<br/>
Do your duty to day and all will be right.</p>

<p>What good would it do you to<br/>
have 999 years to search and learn the revelations and commandments<br/>
of God if we have no time to carry out one of them<br/>
If any men want to get more revelation than they <br/>
can improve upon they are greedy dogs.</p>",

has revealed through the mouth of his servant [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], which<br/>
he laid out for us to perform before his death, even during<br/>
the last year of his life to say nothing of what he gave<br/>
before.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] will tell you your duty. Command<br/>
your minds from everything that is not for you to-day<br/>
and sit and worship God not sit and sleep. Worship the<br/>
Lord to-day. Go home at the close of the meeting and<br/>
get your food and rest, then come to meeting again<br/>
ponder and reflect upon the course of the Lord Jesus <br/>
Christ and his sufferings. If there is anything<br/>
necessary to be done do it and if an ox or an ass<br/>

<p>Do you meditate? Do you<br/>
pray in your families, and in secret to get the Spirit<br/>
of God?</p>

<p>You say you have your trials? I<br/>
have mine. I will tell some of them. Brethren<br/>
will come here to meeting; on Monday morning go<br/>
through my field leaving my fence down and let their<br/>
cattle and horses eat my wheat, borrow my cart waggon<br/>

my duty to stay here I would lay my hands upon<br/>
some I could pick out whom I have confidence in<br/>

not admit of any person who was not proven.</p>

<p>I would like to say enough in few words to fill<br/>
three sermons. I have to deliver my discourses<br/>
in few words.</p>",
42658.0,428,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] wish the people to sustain the Priesthood as<br/>
the Priesthood. As to the opinion of man concerning myself<br/>
as a man I care no more about than I do the dust under my<br/>
feet. I dont care what you say about me, if you<br/>
will only serve the Lord our God.</p>

<p>Do this people live so as to know<br/>
the voice of the Good Shepherd? I wish to state one<br/>
item here which concerns you seriously. That is concering<br/>
the Indians here. They are ignorant have been taught<br/>
to steal and kill from their childhood and those who could<br/>
do the most of it were considered the greatest Braves and<br/>
Chiefs. As soon as they begin to steal here<br/>
many of you want them killed and compare their <br/>
circumstance with your own. You are taught<br/>
from your cradle not to steal or kill as it is a great<br/>
crime. Now do you kill a white as soon as <br/>
he steals? Weigh the subject well.</p>

<p>Those who wish them killed for stealing<br/>
a horse reduce themsevles far below the Indian. You love<br/>
them as well as I do but when the curse is taken off they<br/>
will again be fit for society; but while they are in their<br/>
dependant state it rests with as to use wisdom and judgement<br/>
in their behalf.</p>

<p>I say to the saints kill every white<br/>
man you see stealing and not kill the Indian for it for<br/>
the white man know better.</p>

<p>I speak to the Saints not as Governer <br/>
of Utah; but you and I are sent to save Israel not <br/>
to kill them.</p>

<p>Every Elder that crosses a certain<br/>
line I do not wish to see him; but those who do<br/>
right or seek to do right if they commit an error<br/>
we will forgive them. </p>",
42658.0,429,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] do not ask for influence only what God gives<br/>
me; neither will I give any man influence only what the <br/>
Lord and his own good conduct gives him; for if God does<br/>
not give a man influence all else will be of no use to him.</p>

<p>If I do the work of God all is well but<br/>
I will give no man influence only what God gives.</p>

<p>A few words to families who have not a <br/>
head to govern. They will be destroyed. The man is the <br/>
head of the family and should govern it. The hand may say<br/>
to the head if I really thought you would govern right I would<br/>
be governed by you; but I am afriad you will not; and<br/>
I want to govern you and dictate the head. Then the<br/>
shoulders and stomach will want to dictate. But does<br/>
not good sense tell you that your head should govern<br/>
your body? Your experience teaches the same<br/>
Your head didctates you what to do and when your head<br/>
dictates your body wickedly and polutes the body then<br/>
the head should be cut off so das not to polute the<br/>
body any longer.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] remarked that<br/>
there w<strike>as</strike>ere some bodies who could not act unless the belly<br/>
told the head what to do. <strike>In the strict sense of<br/>
the word</strike></p>

<p>In the strick sense of the word no man<br/>
is quallified to judge and rule until he is qualified to rule<br/>
himself and he king over himself.</p>

<p>It is thus in families. Children<br/>
and mothers have you a good husband and father?<br/>
Let the wife rule the husband and she will keep him<br/>
tied to the dish cloth and kitchen all the days of<br/>
his life and it proves a curse upon him</p>

<p>There is a curse upon man that I<br/>
would not take off if I could for in the experience<br/>
you have you are led to salvation through our Lord</p>",
42658.0,430,,"<p>Jesus Christ</p>

<p>Do you know your calling matters? It is<br/>
your duty to brace up your feelings as men have to do and be<br/>
mistresses of your house.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] go to the house to rest. The mother<br/>
says I cannot govern the children; I wish you would; but<br/>
this is not right. The Elders of this Church have to go<br/>
abroad to preach the gospel. They cannot be with thier <br/>
children. When they come home to spend a little<br/>
time they want to dandle their children upon their knee<br/>
and not go to whipping them.</p>

<p>The mothers should govern them<br/>
until the sons go with their fathers into the field. Then<br/>
let the fathers govern. I can govern my children<br/>
when they are with me. I would rather one of my<br/>
sons to stab me to the heart and kill me dead than<br/>
conquer and master me.</p>

<p>In government when any undertake <br/>
to govern out of their place they do not prosper <br/>
As an example; [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] undertake<br/>
to govern and control and set right my affairs at <br/>
[[Council House, Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] while I was on a pioneer journey<br/>
to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] and they were likely to have destroyed<br/>
many; but I said Peace be still and I saved<br/>
the people.</p>

<p>I say to mothers in the name <br/>
of the Lord God of Israel do your duty. Dont ask<br/>
the Father to whip the child. Do it yourself if <br/>
necessary and let the mothers control their daughters<br/>
until they go to their husbands.</p>

<p>But let the man rule and<br/>
preside over his household. And I say to the<br/>
men do not go home and abuse wives because</p>",

<p>If I can see the motives of the heart of man<br/>
and know eternal things by the Spirit of God it is far<br/>
more beautiful than to hear the words of men</p>

<p>Should an angel come and converse<br/>
with any man in the congregation no other one might<br/>
know it. He would think the person spoke to<br/>
him as one speaks to another face to face when the<br/>
angel would not be seen at all only by the Spirit of<br/>
God or by vision.</p>

<p>We may know by the Spirit of God<br/>
what is in a mans heart before he speaks. At<br/>
all times listen to the still small voice of the Spirit<br/>
of God and it will save the Saints from many<br/>
snares.</p>

<p>If you get angry dont sin nor let<br/>
the s<strike>i</strike>un go down upon your wrath. I do not<br/>
expect to see perfection in man, not what the<br/>
world calls perfection. I have seen a perfect<br/>
Peophet and perfect Apostles: that is perfect in</p>",
42658.0,432,,"<p>their calling; but not the perfection the world looks for. If [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
had been as perfect as the people wished him to be he could<br/>
not have lived with the people nor stayed this side of<br/>
the veil as long as he did. We could not have heard his <br/>
voice nor have seen his face: he would have been veiled.<br/>
Israel could not endure the face of [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] at times.</p>

<p>The Lord expects us to be in the<br/>
path of duty. When we get in eternity we shall be<br/>
angels or Gods. We shall there advance to the Godhead<br/>
if we do right.</p>

<p>In speaking of the law, what a <br/>
simple thing it is? What is the law to those who<br/>
do right? It is not made for anybody but the<br/>
transgresser and the lawless and wicked. If we do<br/>
not infringe upon the rights of others all things are ours<br/>
in heaven and earth, time and eternity; life and death<br/>
because earth and hell and all that is therein is ours.<br/>
If we do not infringe upon the rights of any other being<br/>
we shall become Gods and fill immensity as our<br/>
Father in Heaven does.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] can weigh all the <strike>sleepers</strike> philosophers<br/>
and learned men of the earth in a scale and know just what<br/>
they weigh and can circumscribe them all.</p>

<p>All is mine: heaven earth and hell, —<br/>
wives, children; and I am Christ's and Christ is God's.</p>

<p>It is not known to us where the<br/>
stakes are set to God's immensity. Take the world<br/>
at large. Can they get to the end of their chain when<br/>
they get to the mill pond?</p>

<p>It is a startling idea ^to think^ that we are<br/>
worshiping a God who was once in the situation that we<br/>
are in ourselves. They had to pass through a<br/>
probation of pain suffering and the fall like ourselves</p>",
42658.0,433,,"<p>and be made perfect through suffering. The Son of God passed<br/>
through it and the Father would not require of a Son what he would<br/>
not do himself.</p>

<p>All our sufferings will exalt us in the presence<br/>
of God if we endure them patiently.</p>

<p>A word of advice concering leaving. [[Brigham Young|I]] <br/>
never want to hear of another law-suit among the bretheren.<br/>
Is it anything but good common sense to never have another<br/>
suit before a Judge to say nothing of revelation? It does not<br/>
require any great perfection to accomplish this. Let men do<br/>
right. Do your neighbour good not evil.</p>

<p>The Lord will burn up the earth and<br/>
clense it as you would an old pipe.</p>

<p>You think it hard to have to water your<br/>
land here but it is far more healthy than to have rain. It <br/>
was so in [[Egypt|Egypt]]. If It did not rain more in [[Illinois|Illinois]] and<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] that it does here it would be far more healthy <br/>
there. This could be reasoned upon natural principles.</p>

<p>A word more upon lawsuits. There <br/>
would not be a lawsuit in this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] if all men would<br/>
do right and were Saints; but the net has gathered all<br/>
kinds good bad and worse. Let twelve men get<br/>
drunk in this community and it ruins the place in the<br/>
estimation of good men. We have to bear the character<br/>
of drunkness and a few stinking fish in the net defile<br/>
it and the whole net stinks and it creates a prejudice<br/>
against it.</p>

<p>Those who were acquainted with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
know that if he dealt any in temporal things it created<br/>
a prejudice against him. He bought many goods<br/>
to help carry on the public works but the people<br/>
were ready to get it all away from him. So it<br/>
is now but I say unto all men who are Saints</p>",

<p>I join in testimony with the brethren, I wish to be a doer<br/>
of the word. I feel the importance of the last speaker Brother<br/>
Spencer.</p>

<p>Those who are not ready to meet the Bridegroom<br/>
will not be invited to the supper; and the time is near.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ is an example to all Saints<br/>
He was filled with wisdom in his youth; but in his childhood<br/>
and infancy he was like other children. It has been said that <br/>
he was in infancy wise as in manhood but this is not the case<br/>
He was subject to temptation as we are but was not overcome by<br/>
it.</p>

<p>If we have become acquainted with our follies<br/>
let us put them away and apply our hearts to wisdom. Let <br/>
us have compassion on others as we wish God to have compassion<br/>
on us.</p>

<p>We should increase in wisdom until the day<br/>
of perfection. ^out^ Apply your hearts to wisdom and it will produce<br/>
peace health wealth and every good thing.</p>

<p>Should you see a people carry out<br/>
the principles of wisdom, peace would be the fruit and you would<br/>
never see contention unto the day of your death. Ask the <br/>
world if they do not like a people who live in peace and are</p>",
42658.0,435,,"<p>conte<strike>l</strike>nted and they will say, Yes; it is beautiful.</p>

<p>Take the world of the present <strike>day</strike> time; and they<br/>
are like wolves and eat each other up. They fight and contend<br/>
and devour each other. The [[abolitionists|Abolitionists]] become heated and say<br/>
the [[Negro|negro]] must be made equal to the white man at the table and<br/>
all other places. They will at the same time turn away<br/>
the widow and orphan and put into prison a poor man for debt<br/>
^out^ Instead of this we should feed the hungry and do good to all men<br/>
as we have an opportunity. Then we have a Zion. His <br/>
peace in the heart.</p>

<p>We should bear an evil from a friend as well<br/>
as our enemy. You ask the Lord to bear with your<br/>
infirmities so we should bear with each other.</p>

<p>What is the necessity of doing wrong having <br/>
law suits and contending with each other. Go to law and<br/>
spend $100 to collect $5.</p>

<p>You may be told you are indipendant<br/>
and have rights. You have a right to do good and not evil. The<br/>
God I serve will deal out good to his Saints and everything<br/>
that is necessary for them and reveal his will unto them and<br/>
teach them what to do. He will not lie or deceive me. [[Brigham Young|I]] <br/>
will ask O Lord, did you do this or that? Did you bless<br/>
this man or that man so and so or did you suffer that evil?<br/>
Yes I have done this to try men. Do you want me to do<br/>
so and so?</p>

<p>If I am going to do a thing I ask is it<br/>
the will of God? If I cannot get the will of God upon<br/>
it I refuse to do it lest I do a thing wrong.</p>

<p>We want to do right: then we prosper<br/>
Is the people doing right? Is the Kingdom growing?<br/>
Are there principles in this Kin^g^dom to govern all mankind<br/>
with?</p>

<p>All that the nations of the earth now possess</p>",
42658.0,436,,"<p>would not make this people happy as they now are. Give us<br/>
the Kingdom of God instead of the glories of the world.</p>

<p>There has been a great stir to exalt the<br/>
[[Negro|negro]] and make him equal to the white man but there is a curse<br/>
upon the seed of [[Cain (OT)|Cain]] and all hell cannot wipe it out and it<br/>
cannot be taken off until God takes it off.</p>

<p>When a <strike>A</strike> person unlawfully seeks for power and<br/>
exaltation by taking the blessings which belong to another<br/>
<strike>He</strike> he will sink far below the other. As Lucifer the Son of the<br/>
Morning sought the glory that belong to Christ the First Born<br/>
and was thrust down to hell so Cain sought [[Abel (OT)|Abel's]] blessing<br/>
and took the life of his brother. The consequence was<br/>
Cain was cursed and his seed and this curse will remain<br/>
until Abel's posterity will get all the blessing there is for him<br/>
Then the curse may be taken from Cain or his posterity <strike>will</strike><br/>
but his posterity will be below Abel's.</p>

<p>All are slaves. Polititions are <br/>
the worse slaves. And if we dont do right we too shall<br/>
catch the lash. We are the freest people on the earth<br/>
Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Victoria]] is a slave. She had to ask the liberty <br/>
to marry Prince [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, b. 1819|Albert]]; but we are free. We have the right, <br/>
God and his Kingdom.</p>

<p>Let us not dishonor God his Kingdom <br/>
or our brethren. If we dishonour our brethren we shall<br/>
sink below them and their children. If the wife dishonour<br/>
her husband the children will dishonour the mother and <br/>
she must welter under it.</p>

<p>We get good from all men who speak by the Spirit of</p>",

men. If we speak incorrectly we shall be corrected. We want to<br/>
speak freely that we may gather good whether it is in the past present<br/>
or to come.</p>

<p>Brother [[John Kempton|Kempton]] has been speaking. He professes<br/>
to be a scholar; I do not, but he has murdered the English language<br/>
to day. I want speakers to speak the English language<br/>
correctly for our childrens sake.</p>

<p>As to principles there are no principles<br/>
in heaven earth or hell but what the Saints have to apply<br/>
in their prayer place.</p>

<p>If we could understand all things we <br/>
should know that here is the place to begin to make the people<br/>
happy. If we could understand the dealings and Providence<br/>
of God with us and the object of it there would not be the<br/>
discontent and murmuring of the people that there now is<br/>
but we should have peace and joy and contentment concerning<br/>
spiritual and temporal things.</p>

<p>I would say that temporal and<br/>
spiritual things are one; but what we call temporal are the<br/>
coarser things which we see with our eyes but the finer or<br/>
spiritual things we cannot see with our eyes unless They are<br/>
touched by the spirit of God. Then we could see spiritual<br/>
things.</p>

<p>To say the spiritual eye cannot see temporal<br/>
things is folly but it looks unnatural to see people put out<br/>
their own eyes to spite their neighbours.</p>

<p>Anciently God angels and eternal things<br/>
were considered natural. My mind can see many<br/>
things when clothed with the Spirit of God that my<br/>
eyes cannot.</p>

<p>In speaking of hell it is called very<br/>
hot but our God is a consuming fire. Hell is here.</p>",
42658.0,439,,"<p>It is said the Devil was cast down to the earth; also that he was cast<br/>
down to hell. He is in our midst striving to lead captive the<br/>
children of man.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] want the brethren to speak freely, to speak<br/>
all that is in them and if they have an error let it out and exchange<br/>
it for true principle.</p>

<p>Some of the Saints want more revelation<br/>
mysteries, great things; but do they know what they ask for<br/>
or what they have already got. If the request of many men<br/>
were granted it would be like casting pearls before swine.<br/>
They would trample them in the mire.</p>

<p>We have enough now of the Key words and<br/>
tokens to take us through the veil into the celestial world and<br/>
lead us to the throne of God and what more do you want?</p>

<p>Have you ever pondered in your hearts<br/>
by visions and the Spirits of God eternal things even the<br/>
redeeming of all worlds and from them down to the smallest<br/>
things God has made? Have you ever reflected upon<br/>
the great system of salvation of the creatures of God?</p>

<p>Is man contented? He is not.<br/>
Can man alter the decrees of God concering the seed of <br/>
[[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] or anything else? He cannot. Why not<br/>
quarrel about Christ coming instead of the Father?</p>

<p>When the Father appointed Jesus Christ<br/>
the First Born to come and redeem the earth there was<br/>
contention got up. ^The second Brother^ Lucifer the Son of the Morning<br/>
wanted the honour to come and redeem the earth; but<br/>
Christ was the appointed one. It was his right by<br/>
appointment and birthright; but the war and contention<br/>
became so hot and the influence of Lucifer was so great<br/>
that he got one third part of the host of heaven to join his<br/>
standard; and when he was hurled down to hell like<br/>
lightning from heaven, one <strike>One</strike> third was cast down</p>",
42658.0,440,,"<p>with him. Where is he and those spirits that were cast down with<br/>
him? They are here on the earth and have blinded the children<br/>
of men and who are still seeking to overthrow the Kingdom of God<br/>
<strike>but this is all right</strike></p>

<p>But this<br/>
is all right and we should be contented with what God sees fit<br/>
to grant unto us and be contented with our lot. If the devil<br/>
had been contented and acted in his place he would not have<br/>
been thrust down to hell.</p>

<p>Any man who seeks to do a thing he<br/>
cannot do and should not do is cast into hell: it makes a <br/>
hell for him. When a man asks for <strike>a</strike> things <strike>of</strike> that<br/>
does not belong to him it makes him unhappy; but do what<br/>
God wants you to do and wait on those who are above you<br/>
and all will be right.</p>

<p>Why did not one of the Apostles quarrel <br/>
with Jesus Christ to redeem the world? Jesus set a little<br/>
child in their midst and said if ye do not become as this<br/>
little child you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>If you would be the greatest man in the <br/>
Kingdom of God you must be the greatest servant. You<br/>
will do more than any other man.</p>

<p>The Apostles did not quarrel to know<br/>
who should or should not be President. Why do [[Brigham Young|I]] or you<br/>
not quarrel because we were not [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]?</p>

<p>To <u>want to,</u> <u>and</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>is hell</u>! Never<br/>
seek to do a thing you cannot accomplish. Every man has<br/>
[h]is lot appointed him and he should be contented with it<br/>
There is the work of God ^angels^ men and Devils.</p>

<p>Is the Bible good? and the Book <br/>
of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants? Yes they are<br/>
good. Those books contain the works of God angels <br/>
men and devils; and if you dont want to be in hell<br/>
all the time be content with your lot. If you dont learn</p>",

<p>Upon the remark of [[Henry Garlick Sherwood|Sherwood]] that he thought<br/>
we were kicked out of the frying pan into the fire"" the<br/>
President said we were kicked out of the fire into the middle<br/>

their interest lies in the building up of the Kingdom of God<br/>
then the Kingdom of God will roll on and the people will do <br/>

<p>Brother [[John Kempton|Kempton]] was very anxious to preach from the<br/>
text [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham's]] bosom. Liberty was granted him and<br/>
President Young followed and said:</p>

<p>""Bro Kempton has had his liberty as<br/>
is given to every man who speaks here. He has not<br/>
satisficed his mind at all. He may have much in his<br/>
mind but can say but little here. He is not able <br/>
to handle the Scriptures and know all the spirtis in<br/>
the world as some can.</p>

<p>When the dark sayings in the <br/>
Scriptures are understood they are plain. The<br/>
Scritpures here that speaks of Abraham's bosom is not as<br/>
given by brother Kempton. Abraham is in Paradise. <br/>

<p>For me to explain is to tell the truth<br/>
A man that feels and talks to the people should be a Bible<br/>
of himself. If a man that teaches and leads the people<br/>
is not filled with truth so as to be able to teach the people<br/>
without quoting the teachings of others altogether, then he is<br/>
a blind guide and will go to help with those he leads.</p>

<p>It is the intention of the Lord to teach<br/>
man principle in progression until he shall know all things;<br/>
that he may rise through faith power and victory until he<br/>
obtains every good thing, even to rise to be gods, even the<br/>
sons of God. This blessing we cannot obtain without<br/>
experience.</p>

<p>We should not sin when we are tried, <strike>but</strike></p>",
42658.0,443,,"<p>and tempted, but overcome, which will give us glory honour and eternal life.</p>

<p>As fast as [[Brigham Young|I]] improve upon what I have more will<br/>
be given me. The Savior was subject to all that we were from<br/>
his birth to his death. He applied his heart unto wisdom. We<br/>
should do so too. Apply your hearts unto wisdom from day to<br/>
day and you will receive all that he did.</p>

<p>If I through out all that is in me what faults<br/>
I have will give place for truth and that which is good.</p>

<p>I feel to praise the name of God for all<br/>
that he has done for me. My heart is like [[Aminidab (BofM)|Aminidab's]] continually.</p>

<p>All persons see times when they wish truth to<br/>
pervail. Mormonism is all truth. The Lord has raised<br/>
up a Prophet and Seer who brought it forth and established it. He<br/>
was faithful unto death and sealed [[Joseph Smith Jr.|his]] testimony with his blood.</p>

<p>A certain prophecy says when the Book<br/>
of Mormon shall come unto the Gentiles the Jews shall be<br/>
gathered to [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]].</p>

<p>All truth is ours in heaven earth and hell.<br/>
It is all truth we want. But does the Church or Elders want<br/>
correcting? Yes for they have errors and false notions. The <br/>
net has all kinds of fish. We have some as cursed rascals<br/>
among us as dwell on the earth and we find evil here as well <br/>
as anywhere else. Yet Zion is here. It is in my heart<br/>
Peace dwells with me and good principles will prevail here<br/>
until all evil is overcome even in all the earth.</p>

<p>Let no man find fault with his neighbours<br/>
until he is righteous. I dont ask anything of others that<br/>
I wont do myself and never find fault with another about anything<br/>
you allow in yourself. Dont you swear scold and do wrong<br/>
yourself? Then dont find fault with another for it until you<br/>
subdue your own passions and the evil that is in yourself.</p>

<p>Some will do anything to preside over <br/>
another when they cannot preside over themselves. </p>",

<p>The anniversary of the enterance of the Pioneers in<br/>
the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] of the great Salt Lake this day was celebrated with<br/>
much display and enthusiasm by the citizens.</p>

<p>At the rising of the Sun the stillness of <br/>
the morning was broken by the roar of cannon saluting the<br/>
rising D<strike>d</strike>ay. The mammoth carriage of the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Brass<br/>
Band was soon in motion and the band sent forth on<br/>
the wings of morning strains of martial and inspiring <br/>
music. The citizens poured forth from their homes<br/>
dressed befitting the occasion of a celebration and gathered<br/>
together a congregation of rejoicing people.</p>

<p>The order of the day was kept up by<br/>
the firing of cannon 110 times and the procession paraded<br/>
the streets. The escort consisted of the Nauvoo Brass<br/>
Band the Military Band and the Pioneers of '47 the<br/>
Regency; the Aged Fathers; Young Ladies followed by the<br/>
Mothers in Israel; young girls; young men and young<br/>
women. The Presidency and the officers of State formed<br/>
the escorted party.</p>

<p>After the escort came the rear party of<br/>
the procession, 24 Bishops forming a phalanx of the combined<br/>

was 20 days from [[Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Indipendance]] and was the largest up to this date<br/>

<p>I received three letters one from [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus Carter]] <br/>
one from my brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] and the other from my brother<br/>

<p>She died at half past 7 o'clock in the evening. Also [[Elizabeth Norton Hart Woodruff|Elizabeth]]<br/>

were own sisters by birth.</p>",
42658.0,446,,"<p>I found from my brother Azmon's letter that<br/>
he was in much sorrow. He was baptized into the Church of<br/>

in 1833. He was ordained an Elder and myself a Teacher with<br/>
the hands of Gerah Pulsipher. Elizabeth his wife with the<br/>
assistance of the Devil made war upon my brother and cursed<br/>
him to leave the Church. He had been in sorrow ever <br/>
since.</p>

<p>On my arrival home with my letters I<br/>
called my aged Father into the room with me and read him<br/>
the letters from his two oldest sons containing the news<br/>
of the death of both his own wife and his son's wife<br/>

<p>A Special <strike>General</strike> Conference of the Church<br/>
<strike>of Jesus Christ of Latter</strike>day Saints<br/>
Held in the Tabernacle<br/>
Great Salt Lake City<br/>
<u>Sept 7th 1857</u></p>

<p>There were present the First Presidency — Brigham <br/>
Young Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards and of<br/>
the quorum of the Twelve Orson Hyde W. Woodruff G. A. <br/>
Smith and E. T. Benson, the first seven Presidents of <br/>
the Seventies and the other quorums and a large congregation</p>

<p>President H. C. Kimball arose and said<br/>
the Conference was not for the benefit of one but for the whole<br/>
""Is the Store House full of wheat? Is the tithing butter and cheese<br/>
brought in? Some of you will ask can I get my endowments? </p>",
42658.0,447,,"<p>But [[Heber Chase Kimball|I]] will say not one of you will get your endowments until you pay your<br/>
tithing.""</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] arose and said:</p>

<p>""As far as you can exercise patience<br/>
you should do so. We are in comfortable circumstances and<br/>
now let us sit here and worship God and let our business rest and<br/>
let us reflect a little and exercise ourselves on our religion. Let<br/>
our houses rest and farms and crops and let the people be<br/>
still and not talk in the house or about the window.</p>

<p>In my meditations I am like other men<br/>
who refelct; and I marvel to see men so intent upon objects<br/>
that will soon perish.</p>

<p>How many there are here who ask the<br/>
question, ""How long will the conference last? I want to go. I<br/>
cannot stop."" While others will be willing to stop and<br/>
worship God.</p>

<p>Some Spirits are like the troubled sea, weary.<br/>
If I could have my wish about it, I would wish such spirits to<br/>
pass out of our midst, leave the congregation and let us worship<br/>
in peace.</p>

<p>We are such an industrious pople that we<br/>
could not commence conference until Sunday. I care as<br/>
little about our gardens farms hurders &amp;c as you do about<br/>
snuffing ashes.</p>

<p>If you get all the riches of the wared<br/>
you cannot hold them. If you will get the wisdom <br/>
if is your privilege to possess you will know that God<br/>
cares more for you than the ravens. If you seek the <br/>
Kingdom of God and its righteousness the Lord will add<br/>
all things else that is necessary</p>

<p>Our first duty is to provide for our<br/>
families, but we must take a course to accomplish it<br/>
Goals are often rich and the wise in legery. This is the</p>",
42658.0,448,,"<p>providence of God. We may be ever so rich to day; we may be<br/>
beggars to-morrow. This is the case with those who are before [[Brigham Young|me]]<br/>
Let me draw the line between the good and the evil. Have you not<br/>
had more good than evil? — more than you would have had if<br/>
you had been in the world? More peace than in the world and<br/>
happiness in the meditations of the things of God than in the world?<br/>
Yes you have. Then shame upon the man who complains of <br/>
his hardships.</p>

<p>The worse persecutions of the people are their<br/>
best days. I went to [[Missouri|Missouri]] in 1834, walked 2000 miles<br/>
in 70 days was so weak I could not step over the fences three<br/>
feet high. I now have better health and strength than<br/>
ever before. I would give all [[Geauga County, Ohio|Geauga]] county for the experience<br/>
I have had in six months</p>

<p>Now stay here. Dont go home until<br/>
conference ends. Many of the Saints forget Mormonism.<br/>
Any body who enjoyed the light of the revelations of Jesus Christ<br/>
must have the Spirit of God. The key to Mormonism is all<br/>
the truth in all eternity that ever was revealed or ever will<br/>
be that exists with God [[angels|angels]] or men. Where shall I go<br/>
to find truth? In Mormonism. If you get a truth<br/>
anywhere it is there for that covers all truth</p>

<p>When the light came to me sin did not<br/>
revice in me and I died but I revived and lived. I had<br/>
not consented to the death of any good man like [[Stephen (NT)|Stephen]]<br/>
as [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] did. But let him come to any of the <br/>
Churches reared to his name and the world would kill<br/>
him if they could.</p>

<p>I will ask you, are you accepted<br/>
of the Father and the Son? You will say I don't know.<br/>
Well it is because your minds are taken up with the<br/>
things of the world. Then let us stay here<br/>
until we know.</p>",
42658.0,449,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] am a Mormon or what is called so and I know<br/>
that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] was a Prophet. It was revealed to me long before his<br/>
death. I always thought while reading the <strike>world</strike> bible about a <br/>
Prophet that I would go around the world to see one or any man<br/>
who knew things as they were and not have to guess at them.</p>

<p>Everything will have to bow to Mormonism<br/>
or eternal light and truth. We have the true government of<br/>
all the earth. I know the path this people has to walk.<br/>
I am prepared for Mormonism. <u>There has no better man<br/>
than Joseph Smith ever lived on earth.</u> <u>Hear it O ye<br/>
Heavens,</u> — <u>O ye Earth</u> <u>and all men:</u> <u>This is my testimony<br/>
that he was as good a man</u> <u>as ever lived since Jesus.</u></p>

<p>Th<strike>ir</strike>e world will not vote for a man<br/>
because his religion governs. They will not have God govern<br/>
them, because of their vursed meannesss; but if God did<br/>
not or can not deal out justice and rule in righteousness,<br/>
who can?""</p>

<p>[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]], [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]], [[George Albert Smith|George A.<br/>
Smith]] and Wilford Woodruff followed in speeches and then<br/>
President Young again arose and said:</p>

<p>""I read that when the wicked rule the<br/>
people mourn. Ask the world, do the wicked rule?<br/>
Yes; and they mourn. Do they week a righteous man<br/>
to rule? No. If the curse has followed the rule of<br/>
the wicked will follow. But let them sleep on and<br/>
take their rest; but we understand the Lord has rent the<br/>
veil, sent angels to us and the Gospel is preached to the poor</p>

<p>The difference between us and the world<br/>
is that they say but do not, believed not. We say and <br/>
both believe and do. The world spend thousands<br/>
of dollars to preach the Gospel but do not believe it</p>

<p>When the judgements of God rest upon<br/>
the wicked and they are cut off then will be the gleaning</p>",
42658.0,450,,"<p>of the grapes after the vinetage is done.</p>

<p>Let the righteous reign and the righteous will<br/>
rejoice in the house of Israel. God takes up the isles as a little<br/>
thing; builds up and pulls down at his pleasure and why are not<br/>
the people willing he should reign? Because of their meanness.</p>

<p>Some may ask do not good men reign?<br/>
[[Brigham Young|I]] will ask a question: Should an angel come to President [[Millard Fillmore|Filmore]]<br/>
and tell him how to govern ^the nation^ <strike>it</strike> and he was to tell of it would they<br/>
not shut him up in a mad house? And if God was to reveal<br/>
to him truth concerning the people and he was to tell of it the<br/>
people would kill him. This is the situation of this<br/>
government _ the best on earth. But let the President sware<br/>
take the name of God in vain and curse God in all its<br/>
forms they w<strike>ill</strike>ould let him and ^stay with them [illegible]^ hail fellows well met</p>

<p>The nation will be damned and<br/>
go to hell who killed [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]: The States of [[Illinois|Illinois]] in<br/>
connection with the carthage mob, and the whole government<br/>
sustain it and they will be damned from the President to<br/>
the least member.</p>

<p>I think no more of a King of President<br/>
than of the poorest beggar. The worse scoundrel is the<br/>
most popular man in the nation</p>

<p>This nation is the first the Gospel<br/>
was sent unto. She has killed the prophets that God<br/>
sent unto them and their doom will be the neither most hell.""</p>

<p><u>Testimony of [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]</u><br/>

<p>Willard Richards said</p>

<p>""We have had much testimony to day<br/>

Carthage Jail and exclaimed ""I am a dead man Joseph fell dead</p>",
42658.0,451,,""">September the 8th</time></strong></p>

 and the<br/>
second day of the conference Judge Brochus requested the<br/>
privilege of addressing the people and it was granted him

<p>He arose and commenced his speech<br/>
by testifying of his kind reception among this people. He<br/>
had been sick among them he said and kindly treated.<br/>
The flys had been brushed from his face by a lady and he<br/>
was thankful.</p>

<p>He then refered to the Judiciary and <br/>
requested the people to sustain it and professed to be very<br/>
sorry that he was going to leave it. He then refered<br/>
to a report in circulation that he came here for the purpose<br/>
of being returned a delegate to Washington and other<br/>
things that were reported against him &amp;c.</p>

<p>Next he took up the subject of his<br/>
appointment and said that President [[Millard Fillmore|Filmore]] had appointed him<br/>
although he was a democrat; and observed that he should<br/>
not have been appointed had he not been a <u>capable</u> <u>virtous</u> <br/>
<strike>was a</strike> <u>good</u> man.</p>

<p>He then addressed the ladies upon</p>",
42658.0,452,,"<p>the subject of the Washington monument and wished them to procure a<br/>
block of marble and present it to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]; also wished them to<br/>
donate for the building of the monument and talked much about<br/>
[[George Washington|Washington]] and his battles and good deeds</p>

<p>[[Perry Brocchus|He]] spoke of the pers<strike>c</strike>ecutions of the Saints<br/>
considered them badly treated, had sent to [[Council House, Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] where<br/>
our dead was burried and had a spring of myrtle plucked<br/>
He carried it in his bosom. It was now dryed up. He<br/>
showed it to the congregation</p>

<p>In speaking to the ladies he said he<br/>
hoped they would become a virtueous people. He did<br/>
not wish them to send the block of marble unless they <br/>
could do it in full fellowship with each of the seperate<br/>
States composing the United States</p>

<p>He had read something casting<br/>
reflections upon the United States Government concerning<br/>
our persecutions; but he would defend the Government as<br/>
long as he had a tongue to speak or hand to lift; and<br/>
said the Government could not do anything for us as they<br/>
had no power; but if we wanted redress of our wrongs<br/>
apply to Missouri and Illinois where we had received<br/>
them.</p>

<p>This part of Brochus speech stirred the<br/>
blood of the whole congregation; and much more was said <br/>
by him calculated to arrouse the indignation and<br/>
wrath of the people.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] Reply.</p>

<p>President Young arose and said that Judge Brochus was<br/>
either profoundly ignorant or wilfully wicked in presenting<br/>
some sentiments which he had to the assembly that<br/>
day. How he supposed for a moment that Brochus</p>",
42658.0,453,,"<p>was going to throw out a challenge upon that stand in a religious<br/>
meeting and presented such sentiments as he had he should not for<br/>
a moment have given his consent to the [[Perry Brocchus|Judge]] to speak on that<br/>
occasion. The [[Brigham Young|President]] said several stood by and wished<br/>
to take up the challenge given by Brochus but he would not<br/>
permit of it for some might have got their hair pulled if not<br/>
their throats cut and he would not have it</p>

<p>The President then wished the meeting to<br/>
adjourn and the assembly to meet again <strike>in the Conference</strike> and<br/>
transact business in the capacity of a conference for which the meeting<br/>
had been called. Meeting adjourned for one hour.</p>

<p>After the adjournment following previous speakers<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] spoke. He said ""I will tell one <strike>tell one</strike><br/>
thing that will have a great effect upon us and remove the<br/>
mist. When we come to the house of the Lord bring<br/>
an offering to the Lord. I will make an offering to<br/>
the Lord and the Priesthood as [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] did to [[Melchizedek (OT)|Melchezedic]]<br/>
And offer the best you have.  Did not this law come<br/>
from [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] who was ordained under the hands of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]]?  Brigham<br/>
Young was ordained under the hands of Joseph to hold the keys<br/>
of the Kingdom of God. If you strive against him you<br/>
strive against God who sent him.""</p>

<p>After Brother Heber had spoken President<br/>
Young then arose and said:</p>

<p>""I will speak of principle. You may<br/>
think it is a novel Conference. How long has it ^been^ since<br/>
we have had the privilege of spending a Conference undisturbed?<br/>
A long time.</p>

<p>I would like to hear brother [[John Kempton|Kempton]]<br/>
speak or any good man. I will preach brother <br/>

<p>who lives and dies a Saint.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] will tell whether the messanger sent to brother<br/>
[[John Kempton|Kempton]] was of God or the Devil. If the messenger was<br/>
not of God he would know it. If the messenger was anywhere<br/>
else but here he must have come from heaven or from another<br/>
hell for we are in hell</p>

<p>Go to the world and preach the Gospel.<br/>
You will find some people as honest and good as angels as far<br/>
as they know; but do they have revelations from God and know<br/>
the things of God. No they do not. If brother Kempton<br/>
has had his sins forgiven and remitted without baptism so<br/>
could all men. But this is false. No man could<br/>
have forgiveness without the sheding of blood and baptism.<br/>
The Bible says unless you Keep the commandments you<br/>
cannot be saved.</p>

<p>When brother Kempton says he knows<br/>
his sins were forgiven before he was baptized he knows<br/>
not what he says. At times the Spirit of God is<br/>
given to men to see the Kingdom of God and they think<br/>
they are in it shen they have not entered the door of <br/>
baptism</p>

<p>Dont go and tell the different denomination<br/>
that because their sins are not forgiven that they are always<br/>
going to dwell in hell for if they are honest they will have<br/>
a glory greater than many who carry the Gospel to man</p>

<p>In the afternoon the officers of the church was <br/>
presented and then President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said.</p>

<p>""I want to establish some travelling Bishops, a thing<br/>
which we never have done. When I approach the subject of<br/>
Bishops I pause not with a trembling hand but I want to take<br/>
time and look at it all day until we can see clearer than we now<br/>
do. This people stick to the world love the world. We<br/>
should use the world not worship it. No man is free<br/>
indeed until he is free in Christ and above the world. Don't<br/>
worship the world. You will not be free. Is there any<br/>
one that has anything but what God gave him. You cannot<br/>
make one hair white or black. Now it is our duty to <br/>
feed clothe and sustain the families of those who are in<br/>
the vineyard preaching. If we let them suffer and they die their<br/>
blood will be required at our hands. We as a people have never<br/>

wept much. I have laboured much from that day until this to<br/>
keep things right. It is said that it is the little foxes that spoil<br/>
the vines. We have a Prophet for a leader. Now pay your<br/>
tithing and make good measure when you sell anything, and fulfil<br/>
all your covenants if they are made right. We shall then prosper<br/>

but I will write a piece to be published in the paper.""</p>

<p>[[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] said ""I am going to make<br/>

said</p>

during the day. He said he wished to say a few words to the <br/>
Mormon Battalion</p>

<p>""Those who are wanting their extra pay are<br/>

those men and give them the papers and they cheat you out<br/>
of it dont complain and I say to those men not to take<br/>
any papers from those <strike>f</strike>who have had their pay or sold<br/>

here and you can get it.</p>

<p>You did not enlist to get $8 per month<br/>
They enlisted us to kill us and because we speak our sentiments<br/>
we are accused of treason. I dont ask any odds of the <br/>
United States. I will express my feelings. To drive<br/>
us from our mullions and our possessions ^and then require us to fight their battles^ is not right.</p>

<p>I shall pay my tithing. The Twelve<br/>
will pay one tenth of their possessions and the Bishops and<br/>
all will pay their tithing.</p>

falls I am willing to fall with it. I would rather fall<br/>
then stand if the Priesthood falls""</p>

<p>We hear the brethren arise and return thanks for the<br/>
blessings received. We can respond to it. The work is<br/>
of all importance to the human family. The brethren are all<br/>
willing to do right; and they say Lord not my will but thine<br/>
be done. If the Lord should say come and preach to us we<br/>
would say Amen to it.</p>

<p>The Lord has his means to carry on his<br/>
work and also his own means to do it. When the people's<br/>
hearts are prepared to do the will of God the victory is ours</p>

<p>If we come to understanding so as to <br/>
have the organization of the Kingdom so that every one will<br/>
act in unison like a beautiful piece of machinery we gain<br/>
the victory. We shall then know how to order our spe<strike>e</strike>ach<br/>
and converstaion aright before God</p>

<p>This is a good people. Cannot we<br/>
be better? We have faith and knowledge. Cannot we<br/>
have more of it? Yes there is an eternity of it</p>

<p>We have learned to obey by the things<br/>
we suffer. But what do we behold? There is evil surmising<br/>
sp<strike>ad</strike>eaking and doing. The evil intruders ha<strike>d</strike>ve not left us<br/>
Who is keeping the commandment that thou shalt love thy<br/>
neighbour as thyself? We will save his neighbours<br/>
garden crops &amp;c. We shall then believe and pra<strike>l</strike>ctise</p>",
42658.0,460,,"<p><u>October:</u> <u>1851.</u></p>

<p>all the commands. We shall have but one common interest. [[Brigham Young|I]]<br/>
dont care what you believe if you practise right and as though you<br/>
loved the Lord and then you will do right.</p>

<p>There is no school like your own experiance<br/>
When I heard [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] speak I thought of former days<br/>
when men from [[Canada, British North America|Canida]] and other places would stop 50 miles<br/>
this side of [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] leave the money with the wife go and<br/>
see [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] say how I love you; but let Joseph ask them for<br/>
a few dollars and they would immediately dodge at it</p>

<p>While you were in the world you<br/>
would go away. Now you are here I cannot get you<br/>
to go to the fat Vallies because [[Warsaw, Hancock County, Illinois|Warsaw]] and [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] are not<br/>
there. I felt like crying about [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa's]] company. They<br/>
were ready to go to hell. How ready the perople are to go to<br/>
hell! Let the eyes of the Saints be open. I had<br/>
to <strike>be plead</strike> pled with Amasa Lyman and company for days not<br/>
to go. I could not stay them. Now I want you<br/>
to go and you wont go. I want to have you go to<br/>
[[Iron County, Utah Territory|Iron County]]. The people here are so full of wheat and <br/>
good things that they loathe it. if you dont want to pay <br/>
your tithing the Lord dont want your tithing until you<br/>
go into hell. If you dont want to save yourselves<br/>
nor your children nor your dead dont you pay your<br/>
tithing; if you do want to save them pay your tithing<br/>
for it is for your benefit not mine. You cannot<br/>
do the Lord any good in it nor add to his glory<br/>
but it is for yourself</p>

<p>The cattle have come in well of late<br/>
and I think the best have been sent in. You should<br/>
be industrious and saving. I do not want <strike>an</strike>my<br/>
children to be lazy. If I die I do not want any<br/>
man to foster them in <strike>laziness</strike> idleness. I wish my boys<br/>
had to work as I did for a living.</p>",

<p><u>General Conference</u><br/>
<u>October the 6th</u></p>

<p>Conference assembled according to adjournment.<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said the time had come to commence<br/>
the business of the Semi-Annual Conference. The business of<br/>
the last Conference was productive of more good than any Conference<br/>
we ever held. The keeping of the ""Word of Wisdo"" has done<br/>
much good. I will be exceedingly glad when we arrice at<br/>
wisdom in all things.</p>

<p>The Word of Wisdom was given in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]<br/>
twenty years ago for the benefit of all Saints. When we<br/>
live 20 or fifty years longer we shall see that we do not<br/>
understand much of the Word of Wisdom.  We are but babies<br/>
in understanding wisdom. Who understands it were all<br/>
spoken that might be spoken. There is but one system<br/>
of explaining any revelation and that is the revelation of Jesus <br/>
Christ in the heart of man when he prossesses the Holy Ghost</p>

<p>We are forbidden to eat meat in hot<br/>
weather. Hot drinks and tobacco is not good for man<br/>
You should not eat to over loading your stomach. There<br/>
is a greater lack in my system of wisdom of tempering my<br/>
food and ^exercise^ than in eating meat or tobacoo.</p>

<p>Tithing is coming in so fast there<br/>
will  not be room to receive it.</p>

<p>I wanted this Conference to come together<br/>
so that I could see their faces not to scold them. I want<br/>
to see the faces of the Saints. They look better to me than<br/>
all the glories of the earth. I said when the brethren got<br/>
out of prison I wanted o sit and look at them three weeks</p>

<p>Our Graineries and Store House are full</p>",
42658.0,462,,"<p><time datetime=""1851-10""><u>October</u> <u>1851</u></time></p>

<p>of wheat and good things.</p>

<p>If this people are rich beautiful and happy, <br/>
I am with them; if they are miserable, I am still with them<br/>
if the people are not all crowned and saved none of us will be</p>

<p>It is in vain for one man to build himself<br/>
up and neglect his brother's interest. He will fail in it.</p>

<p>We must begin to manufacture all we want or<br/>
we are slaves to everything in all the earth</p>

<p>Everything is against Mormonism, and Mormonism <br/>
is against everything; everything is against us. Hear it<br/>
O Earth for the Kingdom of God is against all earth and hell<br/>
This is true and we shall fight them until the kingdoms<br/>
of this world become the Kingdoms of our God. We shall<br/>
fight battle after battle until the victory is won. We<br/>
have to fight and lay down our lives for Christ's<br/>
sake.</p>

<p>We now want to gather companies to<br/>
go to the different VAlleys. I want the potters to remain<br/>
here and work at their business.</p>

<p>Jesus descended below all things<br/>
before he assended above all things. We have to sacrifice<br/>
ever freely in order to be exalted before God. I once<br/>
said I will go and build me a house on the hill<br/>
out of the mud. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said you will stay where<br/>
you are. This was enough. I dodged as quick <br/>
as I could. I said, Enough. Since I have been <br/>
willing to be governed by circumstances that have <br/>
surrounded me and leave the event in the hands of<br/>
God""</p>

<p>Judge [[Zerubbabel Snow|Snow]] then spoke and afterwards<br/>
the President said:<br/>
""At our Conference we appointed [[Nathaniel Henry Felt|Felt]] and<br/>
[[John Banks|Banks]] to be travelling Bishops to visit other Bishops and</p>",
42658.0,463,,"<p><u>October</u> <u>1851</u> <u>December</u><br/>
call them to an account and see that they are faithful Bishops<br/>
and you should feed the poor and do your duty untl the Spirit<br/>
of God rests upon you and you hold the Keys of the Melchezedick<br/>
Priesthood and the power of it rest upon you forever.""</p>

<p>Brothers [[John Banks|Banks]] and [[Nathaniel Henry Felt|Felt]] were then<br/>
ordained under the hands of the Presidency.</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] [[David Fullmer|O. Fulmer]] <strike>and</strike><br/>
[[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] ^and [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]]^ were appointed as missionaries and after a discourses<br/>
from [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]], and from [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] upon the <br/>
opening of the new settlements President [[Brigham Young|Young]] closed with<br/>
our address upon the education of our children. This was<br/>
one of the most interesting conferences ever held by this people.</p>

<p>President Young's Medical Lecture.</p>

<p>Delivered before the Board of Health<br/>
At [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]]<br/>
<time datetime=""1851-12"">Dec. 1851</time></p>

<p>""I wish to impart intelligence to the people. My first<br/>
proposition is the science of <strike>health</strike> medicine. The study and<br/>
practice of medicine as a science, if it may be called a<br/>
science is the most imperfect of my science in exist<strike>e</strike>ance<br/>
as it is practised by the doctors of the present day. The<br/>
doctors and priests of the day send more to death and<br/>
hell than anywhere else. About one in a million may<br/>
get some glory. A bigger set of cursed scoundrals<br/>
never graced the earth than that class. Surgary is a<br/>
different class and is very necessary in many instances and<br/>
that system can be learned. But to learn the system<br/>
of man they cannot: no more learn that than they can<br/>
learn the heavens</p>",
42658.0,464,,"<p>A worse set of ignoramuses do not walk the earth<br/>
They do not know how to turn wind in a man's body when it gets<br/>
cross ways. If you cut their infernal throats the people will<br/>
live. I know what this society is here for. It is to<br/>
import what knowledge they have to others. But I have seen<br/>
the fally of the doctors even at my own doors. Take them as<br/>
a whole they are the most damnable set on earth. Their practices<br/>
are infamous and their medicines produce death. If the people<br/>
want to eat calomel let them do it and be damned; but dont<br/>
feed it to any of my family. If any doctor does and I know<br/>
it I would kill him as quick as I would for feeding arsnic<br/>
I do not employ such doctors to visit <span class=""unclear"">[me]</span>. I do not employ<br/>
any doctor to visit me.</p>

<p>The practice of doctors in visiting women<br/>
child birth is damnable. Women should be let alone<br/>
and let Nature have its perfect work. Let a woman keep<br/>
her child if she can two or three years but she cannot do<br/>
it. When the time has come Nature will deliver<br/>
her of her child without a doctor. Dont fret. Let<br/>
everything take it's proper course and sickness w<strike>ill</strike>ould depart<br/>
away.</p>

<p>The doctors in New Haven ^Ct.^ met by mutual<br/>
agreement to see how far they could frighten a man and did<br/>
actually frighten him to death, a robust hearty man.</p>

<p>Many things should be said to this<br/>
people. There has not been a doctor baptized into<br/>
this church that has the Holy Ghost but what will acknowledge<br/>
he is a fool. There is not a physician in the church or<br/>
in the world ^that is taught from on high by revelation^ but what will acknowledge this to be a true<br/>
doctrine: If there is a doctor who can see and know<br/>
man from head to foot and know how to care his diseases<br/>
by revelation such are the only true and safe doctors on earth<br/>
All other are fools.</p>",
42658.0,465,,"<p>I see <strike>medicine</strike> ^men die^ in the hands of the doctors. The medicines<br/>
kill them. Wdy dont they tell what ails th patient or acknowledge<br/>
they dont know. The factory there is among this class is disgraceful and<br/>
makes me mad and the day will come when you will not wonder at<br/>
my feelings</p>

<p>You are natural persons and God has made you<br/>
natural. If you are with child that child will come forth by<br/>
nature without a doctor. The earth is just so will bring<br/>
forth of itself seed after its kind.</p>

<p>If a person is sick and has not faith to be<br/>
healed give them herbs the products of the earth and it will care<br/>
you, until it is time to die.</p>

<p>When a cat is sick she will eat catnip without<br/>
a doctor, and she gets well. Nature prompts her to it<br/>
If a dog is bit with a rattlesnake he will dig a hole in the earth<br/>
and lie in the ground until the poison is gone. So nature<br/>
will teach us as well as the cat and dog. When a toad is bit<br/>
by a spider it will go and eat plantain if it can get it</p>

<p>If a child is to die in being born let<br/>
it die but dont employ a doctor to kill it. How will you<br/>
be instructed? I will tell you what to do. If  you are<br/>
taken sick dont be frightened but be calm. If you<br/>
get a cold let Nature be judge. Disease will go up and<br/>
down through the system to find a place to be located</p>

<p>It is as uch our duty to know how <br/>
to cure our system as to feed our body. The doctors would<br/>
say you are diseased but dont know it. Who made the<br/>
doctors? The Devil. The Lord did not make the<br/>
doctors of the present day</p>

<p>Such a thing as a man midwife <br/>
was not known until about the year 1500. Why did not<br/>
all the women di before this time? Look at the Indians<br/>
for one thousand years. Millions of children have been</p>",
42658.0,466,,"<p>born in the wilderness male and female and they live and not die<br/>
without a doctor.</p>

<p>You may ask what shall we do? I will<br/>
tell you. I will give you a lesson and I want you to<br/>
remember it. When you go to visit a woman in travel<br/>
let her alone until her full time has come. Remember<br/>
it and let the mother alone. Let your system be<br/>
natural. Teach them also to execise all they can<br/>
that when they come to be delivered it iwll be better<br/>
for them.</p>

<p>A doctor if he had good sense would<br/>
not wish to visit women in childbirth and if a woman<br/>
had good sense she would not wish a man to doctor<br/>
her on such an occasion</p>

<p>I want you to teach your<br/>
children the <strike>truth</strike> principle of birth.  I talk as I do<br/>
for the epeople will not sens anything unless they are<br/>
half knocked down or thunder rolls in their ears<br/>
soft words will not do. I want you to hear<br/>
and understand</p>

<p>There has been some difficulty in<br/>
this Board of Health. If I had been with you, you<br/>
would not have had any difficulty. It has been<br/>
through misunderstanding. If you understood<br/>
prinicple you would not quarrel. You may spread<br/>
culomel on your bread and butter and eat it if you<br/>
wish but it is as deadly poison as arsinic but not<br/>
as quick. It is not good. You may ask if<br/>
it was ever good in any case? There are cases<br/>
where it might be a benefit; but it would want a <br/>
revelation to tell when it was.</p>

<p>There is not poison in lobelia.<br/>
I will give 5000 dollars for the 16 part of an oz. of</p>",
42658.0,467,,"<p>poison that can be extraded out of all the lobelia in this Valley</p>

<p>It is not probable that any two persons are<br/>
organized just alike in all respects. Then who is a physician<br/>
None, unless he be taught of God and is a prophet or revelator<br/>
he cannot understand the human system know disease and<br/>
what will cure it.</p>

<p>I dont care how a man acts if he intends<br/>
to act right and when he acts wrong is willing to be righted</p>

<p>We will take the best physician of the day that<br/>
lives the closest to the Lord, I dont care how well he is<br/>
he will be brought down as a fool, for he will be made to<br/>
let God be honoured</p>

<p>I have been on a journey in the dust.<br/>
I have got dust on my brain: that is what ails me. It<br/>
will work off. Could a doctor tell what ails me? No.<br/>
Can a doctor tell what ails a sick man by feeling of his<br/>
pulse? No more than he could by feeling of a dogs tail <br/>
There is no Physician unless he is taught of God</p>

<p>You should learn how to doctor yourself<br/>
You should study your own system. Any people who<br/>
must trust to a doctor at all times will die. But trust<br/>
in God and you will live longer</p>

<p>What a different time it would be if all<br/>
trusted in God rather than in the doctors; for 9 out of<br/>
10 die under the doctors' cure who would live if they trusted<br/>
in God alone. Dont get frightened and and you will <br/>
do well enough. It is just as reasonable to send for a<br/>
doctor to have a calf colt or pig brought forth as it is<br/>
for a chlid</p>

<p>After you have received your resurrected<br/>
bodies you will bring for Spirits to all eternity who <br/>
will go to some world and take a tabernacle or body the<br/>
same as we have. You dont want a doctor anymore</p>",
42658.0,468,,"<p>here than there.</p>

<p>If the membrs of this socity are true either<br/>
male or female they will impart all teh useful knowledge they<br/>
hae to others. If they are not willing to do this they are<br/>
corrupt. If one man knows more than another let him tell<br/>
his knowledge and if a man knows more than all the rest let<br/>
him be a father unto the people and teach them and not act like<br/>
a boy. If I hold myself equal I am equal. If I listed<br/>
myself superior let me manifest it by doing a better deed and being<br/>
superior myself.</p>

<p>It is the man that rejects light and knowledge<br/>
when shown to him that God condemns and I condemn him<br/>
Some say we have spiritual wives but I think God has made<br/>
us all natural and I think we should be natural.""</p>

<p><u>Extract From the Proclamation</u></p>

<p>Of Governor Young to the inhabitants of the Territory of Utah<br/>
to set apart the 1st day of January as a Thanksgiving Day</p>

<p>""And I recommend to all good citizens of Utah that they<br/>
abstain from everything that is calculated to mar or grieve<br/>
the Spirit of their Heavenly Father on that day; that they rise<br/>
early in the morning of the first day in the New Year and<br/>
wash their bodies with pure water; that all men attend<br/>
to their flocks and herds with carefulness and see that no<br/>
creature in the care is hungry thirsty or cold while the<br/>
women are preparing the best of food for their householdz<br/>
and their children ready to receive it in cleanliness and with<br/>
cheerfulness: Then let the head of each family bow down<br/>
upon his knees before the God of Israel and acknowledge<br/>
all his sins and the sins of his household, call upon the<br/>
Father in the name of Jesus for every<strike>thing</strike> ^blessing^ that he desires<br/>
for himself, his kindred, the Israel of God, the universe<br/>
of man; praying with full purpose of heart and united</p>",
42658.0,472,,"""><u>Jan. 4th 1852</u></time>.</p>

<p>President Young took for his <strike>test</strike>subject ""Sin and the forgiveness<br/>
of sin.""</p>

<p>""I speak upon this subject because we are in the<br/>
midst of it. It has been among all the elements; it has been<br/>
in our houses in our families and in our hearts and although<br/>
it has been our constant companion there are but few who<br/>
understand the nature of sin.</p>

<p>""Many have made themselves miserable<br/>
by thinking they had sinned against the Holy Ghost; others<br/>
that they had sinned a great sin. But what have the<br/>
revelations of the Lord said upon these subjects?</p>

<p>""We learn that Jesus Christ came and<br/>
took a body and redeemed the world but that Lucifer rebelled<br/>
and was ca<strike>m</strike>st down without any body and he has sought to<br/>
vex and destroy the children of men. He seeks<br/>
diligently to draw all from the right path especially if a <br/>
Saint tries to follow the track and get where Jesus was</p>",
42658.0,473,,"<p>then the Devil will try hard to overthrow them</p>

<p>Many have thought they have committed much<br/>
sin when they have not understood the nature and works of sin<br/>
We must understand many principles and arrive at much knowledge<br/>
before we can ^fully^ understand the nature of sin</p>

<p>The v<strike>ai</strike>eil of darkness is owver the earth so that<br/>
the inhabitants of the eart are so overwhelmed in tradition and<br/>
darkness they do not know light from darkness truth from error<br/>
right from wrong or the difference between the dictation of the<br/>
Holy Spirit or that conscience which has been framed for them<br/>
by the dictation of their mothers and Priests. Many think<br/>
far more of the traditions of their youth than of any principle<br/>
that God could reveal unto them. Their mother must not<br/>
do anything on Sunday. To darn a stocking would<br/>
be a great sin.</p>

<p>Sin is one thing and tradition another. The<br/>
word of God revealed will tell what sin is while tradition will<br/>
not.</p>

<p>The education of the world is good as far as they<br/>
have any truth found in science which they possess; but<br/>
they do not understand truth in connection with the plan<br/>
of salvation.</p>

<p>I want the Saints here to understand that<br/>
they cannot sin against God and Jesus Christ and the<br/>
Priesthood against <strike>his</strike> ^their^ gamilies and the Saints and then come<br/>
and ask forgiveness of the Church then pass on smoothly<br/>
and think they will go to heaven. This is too cheep a way<br/>
to get to heaven. I want this subject riveted on your<br/>
hearts; if it is not you will not remember it</p>

<p>You must remember your covenants and<br/>
the law of God that is given to us. It is written that sin<br/>
is a transgression of the law. Where is the law? In the<br/>
books that is given us in the main; yet this does not go into</p>",
42658.0,474,,"<p>all the meanderings of life. Where do you find a law that<br/>
you shall not drive a teem across your neighbours lot not go to<br/>
his hay stack or suffer your famlies to take liberties that<br/>
you are not willing should be done to you? Yet you know<br/>
it to be wrong. But do unto others as you wish others to<br/>
do unto you is the law and the Prophets.</p>

<p>Some men who have been ordained<br/>
unto the Priesthood and are very high in authority will take<br/>
the name of God in vain and swear by this and that.<br/>
Does such persons suppose that the Church can forgive that<br/>
sin? If you do your hope is in vain. They<br/>
can never forgive that sin? No man can do it. None<br/>
but God alone and it never will be forgiven until he does it.</p>

<p>The time will come that if a man will <br/>
take the name of God in vain he will be hewn down without<br/>
judgement or trial. Hear it O, ye Elders, for it is<br/>
time. Let this people sanctify their hearts, and then<br/>
take the name of God in vain and it will not be forgiven<br/>
The time will al[s]o come when the parents are sanctifyed<br/>
before the Lord and their children rise up in disobedience<br/>
against them and they will be hewn down.</p>

<p>If you sin against God and take<br/>
the name of God in vain if you get forgiveness you will<br/>
have to be forgiven by Him and not from man.</p>

<p>Some think if they are alone and sware<br/>
or sin nobody will know it; but they will find themselves<br/>
mistaken. Still if a man has to sware let him<br/>
be alone. If a man damns himslef let him be alone<br/>
that others may not be propheted by his sin.</p>

<p>If you take the name of God in<br/>
vain I will not forgive it, for I cannot. If the Lord<br/>
will forgive you will forgive you for maring my feelings<br/>
by speaking in my ears</p>",
42658.0,475,,"<p>The more you see the veil parted and the more ^you^ <strike>we</strike><br/>
learn the more you will see that God's ways or not as our ways<br/>
This people are passing through a great school of experience. I remember<br/>
while in Kirtland that if any of the brethren felt their rights infringed<br/>
upon in anywise or abused they would retaliate and be ready<br/>
to quarrel about it and get up a lawsuit for a debt of three dollars<br/>
But the minds of Saints have become more noble</p>

<p>Now if a man is abused who understands<br/>
principle he is above quarrelling about it and he feels to say<br/>
it is nothing to me: I am not to suffer by it; but you who<br/>
have abused me have the penatly to pay. But if the devil<br/>
can only make you think that you are abused or illtreated<br/>
and you begin to fret about it and you give the devil power<br/>
over you in the end it is an bad as though you had done<br/>
wrong yourself.</p>

<p>Now if a man sins against you until<br/>
seventy times seven and he repents and with an humble<br/>
heart asks forgiveness you should forgive him for this is<br/>
the law. He must ask forgiveness and be honourable<br/>
or he cannot be forgiven</p>

<p>As much as been said, and many<br/>
fears entertained concerning the sin against the Holy Ghost<br/>
I wish to speak farther concerning that subject. To<br/>
sin against the Holy Ghost is a sin against God the Father<br/>
the Son and the Holy Ghost that bears<strike>eth</strike> <strike>witness</strike> record of them<br/>
A man cannot sin against the Holy Ghost until the<br/>
Holy Ghost has revealled unto him the Father and the Son<br/>
and a knowledge of eternal things in a great degree. When<br/>
he has a knowledge of these things and with his eye open<br/>
he rebels against God and defys his power, he sins against<br/>
all three. If a man does sin against the Holy <br/>
Ghost the people have nothing to do with it; for they<br/>
cannot forgive that sin and none but God can do it, and</p>",
42658.0,476,,"<p>probably he will not in this world nor in the world to come for<br/>
they become sons of pedition and probably will never repent of nor<br/>
have a disposition to.</p>

<p>If you blaspheme the name of God dont<br/>
ask this people to forgive you. ^for they cannot do it &amp;c out^<br/>
If God forgives the sin then<br/>
you can go down into the waters of baptism. When you get<br/>
knowledge you will be ashamed to sin</p>

<p>Now I want to bring this subject home<br/>
What are the acts of the people? Do they not sin and trespass<br/>
against their brethren, parents against their children and children<br/>
against their parents, the husband against the wife and the wife <br/>
against the husband? This is with us and this we can reach<br/>
and manage and tell what ought to be done.</p>

<p>You ought to cease from taking the<br/>
liberty of any person and do unto all as you would wish them<br/>
to do unto you. Infringe upon the rights of no one; borrow<br/>
no tool but what you will return according to promise. Take<br/>
no wood nor anything else but what belongs to you and if<br/>
you find anything that is not your own do not hide it<br/>
away but report it that the owner may be found</p>

<p>If I had some stones here I could<br/>
cast them and his two or three in this congregation in the<br/>
head who are guilty of these acts. You may say why<br/>
dont you tell who they are? Why you poor devil are<br/>
you not going to repent of it by and bye? If not when<br/>
the day of clensing and sanctifying of Israel comes you<br/>
will have to be sacrificed and your blood spilt upon<br/>
the ground; for the day will come when iniquity must<br/>
cease in Zion and the profane man who takes the name<br/>
of God in vain will be slain.</p>

<p>In the days of ancient Israel Justice<br/>
was dealt out in a manner that showed they understood<br/>
principle and revered the commands of God.</p>",
42658.0,477,,"<p>It was a mercy to many to have justice and<br/>
judgement executed upon them on the earth even to be stain and have<br/>
their blood poured out upon the earth that it might be tolerable<br/>
for them.</p>

<p>God made a covenant with [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] and his seed<br/>
that he would save them. When they committed sin he<br/>
slew them that he might save them by their <strike>sprinkling</strike> ^spilling^ their<br/>
blood as an offering. Glad they had lived in sin they might<br/>
have sinned so as not to have been forgiven or saved. It<br/>
was a mercy to slay them</p>

<p>Now brethren if you sin against God<br/>
go to God to get forgiveness if that sin is not unto death. There<br/>
is a sin unto death which we are told we need not pray for.<br/>
If you sin against your brother go to him to get forgiveness<br/>
Ask forgiveness at the hands of the innocent. If you <br/>
sin against your family your parents your husband<br/>
your wife your child seek forgiveness at their hands; <br/>
but what is done in secret should be forgiven in secret<br/>
and go no further that sins may be hid. But if<br/>
sins are committed openly they should ask forgiveness<br/>
and be forgiven openly. These are true principles<br/>
and let them be remembered forever</p>

<p><u>Goverenor [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]] Address</u><br/>
<u>On Slavery</u></p>

<p><u>Before</u> <u>the</u> <u>Legislative</u> <u>Assembly</u> <u>of</u> <u>Utah</u></p>

<p>The whole world are slaves. Eve partook of<br/>
the forbidden fruit and also [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] and this act<br/>
brought slavery upon all their posterity in some way or</p>",
42658.0,478,,"<p>other and this will continue in some way or other until we become<br/>
righteous enough to drive the devil and evil from the earth</p>

<p>[[Adam (OT)|Adam]] had two sons, [[Cain (OT)|Ca<strike>n</strike>in]] and<br/>
[[Abel (OT)|Abel]]. Cain was more given to evil than Abel. Adam<br/>
was called to offer sacrifice so also were his sons. The<br/>
sacrifice of Abel was more acceptable than Cain's and Cain<br/>
took it into his heart to put Abel out of the way so he<br/>
killed Abel</p>

<p>The Lord said I will not kill Cain<br/>
but I will put a mark upon him and it is seen in the<br/>
face of every Nigro<strike>l</strike>e on the earth and it is the decree of<br/>
God that that mark shall remain upon the seed of Cain<br/>
and the Curse until all the seed of Abel should be redeemed<br/>
and Cain will not recive the Priesthood or salvation until<br/>
all the seed of Abel are redeemed.</p>

<p>Any man having one drop of the seed<br/>
of Cain in him cannot hold the Priesthood and if no other <br/>
Prophet ever spake it before I will say it now in the name<br/>
of Jesus Christ. I know it is true and others know<br/>
it.</p>

<p>The Nero<strike>e</strike> cannot hold one particle of government<br/>
but the day will come when all the seed of Cain will be<br/>
redeemed and have all the blessings we have now and a great<br/>
deal more but the seed of Abel will be ahe<strike>i</strike>ad of the<br/>
seed of Cain to all eternity.</p>

<p>Let me consent to day to mingle my<br/>
seed with the seed of Cain and it will bring the same<br/>
curse upon me and it would upon any mean; and if<br/>
any man mingle his seed with the seed of Cain the<br/>
only way he could get rid of it or have salvation would<br/>
be to come forward and hae his head cut off and spill<br/>
his blood upon the ground and it would also take the<br/>
life of his children</p>",
42658.0,479,,"<p>It is said that if a man <strike>takes</strike> ^kills^ another he takes<br/>
that which he cannot give. If a man's head is cut off his life is<br/>
not destroyed nor his Spirit. That lives. His tabernacle is<br/>
destroyed. But I can make as good tabernacls as I can<br/>
destroy. If you will not believe it look at my children</p>

<p>Much blood was shed in ancient times<br/>
both of man and beast. The firstlings and best of the <br/>
flock was sacrificed on the Altar; and in some instances<br/>
many men and almost whole nations were sacrificed or put<br/>
to death because of their sins and wickedness. This was the<br/>
only way they could be saved at all.</p>

<p>If Jesus Christ had not had his blood<br/>
shed the blood that he received from his mother [[Mary (NT)|Mary]]<br/>
the world would not have been saved.</p>

<p>There is not one of the seed of old<br/>
[[Cain (OT)|Cain]] that is permitted to rule the reign over the seed of<br/>
[[Abel (OT)|Abel]] and neither you nor I can help it.</p>

<p>Those that do bear rule should do it in<br/>
righteousness. I am opposed to the present system of<br/>
slavery. The [[Negro|Negro]] should serve the seed of <br/>
[[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] but it should be done right. Dont abuse<br/>
the Negro and treat him cruel.</p>

<p>It has been argued here that many<br/>
of the Jews were [[Black|black]]. Whenever the seed of [[Judah (OT)|Judah]]<br/>
mingled with the seed Cain they lost the Priesthood and<br/>
all their blessings.</p>

<p>As an example; let the Presidency Twelve<br/>
Seventies High Priests Bishops and all the authorities say<br/>
Now we will all go and mingle with the seed of Cain<br/>
and they may have all the privelegies they want; and<br/>
we lift our hands to heaven in support of this.<br/>
That moment we lose the Priesthood and all its blessings<br/>
and we should not be redeemed until Cain was. I</p>",

<p>I trust in the Lord for light as I have heretofore done<br/>
When the minds of men are open to understand they will see things<br/>
as they are. We are subject to all the evils which there are<br/>
in the world.</p>

<p>I have thought this world as fallen as any of</p>",
42658.0,481,,"<p>the creation of God. When the Lord created the earth or any world<br/>
if they leave an exaltation they will have to experience all that we<br/>
experience. I see no reason why they should not be tempted<br/>
as we are tempted. If we are candidates for exaltation and<br/>
glory and we cannot get that exaltation and glory in any other way<br/>
then we should be reconciled to it and be satisfied to let the<br/>
Lord do with us as he pleases</p>

<p>Is there any evil upon any person or<br/>
affliction upon any nation or Kingdom that God does not permit?<br/>
There is not. We should then be faithful to God in all things<br/>
<strike>to be his secret counsellor. If necessary</strike> Why should we complain<br/>
or find fault with God about anything? We should not. See<br/>
the example of the nations of the earth. They complain<br/>
about everything and against all this Providences. There is<br/>
no proceeding of ours of act or experience but what he knows<br/>
all about</p>

<p>If it would be any satisfaction to you<br/>
I would say that God has passed through all the trails and<br/>
experience that we have. Jesus Christ has passed through<br/>
all the trials and experience the same as we. It would not<br/>
be prudent to say that the Father has not the same<br/>
experience that his Son has. He had quite as much<br/>
as his Son.</p>

<p>Let the Saints look about themselves and<br/>
see if they have as great things as they expected. When<br/>
they first received the Gospel and the Holy Ghost opened<br/>
their minds they saw that Zion was to be built up and<br/>
Israel gathered, the power of God and the Holy Ghost<br/>
to be poured out upon us. ""If we could get a place by<br/>
ourselves how faithful we would live and thank God."" Do<br/>
you have the same things that you looked for? Will<br/>
I dont know you say. This shows that somebody<br/>
has let down their watch and influenced others and they</p>",
42658.0,482,,"<p>have not lived up to their privileges</p>

<p>When we first received the Gospel we were<br/>
humble but since then the Tempter has come and we are tempted<br/>
with many things. But this is right. The Lord permits<br/>
it. We could not get glory without it.</p>

<p>Let me ask if any one is here who<br/>
went to Jackson County in 1831? The feeling was if I could<br/>
get with the Saints all y sorrow and trouble will be at an end<br/>
So it is with the Saints in England. Before we preached the <br/>
gathering to them the Lord revealed <strike>it</strike> to them that they would be<br/>
gathered. We told them not to reveal it till the time came</p>

<p>Do you have anything now that you looked<br/>
for in the beginning. If not something is the matter. You<br/>
don't do right. You dont settle this difficulty or that. But<br/>
what is the matter? You are wrong yourself. What<br/>
hinders you from praying all day or having fasting and <br/>
prayer? You have enough to eat; but the great<br/>
difficulty is when they moved to Zion they broght themselves<br/>
with them.</p>

<p>You had so many devil in you that<br/>
they trouble you. When the devil and wicked men<br/>
have afflicted and persecuted us as far as was for our<br/>
good then the Lord says stop and go no farther. But<br/>
if we take everything patiently all our afflictions will work<br/>
together for our good. But do you at the present<br/>
time have anything to mar your peace except what you<br/>
bring upon yourselves. You have privileges here but<br/>
do the people prize their privileges?</p>

<p>Why do the people go to teh Kanyons<br/>
after wood on Sunday? Why have they gone to day?<br/>
Why dont I do it? Why do I not visit my farm<br/>
or the bath house on Sunday? Because it is not right<br/>
and sets a bad example. I cannot do these things<br/>
</p>",
42658.0,483,,"<p>on the Sabbath</p>

<p>Some will take poles from his neighbours fence or<br/>
take a chain or an axe without liberty. This is wrong. There<br/>
is nothing on earth to mar our peace but our own acts. But<br/>
the great difficulty is we cannot get away from ourselves. Some<br/>
think perhaps that if they go to the Gold digings they can get<br/>
away from themselves but they cannot</p>

<p>When persecution and trials come they scord<br/>
the good seed and it dries up.</p>

<p>How are you going to get Zion. Nothing<br/>
hinders our having Zions but ourselves. We have all the<br/>
priveleges of angerls to worship God and get all blessings we<br/>
need.</p>

<p>We have to war with all devils temptations and<br/>
trials until we overcome. I will fight until I overcome<br/>
If I fall into the grave there are others who will take my<br/>
place. There are many who will fight and if needs<br/>
to will take the Sword</p>

<p>I hope all who want good principles will<br/>
hae the privilege of receiving them To day is a day of<br/>
tithing and sacrafice; to morrow comething the burning.</p>

<p>I would say that you cannot be<br/>
perfect without me nor I without you. The Providences<br/>
of God have so interwoven and identified the interest of the<br/>
children of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] together that they cannot be perfect<br/>
without each other.</p>

<p>Do you enjoy yourselves and have peace. I<br/>
have peace and no man can take it from me. If you do<br/>
not have peace and no man can take it from me. If you do<br/>
not have peace it is because you drive stakes and the Lord<br/>
will not let you do it.</p>

<p>But let the will of God be done. If<br/>
you dont enjoy Zion it is because you dont say ""Let the<br/>
will of God be done. There is nothing to take your Zion</p>",

<p>as we now see it? We can now behold the manifestation<br/>
of the Lord. He has done what we could not but we<br/>
hae an experience that teaches us to trust in the Lord</p>

<p>We should not undertake to dictate the<br/>
Lord for his work will go on. We have seen plenty<br/>
try to dictate the Lord and tr<strike>a</strike>y to build up themselves<br/>
and not this kingdom; but they soon fall and the Lord<br/>
overthrows them; but this work goes on the Gospel is<br/>
preached and all his work rolls forth</p>

<p>Let the wicked do what they please:<br/>
we have the privelege of worshiping God and being happy<br/>
I wish to dedicate all I possess unto God and praise him<br/>
and do all he requires of me</p>

<p>At the last Conference I was sick<br/>
and not able to be with you — not able to be up. I<br/>
meditated upon the State of the Church. I saw some<br/>
going to the right and some to the left: some after gold and<br/>
the riches of this life. I said I would tell the brethren<br/>
my feelings. I said I would go to work and build a<br/>
tabernacle and worship the Lord so that we would not<br/>
be driven home by a storm. I saw also that some<br/>
would say I cannot go for I must take care of my<br/>
cattle my farm my fields &amp;c; but I said I would go and<br/>
worship God as long as I wished if the whole earth sunk</p>

<p>Some delight in a fine horse farm<br/>
or house or good things of this life; but this is nothing to<br/>
you. It is good in its place. But you cannot<br/>
pray because you cannot spend time.</p>

<p>Some women cannot spend time to<br/>
have prayers. You know it is your duty to pray and<br/>
dedicate yourselves to God and your family and all you<br/>
possess</p>

say to all the world stand by: I am going to worship the Lord. Let<br/>
the dead bury the dead; but I will dedicate myself and <strike>aff</strike> family<br/>
and all I hae unto the Lord. No matter what the Lord<br/>
sets you about go at it and do it</p>

<p>There is a great change with this people<br/>
We have been sick; now are we well: We have been poor, now<br/>
are we rich, — have been distressed and mobed now we have peace.<br/>
How long will it last? As long as this people do right.</p>

<p>It ha<strike>v</strike>s been 22 years since this Church<br/>
was organized. We should serve the Lord, love the Lord<br/>
with all our hearts cease to do wrong or find fault with any<br/>
of the Saints. If they do wrong chastise them and not<br/>
hate them.</p>

<p>Are the people prepared to make a covenant<br/>
to dedicate themselves and their hearts to God from this hour?<br/>
I feel to urge all the brethren and sisters to dedicate themselves<br/>
unto the Lord.</p>

<p>If we can gain the victory and say I will<br/>
do the work of the Lord in all things; if he will make<br/>
his will known I will perform it. Not only say but<br/>
perform it and dedicate our affections unto the Lord.</p>

with to get out of difficulties. What will be done in<br/>
such a case? I will tell you what I would do.<br/>

give her away. If you have anything that is in your <br/>
way give it to the public works</p>

spirit of envy will not obey. Then unite your interest<br/>
with this kingdom for this kingdom will stand forever.<br/>
Put your interest with it so that you cannot get away and<br/>
then you will stick to the kingdom; but if your purse<br/>
of gold is in your pocket and you apostatize you may<br/>
go away but if your interest is with the church and you<br/>
do wrong you may stay until you get the Spirit of<br/>
God again and may be saved</p>

convenient as this. It will seat 2,200 persons and these<br/>
<strike>is</strike> are 2,500 persons here to day. I expect the Tabernacle<br/>
that we intend to build on this block will seat 15000<br/>
people. We never did build a house large enough to<br/>
hold the people. If we were to enclose this whole 10<br/>
acre block so that it would hold two hundred thousand<br/>
people by the time we go it done there would be enough<br/>
to fill it.</p>

<p>""The Lord is controling our affairs and does<br/>
more for us than we can do for ourselves or ask him to do for<br/>
us. The momre we are humble and will labour and<br/>
prepare for the gathering of Israel the faster they will gather.</p>

<p>""The establishment of this Tabernacle was<br/>
the result of my meditation while on a sick bed.</p>

<p>""I feel as usual to praise the Lord with all my <br/>
heart. The hand of God has been as visible in leading<br/>
this people as it was in leading Israel in teh days of [[Moses (OT)|Moses]]<br/>
Some had not faith to come on for fear of starving to death.</p>",
42658.0,490,,""">March 27th 1852</time> was laid before the Conference. The<br/>
sum total of the numerous items stood as follows:</p>

<p>Total of all $353,765.69<br/>
Yet to be accounted for 36,495 12<br/>
Property on hand 75,550 04</p>

<p>President Young remarked<br/>
""For my own satisfaction and great<br/>
consalation there has not one dollar gone into the hands of a<br/>
lawyer as in the days of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] At that time almost<br/>
every dollar had to go into the hands of lawyers and they<br/>
pro^se^cuted him all the day long. But I said I<br/>
would kill any man who sought to take me.</p>

<p>Many thought my purse reached<br/>
from eternity to eternity — that there was no end to it<br/>
We were called ""bogus makers."" Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
said we would go where we could coin the pure gold<br/>
$10 at a lick. We have done so even $20 at a<br/>
time.</p>",
42658.0,491,,"<p><time datetime=""1852-04""><u>April</u> <u>1852</u></time></p>

<p>Our brethren went to [[California|Calafornia]]. The hand of God<br/>
was in all this. They opened the gold mines and the Lord<br/>
had a design in it to see who would be tried by it. Never<br/>
did nor ever will any of the Saints go to dig gold there without<br/>
being sent without being damned by it. Mark my words.<br/>
If we go on to the devils ground we shall be left to smell<br/>
hell: we shall feel the wrath of God. If [[Brigham Young|I]] was sent there<br/>
by the Lord I would go but the Lord has not called me<br/>
to go. Many Elders in Israel some good men<br/>
have tried it and smutted themselves up so that it is<br/>
quite a question if they will ever be washed clean</p>

<p>I have said I did not think that there<br/>
was one dollar in 20 paid in tithing that had been spent<br/>
on the Public Works but it seems from the Books that there<br/>
has been about one fourth. The other 3 fourths I <br/>
have had to borrow. If I had to borrow all the monies<br/>
that is used and none assist me to pay it, it will make my<br/>
head ache</p>

<p>I have trusted the Lord and served<br/>
him all the day long and when I undertake anything I <br/>
persevere until I accomplish it. I see the difference<br/>
in trusting in God and doing business according to the<br/>
order of the world.</p>

<p>There is not one hair droped from<br/>
my head unnoticed and does God not know what I want</p>

<p>There never was a miracle only to the ignorant<br/>
It is all to be accounted for on natural principles. The<br/>
Lord will not turn <strike>w</strike>a stone and clay into gold to suit me<br/>
There is enough without it. Jesus did not make<br/>
bread out of a stone; but he had knowledge and power<br/>
and did call together the elements to make bread and<br/>
the elements into the water to make wine. ^out^ But<br/>
the Lord is not going to work a miracle to clothe us</p>",
42658.0,492,,"<p>Raise your wool and flax and spin and weave it and make it up<br/>
and not have to pay cash for every pound you use. What you<br/>
buy is hardly worth making up but what you make is strong<br/>
and will wear.""</p>

<p>In the evening the Priesthood filled the<br/>
[[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] at an early hour and was addressed by President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]. He arose and said:</p>

<p>""This is certainly a mixed congregation<br/>
of all the officers of the Church. We are to be instructed<br/>
in all things. The knowledge that is now in the midst of<br/>
this people is more than in all the world besides. All<br/>
science is in the midst of this people even if they have not learned<br/>
it as the world has.</p>

<p>I have my cagitations and views of the<br/>
affairs of this Kingdom; but I have learned that we must<br/>
work to the scribe if not we may fail in it; but if we<br/>
work in faith and confidence the Lord is apt to help us</p>

<p>I asked a favour of the Bishops to<br/>
divide the money debts in each ward that it might be paid</p>

<p>Let us contend with ourselves and dicipline<br/>
ourselves until everything within us is brought into subjection<br/>
to the law of Christ. You have been taught the first<br/>
principles of the Gospel now teach yourselves and the Church</p>

<p>Our school is the School of the Prophets<br/>
This is a school to paline and polish ourselves. And<br/>
suppose under such privilege we should indulge in evil<br/>
and neglect our families and our duty to God? All<br/>
our former sins would be upon our Heads.</p>

<p>It is for a man to commit himself<br/>
and all that he presides over unto God to do his will <br/>
and to continue to do it until he is santified</p>

<p>If your neighbour does you evil, do<br/>
not do evil to him. Bear with him and set him</p>",
42658.0,493,,"<p>right but dont quarrel with him; but be careful that you conduct yourself<br/>
well until you are prepared for the society of holy men</p>

<p>This is as I said the school of the Prophets<br/>
Our baptism is only the beginning of our work. You must<br/>
then go on the perfection. You must perform this work. Our<br/>
children understand the Gospel but do they understand the way<br/>
to govern their lives? We shall never see a day but what <br/>
we can learn. We shall not inherit the glory of God all<br/>
at once or understand all knowledge; but God teaches us<br/>
small principles to prepare us for greater ones.</p>

<p>Let us learn in this school. There aer<br/>
a great many books of education of the present day. The main<br/>
branch of our study is theology. I understand it better than<br/>
any in the world. [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] [[Enoch (OT)|Enoch]] [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] [[Aaron (OT)|Aaron]] Jesus<br/>
and the Apostles have all been in the same school in their day<br/>
and have faithfully learned that they might be perfected. They<br/>
are my brethren and will be my company; and I now tell<br/>
you if you want me to have full fellowship with you cease<br/>
speaking evil of God and all good men whether in heaven<br/>
or earth</p>

<p>When a man is in the right track he will<br/>
come and lay down anything at the feet of a brother to settle<br/>
a difficulty and rather wrong<strike> themselves</strike> himself than have a difficulty out</p>

<p>If you wanted revelation written diging gold<br/>
going to [[England|England]] or any other place. I profess to be an<br/>
Apostle. Every Apostle will have to be a revelator and<br/>
have revelations if there are thousands of them if they do their<br/>
duty and live up to their calling if not they will have to be<br/>
removed. But a man who is not an Apostle has<br/>
not power to stand at the head of the Kingdom of God,<br/>
hold the Keys of the Priesthood and build up and lead<br/>
the Church of God. The highest authority on the earth</p>",
42658.0,494,,"<p>is our Apostle.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ will have a class of men who will do all<br/>
that he requires of them. They will have the greater flory; but<br/>
those who cannot endure will have a lesser glory.""</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] delivered a discourse after the<br/>
president had closed.</p>

<p>Next day the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] was filled at 9 o'clock<br/>
and the meeting opened by prayer from Elder Wilford Woodruff who<br/>
then addressed the assembly. He was followed by [[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] Judge [[Zerubbabel Snow|Z. Snow]] and [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] and then President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] made the following remarks</p>

<p>""The subject I am at is to enlighten<br/>
the mind. It is expected we have to learn letters<br/>
With regard to the principle of education it commences<br/>
with the mother. I do not like to see mothers<br/>
attend to everything else but their children. They should<br/>
teach their children all they can for early impassions<br/>
will last persons during their lives whether they be <br/>
good or bad. I will tell  you the truth as it is<br/>
in eternity. If the child does not have good<br/>
instruction in early life it will be requird at the hand<br/>
of the mother and not at the hand of the father</p>

<p>The child will think the mother is<br/>
the best woman on earth and the mother has power to <br/>
instill into the mind of the child what she please and what<br/>
she imparts unto ^it^ <strike>them</strike> will stay with <strike>them</strike> ^it^ through life</p>

<p>Mothers should take care of their children<br/>
and not spend their time watching their husbands. It is<br/>
the duty of mothers to stay at home and take care of<br/>
their children. My duty calls me to be in the stand<br/>
I know not what my children are about or what they<br/>
are doing. They may be in the street swearing for<br/>
what I know as others do. If they should go to hell</p>",
42658.0,495,,"<p>it would be required at the hands of the mother and not at my hands<br/>
A child of mine shall not conquer me. [[Brigham Young|I]] would sooner see them<br/>
die than that they should conquer me. If any one of my<br/>
children will not follow my footsteps I will disinherit or disown<br/>
them. They shall not have part in my kingdom. I <br/>
would rather get children adopted to me who would keep the<br/>
commandments.</p>

<p>No child should rise up and teach and control<br/>
the mother; nor should woman rise up and dictate the<br/>
husband and the husband should not rise up and try to dictate<br/>
his president or the Lord.</p>

<p>Education begins with the mother to the<br/>
child. You must keep it in remembrance that the Lord<br/>
has commanded you to multiply and replenish the earth<br/>
that you may have joy and rejoicing in the day of the holy<br/>
resurrection.</p>

<p>Do you keep your minds pure and do<br/>
you pray night and day. Now pray from the time of<br/>
conception till the time of delivery that your child may be<br/>
filled with the Holy Ghost and that a noble spirit from eternity<br/>
may come into the Tabernacle and that the Holy Ghost may<br/>
rest upon the father mother and child.</p>

<p>When some speak you cannot understand<br/>
they make use of such high flown words; but when I speak<br/>
you can understand the verity in the English language</p>

<p>I would like to be with the Holy Ones who <br/>
are full of eternal light. A point of the finger or emotion <br/>
would communicate without words. When I am full of<br/>
the Holy Ghost I can see a man as well behind as<br/>
before. I can see their hearts by the Spirit of<br/>
God and know what is in them.""</p>

<p>In the afternoon one hundred were<br/>
called for to go with their teams to meet the emigrants</p>",
42658.0,496,,"<p>and some were appointed to go on foreign missions:</p>

<p>[[Thomas Lorenzo Margetts|Thomas Margetts]] to [[Italy|Italy]], [[Thomas Bagshaw Broderick|T. B. Broderick]]<br/>

<p>The Seventies held a meeting at night<br/>
on the subject of building the Seventies Hall, and they were<br/>
addressed by Joseph Young [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] Wilford<br/>
Woodruff and others.</p>

<p><u>Synopsis of An Address</u><br/>
<u>by</u><br/>
<u>President</u> <u>Young</u><br/>
<u>April</u> <u>the</u> <u>9th.</u></p>

<p>""This people are blessed with all that heart can with and<br/>
yet many are not satisfied. This is the case with some<br/>
spirits and they want things illegally.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that we should have<br/>
a Temple. It is absolutely necessary that we should have<br/>
a Temple to worship the Most High God in. A Tabernacle<br/>
is to assemble the multitude for meeting but a Temple is to<br/>
gather the Priesthood in that they may do the work of the Lord</p>

<p>Are we prepared to go and redeem our<br/>
dead? Is there a place prepared that we may go and<br/>
redeem our dead? No there is not. We give endowments<br/>
here but it is like trying to step on to the top round first</p>

<p>If we had the privelege of building<br/>
a temple our works would not be legal but we do these things<br/>
until we have time to build a temple. If we had gone on<br/>
to the top of the mountains if we had no room it would be <br/>
legal and right</p>",
42658.0,497,,"<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] says we have to make our own<br/>
heaven. The Lord cannot save us if we do not save ourselves. If<br/>
we expect to get our endowments we have got to follow the footsteps<br/>
that God has set for us to walk in and if we walk in that channel<br/>
God owns our labours and acknowledges all that is done.</p>

<p>Now all the ordinances will have to be attended to<br/>
again when we get a Temple. Yet if any one dies in faith those<br/>
ordinances will be legal; but all that live will have to do it again<br/>
and [[Brigham Young|I]] will say as a revelation that if you will not help build a <br/>
Temple and have faith in the work you will be lost.</p>

<p>A word to those who have got their endowments<br/>
We shall work as fast as we can and what we have done is<br/>
legal. If we had been in our own lands and had a right to<br/>
a temple we should not do as we now do.</p>

<p>Many have died in the faith, have been<br/>
worn out: their ordinances are legal. Those who came into<br/>
the church first and are faithful have a right to the ordinances<br/>
first.</p>

<p>I wish the people to understand that when the<br/>
Lord has anything for them they will have it; but when the<br/>
Lord has nothing for the people I don't want for them to teaze<br/>
me for what they cannot have. When there is to be a work<br/>
done I will tell you.</p>

<p>Now we shall begin to build a temple in <br/>
1853. This [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] will have to accomodate the <br/>
people until the Temple is built. If this wont answer for<br/>
the people until we build a Temple we will make a Bowery<br/>
on the North and South sides of the block.</p>

<p>At soon as the Temple is built we will<br/>
give you your endowments. If there are any who were in<br/>
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] and other places and have helped to build up<br/>
the Kindom of God in the early days we want to bless them<br/>
first; and if there is any man or child who went in the Battalion</p>",
42658.0,498,,"<p>or Pioneers come forward and get your blessings before others and<br/>
we will bless you. If you are faithful there is no blessing<br/>
in the celestial law or kingdom of God but what you will<br/>
get.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] want to be sealed to my [[John Hayden Young|father]] before I<br/>
shall be a legal heir. If I were to die and there was<br/>
not a child of mine to live to do it for me some friend<br/>
would be raised up to do it and if not my body will<br/>
soon be raise up and I should be in some Temple with<br/>
my brothren to tell them what to do</p>

<p>I can see the hearts of men and <br/>
the spirits of men. If they do try to be hid I can<br/>
see them. I see many who aspire to be first and<br/>
to be exalted above their fellows; but I can tell<br/>
you all you will be rewarded according to what you do<br/>
whether you do little or much or nothing at all.</p>

<p>Some wish to be above Brother<br/>
Brigham. Why was I not called before brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
Why does not some one ask the Lord to appoint them to<br/>
be above brother Brigham? But the Lord will laugh<br/>
at you. Such forget the Kingdom of God. The are corrupt.</p>

<p>Let every man say what can I do<br/>
to build up the Kingdom of God. Ask the mother who<br/>
is trying to do the will of God what her reward will be?<br/>
She will say I dont know but I will say if you are<br/>
faithful and satisfied with your condition in this life you<br/>
will be blessed and satisfied with your condition in the <br/>
world to come.</p>

<p>Let all strive to be satisfied with their<br/>
conditions in life and that will be a blessing to them.""</p>

<p>Other matters concerning paying our<br/>
debts &amp;c were touched upon by the President and then Elder<br/>
[[John Banks|John Banks]] followed in some interesting remarks.</p>",
42658.0,499,,""">11</time>th.</p>

<p>On the last day after an address from [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
C. Kimball]] who remarked that Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] was Chief Bishop<br/>
and had the right to choose his two councillors the Presiding<br/>
Bishop arose and said he should choose men who could assist.<br/>
Brigham Young was at the head and his councillors were inspired<br/>
of the Holy Ghost."" I select for my councillors Brigham Young<br/>
and Heber C. Kimball.""</p>

<p>Then Brother Heber C. <strike>F</strike>Kimball and <br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] laid hands upon Bishop Hunter's head and<br/>
blessed him and <strike>said</strike> ^H C Kimball said^</p>

<p>""O God the Eternal Father I ask in the name<br/>
of Jesus Christ while we lay our hands upon <strike>they head</strike> ^the head of thy servant^ that all<br/>
our words may be dictated by the Holy Ghost while we set<br/>
apart brother Hunter as a presiding Bishop. We hereby set<br/>
you apart to be a presiding Bishop and to be a judge in <br/>
Israel. We bless you with the Spirit of your office and <br/>
calling. You shall have wisdom to judge between good<br/>
and evil in all things and to be a great benefit to the house<br/>
of Israel and that they may uphold thee by their faith that<br/>
thou mayest administer in faith and righteousness and be a <br/>
great blessing to the people and administer to the poor and needy<br/>
Thou shalt have discernment like the lightning to detect the <br/>
evil and those who seek to deceive and that all may receive thy<br/>
teachings and thy work may work together for the good of all<br/>
the people: even so Amen.""</p>

<p>^Of^ <strike>To</strike> Brother Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball</p>",
42658.0,500,,"<p>said:</p>

<p>""You should be blessed and all your house and not one of them<br/>
shall be last and no man shall get between me and Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>
and Brother [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Richards]] and no man or woman shall get between the<br/>
Twelve and Presidency: if they do they will get pinched and<br/>
any man or woman who tried to get between us will be damned<br/>
They tried to prejudice [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] against us in his day and they will be<br/>
damned</p>

<p>""The Twelve are the best men that live and any<br/>
man who tries to put their feet upon their neck will get the<br/>
feet of the Twelve upon their own neck.""</p>

<p>President Young came in at this moment and brother<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] continued</p>

<p>""Do as brother Brigham tells you and all will<br/>
be right and you will not have sorrow. Follow my counsel<br/>
and you will not have sorrow. If my family would take<br/>
my counsel and had faith in me I would never have a<br/>
doctor in my family <strike>for</strike> ^but^ I have doctors here that I have faith<br/>
in <strike>but</strike> <strike>l</strike>Let me send for a doctor and they have faith in him<br/>
and not in me and then what further am I.""</p>

<p>Brother Brigham observed, ""That is true<br/>
and worthy of note.""</p>

<p>""If you are not one you are not mine saith<br/>
the Lord; but if you abide in me you will bring forth fruit<br/>
to the glory of God. When we learn this lesson our sorrows<br/>
will cease. When we get the clock off we shall be in heaven<br/>
In this house is my heaven for I am in a heavenly place<br/>
with holy men and angels."" x x x x x x x x</p>

<p>The old lion's neck is out of the yoke and<br/>
they will not put it on again for Brother Brigham shall whip<br/>
them out and they shall not whip him out nor me nor my <br/>
breathren. You shall be blessed and the earth shall bring<br/>
forth for your good and you shall be blessed in your posterity</p>",

who for many years had been trying to gather a company<br/>
around him as many other foolish men and false teachers of<br/>
the Churh had done. After the close of Smith's speech<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] made a few remark and Alfred Smith<br/>
and his wife and another person who held their sentiments<br/>
were cut off from the Church</p>

<p>On the 20th I attended a great feast<br/>
at [[South Cottonwood, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|South Cottenwood]]. President Young was taken quite<br/>

days closing on Sunday night the 10th. It was a very interesting<br/>
Conference a glorious time and the Spirit of God rested upon the people<br/>
and the Elders. On the Sunday night I went with the Twelve<br/>
to bless the Elders who were going on foreign missions and the<br/>
spirit of prophecy rested upon us while we were laying our hands<br/>
upon them.</p>

<p>On the 16th I met a company of Elders at the <br/>
Council House and spent the whole day in teaching and blessing<br/>
45 Elders who were going to the various nation of the earth<br/>
^China &amp;c see^ Brother Joseph Young and [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] assisted in blessing<br/>
the Elders. The Spirit and power of God rested upon us in<br/>
a great degree the heavens were opened unto us and our minds were<br/>
filled with visions revelations and prophecy while we sealed great<br/>
blessings upon the heads of the Elders as we were moved upon by<br/>
the Holy Ghost. We foretold to them what would befall them<br/>
by sea and by land and that they would do a great work and gather<br/>
many Saints and much wealth to Zion.</p>

of the House and [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] Parley P. Pratt [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] of the Twelve were in the Council.</p>

<p>December the 22nd the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve met in the upper room of the Council House at 6 o'clock<br/>
in the evening. There were present eleven of the Twelve<br/>
Apostles. The abs<strike>s</strike>ent member of our quorum was</p>",
42658.0,506,,"<p>[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] who had gone to Washington to preach the Gospel to the<br/>
President Senators and legislators of the nation</p>

<p>This was</p>

<p>An Important Council of Twelve Apostles</p>

<p>I never saw so many of them together before in Council. The<br/>
meeting ^opened^ by prayer from [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] the President who then made<br/>
some appropriate remarks and wished us to interchange our<br/>
hearty congratulations in acknowledging the mercy and blessings<br/>
of God</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] made happy referrence to<br/>
our vast seperation and mercipul re-union. this was the<br/>
first opportunity we had had of being together as a quorum<br/>
He felt that every member of the quorum had confidence in<br/>
each other and in the Presidency of the Church. He said</p>

<p>""I feel as though the day is not far distant when<br/>
men will stand among us in this immortal bodies holding<br/>
the keys of death and hell and that brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] would<br/>
say if he was angry with us that we had suffered enough<br/>
and that we should be numbered among his jewels.""</p>

<p>He alluded to the great work we had to perform<br/>
the building of a Temple &amp;c</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff next spoke and noted<br/>
among other things the peculiar fact that up to that date there<br/>
had never been a death in the quorum of the Twelve Apostles<br/>
of this dispensation except in the case of [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]] who<br/>
fell a martyr for his religion according to the special request<br/>
that he made of the Lord that he might die that death. But<br/>
the rest of the quorum of the Twelve had stood in the front of<br/>
the battle and danger for the last twenty years. He refered to<br/>
the great prosperity and work of the Twelve abroad among<br/>
the nations and rejoiced that the Lord had preserved them to</p>",
42658.0,507,,"<p>return from the four corners of the earth to again sit in council together<br/>
in Zion.</p>

<p>[[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] followed. He had known the quorum of the<br/>
Twelve from the beginning since they were first together in his father's house<br/>
since his absence to Denmark on mission he had learnt how to appreciate<br/>
the society of home and his brethren, &amp;c.</p>

<p>[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] said we were at liberty to prophesy while<br/>
together as moved upon by the Holy Ghost and if we did not feel to<br/>
prophesy to speak by faith and it should be fulfilled. He had unlimited<br/>
confidence in every member of the Twelve and the Presidency and<br/>
prophesied in the name of God that we should all meet and<br/>
come forth in the first resurrection and receive our crowns in<br/>
the celestial Kingdom"" which was confirmed by a good Amen<br/>
by all the quorum.</p>

<p>[[John Whittaker Taylor|<u>John</u> <u>Taylor</u>]] next spoke and referred to the changes<br/>
among the nations and said that the ^doors^ was near when Kings would <br/>
seek counsel at our hands. ""In the beginning the Elders<br/>
went out ignorant ment now they are full of intelligence<br/>
and the nations of the earth will feel their influence.""<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] was delighted with the<br/>
occasion and rejoiced to see the union of the quorum and their<br/>
dispositions to do right. "" We dont have to feel that [[Lyman Wight|Lyman<br/>
Wight]] is drawing off one way [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] another and [[William Smith|W<u>m</u><br/>
Smith]] committing iniqiuty and we forced to sustain them<br/>
against our feelings. I have the satisfaction of believing<br/>
that each member of the quorum <u>was</u> is doing right and I<br/>
rejoice that the quorum have been able to publish the Gospel<br/>
in six different languages and to gather the people together. He<br/>
hoped we should meet once a week and with the Presidents<br/>
offer our Prayers; felt a proud satisfaction in being associated<br/>
with 10 men whom he believed ^possessed^ the most intelligence of any<br/>
men upon the earth and believed the prophesies of that evening<br/>
would be fulfilled. He closed with his blessing upon us.</p>",
42658.0,508,,"<p>Among other remarks [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] said He had<br/>
found out what that love and affection for his brethren is that surpasses<br/>
the love of woman for he had a confidence in his quroum far greater<br/>
than in his wives and children, for his brethren had been brought up<br/>
in the hard school of experience and had been tried in all things and<br/>
proven true and I have been proven with them. I am wedded to<br/>
my quorum with all my interest. I go when I am sent and come<br/>
when I am called and so expect to continue to do. My interest<br/>
is insepera<strike>tely</strike>belly connectd with this Kingdom and I trust ever will<br/>
be through time and eternity.</p>

<p>[[Charles Coulson Rich|C. C. Rich]] expressed his feelings and said, ""on<br/>
my way home I had a dream. I thought the ancients in their<br/>
resurrected bodies were associated with us in this place. I have<br/>
the most unbounded faith in the quorum of the Twelve and in<br/>
the First Presidency. I hope the Winter Season may be<br/>
profitable to us in our associations and that we may improve <strike>our</strike><br/>
out time.""</p>

<p>[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] next spoke and among a member<br/>
of remarks said<br/>
""If the First Presidency were to be removed the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve would have to preside and if they had<br/>
not the fulness of the girst they would not be fit to preside<br/>
I feel exceedingly thankful to be associated with such men. I<br/>
have not language to express my feelings when I was first<br/>
called to be an Apostle in this quorum. I could not sleep<br/>
for three days and nights. I feel now as though I could<br/>
break a nation to pieces. I felt renovated with the<br/>
Holy Spirit while [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] was speaking. No blessing<br/>
is too great or too good for us and we shall possess them<br/>
all.""</p>

<p>[[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] said his sentiments<br/>
were shadowed forth in his labours. I have great joy<br/>
in meeting with you am beholding your faces and contemplating.</p>",
42658.0,509,,"<p>the influence and power of this quorum and the greatness of their work<br/>
I anticipate much this Winter in our meetings and in enjoying the<br/>
blessing of God. I have rejoiced this night to hear the exalted expressions<br/>
of the quorum in rendering than<strike>k</strike>sgiving to God and not one word<br/>
of complaint of hardships inprisonments or afflictions of any kind<br/>
but we are filled with hidden joy and peace. I feel determined<br/>
to do all that is asigned me that I may be worthy a place in<br/>
this quorum. I felt grateful to hear the blessings pronounced<br/>
upon us by our President.""</p>

<p>He closed with joy and thanksgiving.<br/>
Wilford Woodruff next addressed the quorum upon<br/>
the importance of their keeping private histories of their<br/>
lives labours and ministry and also a joint history of the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He said since he had been<br/>
a member of the Church he had been inpired not only to write<br/>
all his own acts and life but to write the sermons teachings<br/>
and prophesies of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] , President [Brigham Young|Young] and council<br/>
and of the Twelve Apostles as far as he was acquainted with<br/>
their labours. He said each member of the quorum should keep an account of his own mission works miracles and the <br/>
blessings of God unto him and that the history of the Twelve<br/>
Apostles could now be easily obtained; but if we omitted<br/>
it until we are dead our friends could not get it correctly<br/>
before the world.</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] spoke of the filling up of <br/>
the quorum of the Twelve in 1848 and of their commencing a <br/>
record of the Twelve Apostles and wished it continued. He<br/>
did not know how far and minute we ought to be but<br/>
thought we ought to record our official acts and considered it<br/>
for our interest as well as a duty thus to do.</p>

<p>[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] said President [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] wished<br/>
him to request the younger members of the quorum to hand<br/>
to him a short statement of their lives and ministry to go</p>",
42658.0,510,,"<p>into the Church History.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] Wilford Woodruff and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P<br/>
Pratt]] interchanged a few words upon the subject of Journal keeping</p>

<p>[[Franklin Dewey Richards|<u>Franklin </u>D. <u>Richards</u>]] next spoke and said I feel<br/>
behind most of the quorum in not having the privilege of so much<br/>
teaching and counsel from brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] as they have. When I<br/>
contemplate the future I feel that the field of our labour is equal <br/>
to the noblest ambition which man could entertain both in this<br/>
world and the next. He felt hisjoy tempered in the recolection</p>

<p>[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] said:</p>

<p>""While I have been listening I have<br/>
had an unusual train of reflection. Of necessity we shall<br/>
soon be called again to seperate and the Kingdoms of this world<br/>
must become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ. We<br/>
are trained in the school of experience. I may live to see you <br/>
all in different parts of the earth and while the Kingdoms of<br/>
the earth are falling you will in many instances be enable<br/>
to stre<strike>dr</strike>ch out your hands and give counsel and save many<br/>
people and be enabled to rule governments and thus fulfill the<br/>
prophecies. Many of these things are not afar off. All<br/>
is eternity to us whether this or the other side of the veil<br/>
We are born in eternity and let us be where we will it will<br/>
be our calling to win souls unto Christ. The Presidency<br/>
are unwell or they would be here. I wish the Journals<br/>
of the Twelve to be written up so that they can be on hand<br/>
when needed to be published. I wish each one of the <br/>
quorum to write as good an epistle as he can and have<br/>
the whole put in a book form and sent forth into the world""</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt thought the subject abounded<br/>
in us. ""We owe the world a testimony not as individuals<br/>
but as a quorum of the Twelve Apostles""</p>

<p>He suggested that each should contribute<br/>
an epistle and from the whole compile and embody a book</p>",
42658.0,511,,"<p>to go forth with the signatures of all the quorum as the combined ""<u>History</u><br/>
of the <u>Twelve</u> <u>Apostles</u></p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|<u>George</u> <u>A.</u> <u>Smith</u>]] thought it very important that<br/>
an authentic history of eah member should be preserved.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff mentioned certain items which he<br/>
considered necessary in the preservation of our history. He lamented<br/>
that [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]] had not left any record of his life for he was a<br/>
Prophet and an Apostle and a mighty man. Many miracles were<br/>
wrought by him. He told a rich man in Tennessee who fought<br/>
the work of God that he and his family should beg their bread. [[Robert C. Petty|Robert<br/>
C. Petty]] saw that same man cry at a blaksmith's shop because<br/>
he could not get trusted to have his plough sharpened""</p>

<p>President [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] moved that Wilford Woodruff<br/>
be the cleark and historian of the Twelve Apostles. Carried<br/>
unanimously</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] proposed a new reord and wished that<br/>
the Narative of each of the quorum of the Twelve be first recorded<br/>
in it beginning with the President and going through with each<br/>
member in order as he stands in the quorum</p>

<p>W. Woodruff said he was willing to serve the<br/>
quorum as its historian as faithfully as he could through it would<br/>
be a heavy tax on his time.</p>

<p>[[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] enquired if the History<br/>
contemplated is to be confined to the present quorum or the members<br/>
from the beginning</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt throught it should merely include<br/>
the present quorum.</p>

<p>Erastus Snow would like to see included all<br/>
that could be found of David W. Patten</p>

<p>[[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] observed that the morning of<br/>
the day when David Patten was martyred he said the Kingdom<br/>
of God should be delivered or he should lay down his life</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt wished brother Woodruff</p>",
42658.0,512,,"<p>to leave all temporal business as much as possible and bring this<br/>
History up.</p>

<p>[[Amasa Mason Lyman|A. Lyman]] said there was no date of his ordination</p>

<p>[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] proposed for the Twelve to meet with<br/>
the Presidency and also to meet each week for a mutual exchange<br/>
of thought.</p>

<p>We then adjourned to meet at the same place one week from that date</p>

<p>On the 29 of Dec the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
met and spent the evening upon conversation upon some plan for<br/>
liberating ourselves and families so that we could be foot-loose<br/>
to go and preach the Gospel</p>

<p>On the last day of <time datetime=""1852-12"">Dec 1852</time> I looked over<br/>
my Journal and made up the following</p>

<p>I wrote in my Journal at the time</p>

<p><u>My Reflections on the New Year.</u></p>

<p>A new year in the midst of a new era! Oh how<br/>
time flies and how great how important how magnificent are the <br/>
events b<strike>ro</strike>orne on its wings. It is the opening of a dispensation<br/>
that swallows up all other dispensations since the world began<br/>
The deeds of the last thousand years sink into insignificence in<br/>
comparison to the work of the present time</p>

<p>The heavens gaze upon the scenes as<br/>
they pass with deep interest while the whole earth behold the<br/>
scenes in wonder and amazement. The ancient Prophets saw<br/>
by vision and revelation the scenes which were to follow each<br/>
other in quick succession in this age in the establishment of the<br/>
great Kingdom of God to be thrown down no more forever. The<br/>
little stone cut out of the mountain without hands which was to<br/>
roll forth until it became a mountain and filled the whole earth</p>",
42658.0,515,,"<p>1853<br/>
breaking in pieces and subduing all other kingdoms and itself to stand forever<br/>
as seen by the Prophet [[David (OT)|David]] has commenced its work.</p>

<p>That Church and Kingdom of God is now on the <br/>
earth and is being established and must endure. The world are gazing<br/>
upon it, located in these valleys of the mountains like a City set upon <br/>
a hill which cannot be hid.  Its first Prophet and founder has laid<br/>
down his life in its defence. He has been martyred and his blood<br/>
is crying from the ground for vengeance upon a great nation. Many<br/>
others have fallen martyrs to the truth and the Gospel of Jesus Christ<br/>
since the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ in A. D. 1830 -<br/>
and many more may; yet the Church is bound to rise and prosper<br/>
until the Zion and Kingdom of our God shall stand forth in bold<br/>
relief with all that power might majesty and dominion which God<br/>
has declared concurring her and which has been spoken through the<br/>
mouths of his holy Prophets since the world began</p>

<p>This Church and Kingdom has continued<br/>
steadily to arise since its first organization amid opposition oppression<br/>
persecution and martyrdom until it has become established in the midst<br/>
of the ""everlasting hills"" not only gaining strength in Church but <br/>
also in State</p>

<p>[[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]]s nobles are of himself and his Governor<br/>
has proceeded out of the midst of him. And while truth inspires<br/>
my heart shall I feelt to write it? Shall I feer that the <br/>
present or future generations may read these truths which are<br/>
burning in my breast unkindled by the atlars of heaven? No<br/>
God forbid! for the voice of truth whispers to me that our Governors<br/>
Presidents and Senators now arising out of the Kingdom of God will<br/>
be inspired to take bold measures perform during acts and in their<br/>
strength and power stretch forth their strong arm and save <strike>from</strike><br/>
annihilation that holy instrument _ the Constitution of the United<br/>
States which the ^American^ people are about to sell for a mess of pottage<br/>
and try to consign it to the grave; but there is a power who <br/>
has decreed that liberty freedom and the rights of the meek of the</p>",
42658.0,516,,"<p>Earth shall not wholly die; and that power is God. He has decreed to<br/>
inspire and nerve up the soul the sinew and the own of his governors<br/>
senators and Prophets and own them for the contest and defend them<br/>
in their warefare. That nation or Kingdom or tongue or people<br/>
from this time forth who shall rise up against Zion - the Church and<br/>
Kingdom of God - to oppress her shall be visited by the judgements<br/>
of the Most High and be overthrown and brought to desolation<br/>
and may God spedily hasten it. May the Almighty begin<br/>
this year to rend the Kingdoms of this world with his servants<br/>
and continue it until all nations shall acknowledge there is<br/>
a God in Israel.""</p>

<p>On the 1st day of the new year the Quorum of the <br/>
Twelve Apostles met at the Council House at 8 o'clock being eleven<br/>
in number: [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] was absent in Washington</p>

<p>The quorum marched to President [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]]'s and wished him a happy new year. President Young<br/>
received them with joy and gladness and aftre the greetings<br/>
were over he asked us what he should treat us <strike>to</strike>with. The<br/>
sentiment was instantaneous in the hearts of all the quorum<br/>
and spoken by President [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]: ""Treat us with your<br/>
blessing.""</p>

<p>Then President Young blessed the quorum of the<br/>
Twelve Apostles and said they always had his blessing; and<br/>
the Twelve felt and realized that the blessings of the Presidency<br/>
of the Church and Kingdom of God was of far more worth and<br/>
benefit to them than any earthly gift or the treasures of the<br/>
earth and their hearts were full of joy and gladness.</p>

<p>The Twelve left their blessings upon President<br/>
Young and his house. While they were paying their respects<br/>
to him the band was playing a lively tune in the front of<br/>
the house. The quorum saluted the two bands with a<br/>
happy new year and received in return some escellent music</p>",
42658.0,517,,"<p><br/>
The quorum of the Twelve next visited President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C.<br/>
Kimball]] and wished him a happy New Year and he also received them<br/>
with gladness and gave unto them his blessing which was also highly prized<br/>
In his blessing unto them he said his faith and feelings were that no<br/>
one of the present quorum of Apostles should ever fall and no power should<br/>
take their crown and Kingdom; but they should come forth in the morning<br/>
of the first resurrection and be exalted to glory immortality and eternal<br/>
lives. Their blessings should increase from that time hencforth<br/>
and forever and they should not want bread but they should have means<br/>
to support themselves and families.""</p>

<p>The Twelve left their blessings upon President<br/>
Kimball and then visited Father [[John Smith, b. 1832|John Smith]] the aged Patriarch of the<br/>
Church and wished him a happy new year. He manifested much<br/>
joy and satisfaction in seeing eleven of the Twelve Apostles beneath<br/>
his roof. This venerable Patriarch also bestowed upon the Twelve<br/>
his blessing and said they should live to see the Kingdom of God<br/>
and Zion established to be thrown down no more forever and that<br/>
none of them should ever fall but they should have part in the<br/>
first resurrection. No power should take their crowns but<br/>
they should be blessed in all their labours in the earth and the<br/>
blessings of God should increase upon them from that time<br/>
forth both temporal and spiritual.</p>

<p>The Apostles also left their blessings upon<br/>
the Patriarch and his household and next visited President [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]<br/>
who received them in like manner and was saluted by them<br/>
with the happy new year. He also gave the Twelve his<br/>
blessing. He believed this the beginning of an eventful year<br/>
in the history of this Church and that each succeeding one would<br/>
be more and more so until the Coming of the Son of Man. He<br/>
said the Twelve were ever before him in his thoughts prayers and<br/>
blessings notwithstanding they might be scattered to the four corners<br/>
of the earth. They were men of God and were destined<br/>
to perform a great and mighty work upon the earth and they</p>",
42658.0,518,,"<p>should live till they were satisfied with life and see light and truth prevail<br/>
over sin and tradition.""</p>

<p>The Twelve then went to the house of Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]]<br/>
and there united with his family in singing the ""Return of the Twelve""<br/>
and other songs of Zion. The spirit and power of God rested upon <br/>
them and their hearts were filled with praise and thanksgiving to<br/>
God in all their visits of this the new year of 1853.</p>

<p>The bands continued their salutations throughout<br/>
the city and their enliveing music was everywhere received with open<br/>
ears and hearts of joy.</p>

<p>Dedication of Social Hall</p>

<p>During the evening the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
with the Presidency and about 200 of the Saints met with our families<br/>
at the Social Hall and dedicated it to the purpose for which it<br/>
was built after which they went forth in the dance finishing<br/>
their enjoyments of this new year's day.</p>

<p>Sunday the 2nd Bro [[Joseph Toronto|Joseph Toronto]] gave an<br/>
account of his travels through [[Italy|Italy]] and the dangers he ran in<br/>
preaching the Gospel to his native country. He was among the<br/>
Waldensees</p>

<p>On the following Sunday after an interesting<br/>
discourse ^from P. P. Pratt^ brother Groward gave an interesting account of his<br/>
mission on the Western Islands - of his travels among the natives,<br/>
his sufferings among them, and the opposition by the French<br/>
Government. He was 9 years on his mission and several <br/>
years without hearing anything from the Church and his mental<br/>
sufferings were very great. The first he received was a letter<br/>
I wrote to him and that he did not obtain until two years after<br/>
it was written.</p>

<p>On the Sunday Jan 2nd President [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] met with the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
and the same subject was brought up and talked over as on the 29<br/>
of December. President Young said the best way for the Twelve<br/>
to get a living for themselves and families was to preach the</p>",
42658.0,519,,"""><u>Feburary the 14th 1853</u></time></p>

<p>This was an important day to the Saints in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]]<br/>
and even in all the world.</p>

<p>The Saints met upon the Temple Block in a <br/>
vast body to break the ground for another ^Temple^. The people commenced<br/>
gathering at ane arly hour and at eleven o'clock there were thousands</p>",
42658.0,520,,"<p>upon the ground. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and Council the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
and many of the quorums of the Church were there and all the bands of music<br/>
in the City were in attendance.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock President Brigham Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
C. Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] got into a buggy inside the square<br/>
surrounded by the quorum of the Twelve. President Young then<br/>
arose and addressed the assembly upon the subject of building Temples<br/>
I recorded it in my journal but it is published in the Journal of Discourses<br/>
Vol I[1].</p>

<p>After the address of President Young Heber C. Kimbell<br/>
arose and with uplifted hands to heaven offered up a fervant heart:felt<br/>
prayer to God imploring his blessing upon President Young and his <br/>
Councillors and all the authorities of the Church with the whole house<br/>
of Israel. He then dedicated the ground unto God and prayed<br/>
for his blessings to attend them in building the Temple and all the<br/>
public works in Zion.</p>

<p>At the close of the prayer the Presidency and Twelve<br/>
walked to the South East corner of the ground laid out for the Temple<br/>
The earth being frozen President Heber C. Kimball commenced breaking<br/>
the ground with a pick. Then President Richards did the same<br/>
and then [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] Wilford Woodruff [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]<br/>
[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lymon]] [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]] [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] [[Erastus Snow|Erastus<br/>
Snow]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D. Richards.]]  Then the gound was broke<br/>
and President Brigham Young took out the first turf<strike>f</strike> and while<br/>
taking it out a silver dollar from some one in the congregation was<br/>
thrown which struck in the hole. Brother Kimball said that<br/>
was our omen that we should have plenty of money to build the<br/>
Temple with.</p>

<p>[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] was at this time at Washington and <br/>
[[George Albert Smith| A Smith]] at [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]] but all the rest of the Twelve were present<br/>
at the breaking of the ground for the Temple.</p>

<p>As soon as the turf was taken out the<br/>
congregation was dismissed and the people rushed to the hole to get</p>",

<p>The General Conference commenced this morning and<br/>
it was one of the most interesting ever held by the Church since<br/>
its organization.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the day was afterwards published<br/>
in the Deseret News and copied from thence into the L. D. Saints<br/>
Millennial Star and therefore I shall not record it here. I <br/>
will say however that the four corner stones of the Temple</p>",
42658.0,522,,"<p>were laid in [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] on this day</p>

<p>The Presidency laid the South East corner stone<br/>
with the Patriarch; Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Edward Hunter]] and Council with the<br/>
lesser Priesthood laid the South West Corner stone; John Young<br/>

<p>There was a prayer offered on each corner<br/>

<p>The proceedings occupied until 2 o'clock<br/>
After the laying of the North East Corner Stone by the Twelve<br/>

heaven to encircle you in the arms of his love and mercy<br/>

<p>The procession then returned to the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] <br/>
and were dismissed by President Young until 3 o'clock</p>

<p>President Brigham Young delivered a very<br/>
interesting discourse in the afternoon which is published. Brother<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] said that the Seventies had a portion of all the Apostleship<br/>
to had all the Elders but none were ordained to the fulness of</p>",
42658.0,523,,"<p>the Apostleship except the Twelve or those who are ordained to that office.</p>

<p>[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] told a dream. He said that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
came to him and told him to dip a large lake dry and gave him a<br/>
spoon to do it with. He said he thought he could have no impression<br/>
upon it with a spoon but still he would obey counsel and he went<br/>
dipping and soon had lowered the lake five feet. Then Joseph told<br/>
him he could not always judge of things by appearances but the<br/>
Lord would do all for us that our hearts could desire.</p>

<p>On the 7th the Conference was called to order by <br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] who presented to us a text _ a set of fire irons made by the<br/>
brethren from the native iron in [[Iron County, Utah Territory|Iron County]].</p>

<p>[[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin Clapp]] arose and made confession that <br/>
he had been in darkness and had done wrong in many things. He<br/>
desired to be forgiven and retained in the Church. He was forgiven</p>

<p>The authorities of the Church were presented and<br/>
sustained.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] was called upon to preach an iron sermon<br/>
He took one of the fire irons made from native iron and swung<br/>
it round his head and cried out stereotyped edition and then <br/>
descended amidst the cheers of the congregation.</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] read his oration<br/>
delivered on the corner stone of the Temple and also preached his sermon<br/>
of that day published in the Deseret News.</p>

<p>After dismissing the meeting the Presidency and<br/>
others met in the vestry and [[James Allred|James Alread]] [[Asahel Perry|Aschel Perry]] and<br/>
[[Charles Walker Hyde|Charles Walker Hyde]] were ordained Patriarchs under the hands<br/>
of Presidents Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Richards]]</p>

<p>The meeting being opened on the following<br/>
day President Kimball arose and said we have a number chosen to<br/>
go on missions and then 23 names were given and set apart<br/>
to their different stations in Europe and five to other parts of the<br/>
world. Their names are published in the ""News"".</p>

<p>On the 31st of July President [[Brigham Young|Young]] preached a discourse upon<br/>
the subject of our Indian war for we had had a war with [[Chief Walker|Walker]] and his<br/>
band for about three weeks. The Saints were gathering in out of the<br/>
small settlements and fortifying themselves.<br/>
Two brethren had been killed<br/>
and three wounded and 10 Indians killed as supposed.</p>

<p><u>Special Conference of the Church</u></p>

<p>It conviened Saturday the 13th of August and continued over the<br/>
Sunday. I did not record the minutes in my Journal</p>

<p>On the 19th I baptized brother and sister Rose and confirmed<br/>
them.</p>

<p>On the 25th I rode in company with Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] to<br/>
Weber and spent the night with him.</p>

<p><u>Locating the [[Weber River, Utah Territory|Weber Settle<strike>m</strike>nient]]</u></p>

<p>I was sent by President [[Brigham Young|Young]] to locate the fort for the inhabitants as<br/>
they could not agree among themselves. They had moved it several<br/>
times and still were disatisfied.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival I rode throughout<br/>
the Weber Settlement on both sides of the river examining the whole of the <br/>
country and collected the whole people together at 12 o'clock. I preached to<br/>
them 2 hours and heard them talk two hours more. I then<br/>
established the fort on the South side of the river in the midst<br/>
of the farming lands. I was weary and spent the night at Brother<br/>
Kingtons.</p>

<p>Next day I left Weber and rod to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]]<br/>
through hard rain showers. I then mounted a<strike>g</strike> horse and rode to<br/>
[[John Benbow|John Benbows]] on Cottonwood and spent the night with him. [[William Benbow|William<br/>

<p>The Conference lasted from the 6th until the 9th during which time<br/>
much business was done. Many missionaries were chosen to go<br/>
to the Lamanites and to various places besides and much instruction<br/>
was given by the Presidency and Twelve. All the proceedings<br/>
are published in the Deseret News. I received a mission in<br/>
connection with [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]] for the settlement of [[Tooele, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Toella]].<br/>
We were to pick but fifty families to settle that place. President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] gave an address to the missionaries which I reported<br/>
and gave him.</p>

<p>Sunday Nov the 14th the Twelve met with the <br/>
company of Elders who were appointed to go to [[Green River, Sweetwater County, Wyoming Territory|Green River]] to establish<br/>
a station at that place. We blessed them and set them apart<br/>
for the work. They were addressed by Wilford Woodruff and<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]. This was the second company for that place<br/>
making in all 90 men.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 16th day of Nov I<br/>
met with the Regency upon whom the Presidency had called<br/>
to get up a new alphabet and make an imrovement in the English<br/>
language. The Regency had sat several evenings for that purpose</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt had commenced a Spanish<br/>
school and I was attending it to learn the language.</p>

<p>On the 20th in company with [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]]<br/>
and Dr. [[Woodville Morris Andrews|Andrews]] I rode to [[Tooele, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Toella City]] and spent the night at <br/>
Bishop [[John Rowberry|Robery's]].</p>

<p>New day was Sunday and we tode to</p>",
42658.0,527,,"<p>[[Willow Creek, Utah Territory|Willow Creek]] settlement and held a meeting with the people. I spoke to them<br/>
and was followed by [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]].</p>

<p>There were about one hundred men in this settlement<br/>
and they were beginning to fort up; and there were also about one hundred<br/>
friendly Indians. All settlements were counselled to life in forts<br/>
until they could wall in their cities. [[Thomas Clark|Thomas Clark]] was the Bishop<br/>
and we duined with him.</p>

<p>From Willow Creek on the same day I rode back<br/>
to [[Tooele, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Toella City]] and preached to a large congregation and on the following<br/>
day I returned to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] but stoped on the way and appointed <br/>
a cite for a new fort and city.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 4th of December the mail came<br/>
in bringing good news from the Elders and tidings that war was <br/>
proclaimed between [[Russia|Russia]] and [[Turkey, Ottoman Empire|Turkey]].</p>

<p>Sunday the 11th President [[Brigham Young|Young]] addressed the people<br/>
and I reported it and prepared it for the Press.</p>

<p>On Monday the 12th the Legislative Assembly<br/>
commenced its sessions and next day both houses in joint session<br/>
received the [[Brigham Young|Governor]] and his Message. I was one of the members<br/>
of the House.</p>

<p>Christmas day was on a Sunday. [[Hosea Stout|Hosea Stout]]<br/>
who had just returned from his mission to China addressed the congregation.<br/>
on the Chinees, their religion customs and pursuits including the<br/>
revolution among them at the time. In the afternoon [[Claudius Victor Spencer|Claudius<br/>

the evening I met with the 14th Ward and addressed the people<br/>
upon the subject of education and our duties to our children.</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day I met with <br/>
the 14th Ward and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]] delivered an address upon education<br/>
which I reported and spent the 30th in writing and preparing it.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Frandklin D. Richards]]<br/>

Saints. The spirit of murmering and rebellion<br/>
of which I have already spoken in a former page<br/>
had not slept but had been brewing in the family<br/>
circle in the secret chamber and in the street until<br/>
many and some in high places had risen up<br/>
against [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] who^m^ God raised up to lead Israel<br/>
and they were striving to overthrow his influence and<br/>
cast him down. This grieved the spirit of the<br/>
Prophet to find such perils among false brethren</p>",

me to take the hands of the Saints in Kirtland in parting from<br/>
them to go into the vin^e^yard to proclaim the word of God. I<br/>
accordingly took my farewell of Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] my companion<br/>
and sister [[Olive Boynton Hale|Hale]] who were expecting to tarry together for a <br/>
season. I then left Kirtland in good spirits in company<br/>
of Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] and having walked to [[Fairport, Geauga County, Ohio|Fairport]] a distance of</p>",
42828.0,106,,""">day</time> which was Sunday we<br/>
walked from Syracuse to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] Oswego Co. N. Y.<br/>
where I was again blessed with the privilege of taking<br/>
by the hand my brethren after the flesh—namely,<br/>
[[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] and [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson Woodruff]]. I had not seen<br/>
either of them for three years. I found my cousin<br/>
<strike>Elad</strike> [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1812|^Eldad^ Woodruff]] with them.</p>

<p>There was something of a coldness<br/>
manifested by my family relatives towards myself<br/>
and the two brethren in the Church who accompanied<br/>
me. This was because of our religion and This coldness<br/>
was especially shown by [[Elizabeth Norton Hart Woodruff|Elizabeth]] my brother's wife</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that it was against<br/>
the principles of my brother's family to receive us for<br/>
the night we were permitted to sup with them and<br/>
one of my former neighbours Mr [[Walter Menter|Walter Menter]] gave<br/>
us a place to lay our heads for the night which we<br/>
gladly accepted.</p>

<p>I called in the morning at my brother<br/>
Azmon's and conversed with him and also my brother<br/>
Thompson upon temporal and spiritual subjects. Neither<br/>
of them manifested any hardness towards me in the<br/>
morning but both appeared affected. Brother Azmon<br/>
said he was still seeking for light and truth and should<br/>
not have left the Church of Latter-day Saints had it not<br/>
been for his trials and temptations &amp;c.</p>

<p>Having commended them to God I took the<br/>
parting hand of my brethren and their household feeling<br/>
perhaps that it might be the last time that I should see<br/>
them in the flesh. I left with some painful sensations<br/>
and a firm belief that there would be some change in their<br/>
household which presentiment I expressed to my brother<br/>
Azmon. In my heart I prayed the Lord's mercy upon<br/>
my brethren—kinsmen after the flesh but I ^could^ not say<br/>

and James Blakesley at the township of Bastard.</p>

<p>The Conference consisted of 13 Elders 5 Priests<br/>
8 Teachers and 6 Deacons besides a large congregation<br/>
of Saints.</p>",

conference then proceeded to business.</p>

<p>There were eight Branches of the Church represented<br/>
consisting of 300 members in all. Thirty two brethren were<br/>
presented for ordination and Elder [[William Draper|William Draper]] and myself<br/>
were called upon to ordain them. We then ordained <br/>
7 Elders 9 Priests 11 Teachers and 5 Deacons. This with<br/>
some other matters filled up the business of the day.<br/>
Meeting then closed and I accompanied several brethren to<br/>
Elder [[Sylvester B. Stoddard|Stodard's]] where we spent the <strike>day</strike> ^night^.</p>

<p>The conference was continued on the next<br/>
day and I was called upon to address the congregation<br/>
in the morning service. It was with peculiar feelings<br/>
that I arose to address a large body of Saints in the<br/>
capacity of Conference raised up in another nation seperate<br/>
from my own and under another Government. This<br/>
was the first time that I had ever addressed a congregation<br/>
of Saints under the British rule. I preached<br/>
from the ##2Corinthians 4:3-4|2<sup>nd</sup> Cor. IV, ch 3<sup>rd</sup> &amp; 4th## verses.</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Lord was with us and<br/>
we were blessed. After I closed the Saints spake in<br/>
tongues and prophesied. Five presented themselves for<br/>
baptism which was administered unto them by Elder<br/>
[[John Edward Page|Page]] thus was added others to our number.</p>

<p>After an intermission Elder Page addressed<br/>
us upon the Priesthood and bore a strong testimony to<br/>
the people. Our Conference then closed by our returning<br/>
thanks to God.</p>

<p>We took the parting hand of many brethren<br/>
and sisters and I returned with several Elders to brother<br/>
Stodard's to spend the night.</p>

<p>At his house there was a woman presented<br/>
who was often possessed with the devil. She was oft times<br/>
dumb and greatly afflicted by evil spirits that dwelt in her.<br/>
She beleived in Jesus Christ of [[Nazareth, Israel|Nazareth]] and in us as his servants<br/>
and called upon us to cast the devil out of her.</p>

<p>According to this woman's request four of<br/>
us [[laying on of hands|laid our hands]] upon her and commanded the devil<br/>
in the name of Jesus Christ to depart out of her and<br/>

short interview with Mr [[Alpha Sage|Alpha Sage]] I spend the remainder<br/>
of the day with Eunice whom I accompanied to her<br/>
school and spent a very interesting time. As the scene<br/>
and reflections of the time affected me much as well as</p>",
42828.0,111,,"<p>interesting me with the associations of home and family recolections<br/>
I will here give from my journal a discription written at the time of</p>

<p><u>My Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]]</u><br/>
<u>Teaching School.</u></p>

<p>I entered the [[Rock School, Colebrook, Litchfield County, Connecticut|school]] taught by my Sister Eunice at 1 o'clock<br/>
<strike>a</strike>^p^.m. Five hours I spent within its walls watching my sister<br/>
in the performance of her school duties and in perusing letters written<br/>
to her by my brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]]. Five years before when I last<br/>
beheld Eunice at our [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house she was only a child of twelve<br/>
years of age; but in the scene before me I now beheld her an<br/>
instructoress of youth. As I looked up^on^ her—my only sister<br/>
teaching the youth and showing accomplishments that grace the female<br/>
sex varied reflections passed through my mind and emotion of strong<br/>
affection moved me. There she appeared before me (only seventeen<br/>
years of age) adorned with youth modesty and loveliness</p>

<p>With a degree of admiration I gazed upon her and marked the<br/>
change five years had <strike>brought upon her</strike> ^produced^. Her spirit was ^blythe^ blithful<br/>
and her step as she moved among her pupils showed the energy<br/>
of youth</p>

<p>As if to call my mind more perfectly to the<br/>
recollections of home and past scenes Eunice with a cheerful grace<br/>
presented me with the bundle of letters from our brother Asahel<br/>
They were fifteen in number and addressed to my sister. As<br/>
I read them through they filled my soul with emotion and brought<br/>
as great a variety of feelings as the matter they contained. They<br/>
showed the cultivated mind and refined talents of a brother writing<br/>
to a sister with the purest spirit and deepest feeling for her<br/>
welfare. Such teachings as those to Eunice if followed by<br/>
the female youth would lead them by a thousand snares. The<br/>
name of Wilford was mentioned often. As I read I smiled and<br/>
wept &amp; in my heart said O God protect my brothers my sister<br/>
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and my parents.</p>

<p>I left the School with my sister and together<br/>

house. I called upon Capt [[Francis Woodruff|Francis Woodruff]] [[Erastus Woodruff|Erastus Woodruff]] and [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna]]<br/>

[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff's]] family. He was absent. I also saw many other friends.<br/>
During the walk I passed the school house in which I spent many of<br/>
my youthful days. I gazed upon it and upon the graveyard where<br/>
slept many of my progenators and friends. There was reposing also<br/>
the remains of my mother. I read the inscription on their toombstones<br/>
of several numbered with the dead who were well when I left<br/>
[[Connecticut|Connecticut]] in 1832. On the toombstone of my mother was<br/>
the following inscription:</p>

<p>A pleasing form a generous gentle heart<br/>
A good companion just without art<br/>
Just in her dealings faithful to her friends<br/>
Beloved through life lamented in the end.</p>

<p>My mother [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Bulah Thompson Woodruff]] was born in 1782<br/>
and died June the 11th 1808 aged 26 years. She was married<br/>
to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] Nov 29 1801 and by him had three children—<br/>
namely, [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] born Nov 29th 1802; [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Ozem Thompson]] born Dec<br/>

<p>My father afterwards married [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Azubah Hart]] by whom<br/>
he had six children five sons and one daughter, my sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]].</p>

interesting address from President Brigham Young on</p>

<p>Dancing and Music</p>

<p>""I consider this a suitable place to give some instruction. We have<br/>
assembled here to have music and dancing. The world have had very strange<br/>
ideas concerning these things. They have supposed it was very wicked<br/>
for a Christian to dance or hear music. Many preachers of the day<br/>
have said that fidling and music came from hell; but I say there is<br/>
no fiddleing <strike>in</strike>or music in hell. There is not a fiddler in hell<br/>
nor any music of any kind. Music belongs to heaven to<br/>
cheer God angels and men. If we could hear the music there<br/>
is in heaven it would overwhelm mortal man</p>

<p>The Lord gave us that organ that makes<br/>
music so delightful to man and the Devil has stolen music and<br/>
many other things that was ordained of God for the benefit of man<br/>
and he has turned it to an evil use; but music and dancing<br/>
is for the benefit of the holy ones and if those who come here to<br/>
night are not holy and righteous and do not feel to worship and<br/>
praise God they have no business here</p>

<p>What strange ideas the world have of a Prophet<br/>
They would expect to see a man with finger nails a foot long<br/>
with his hair hanging to his hips his body covered with dirt and<br/>
filth his head bowed down ^in sorrow^ for the sins of the world and that</p>",

enquired concerning religious meetings in the place. It was the Sabbath<br/>

<p>When he had closed his meeting he invited us home with<br/>
him and gave us some refreshments and we presented him with the [[Book of Mormon|Book of<br/>
Mormon]]. He was mild and said he would read it</p>

<p>In the evening Mr Newton accompanied us to the meeting<br/>
house where the congregation assembled at the appointed time. With peculiar<br/>
feelings I arose and addressed them from ##Galatians 1:9|Galations 1st ch and 9<sup>th</sup> verse##<br/>
This was the first time that I or any Elder of the Church to my knowledge<br/>
ever arose before the inhabitants of one of the Islands of the sea to preach to<br/>
them the [[fulness of the gospel|fu^l^lness]] of the Everlasting Gospel and the Book of Mormon.</p>

I will give a synopsis of the Conference here.</p>

sent the whole of the quorum besides on mission and in that dreadful day of martyrdom <br/>
the Lord preserved [[Willard Richards|him]] scatheless and in the absence of the rest of the Twelve <br/>
the direction of the affairs of the Church in [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]] fell upon him <br/>
in that dreadful hour and in the midst of the mob at [[Carthage Jail, Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] with <br/>
the mangled bodies of the martyrs and the care of Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] his letters <br/>
and counsel<strike>l</strike>s held in check and tempered the grief and wrath of the community <br/>
of his brethren in Nauvoo</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1847 he was enrolled in the <br/>
memorable Band of Pioneers under President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and in the Spring <br/>
of 1848 he was unanimously elected by the voice of the Church as <br/>
Second Councillor in the Presidency of the Church.</p>

<p>He was secretary in the State Government of Deseret <br/>
and President of the Council of the Legislative Assembly after our <br/>
Territorial Organization, besides being Postmaster for [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake <br/>
City]] up till his death and a member of the Perpetual Emigrating <br/>
Fund Company.</p>

<p>He was also the Editor and Proprietor of the Deseret <br/>
News from its origin and General Historian of the whole Church and <br/>
Church Recorder</p>

<p>I have travelled with brother Willard Richards both <br/>
in [[England|England]] and America many miles and we have been warm <br/>
associates many times. He was a great Counsellor in the <br/>
Church and I as well as the body of the Saints have received much <br/>
excellent Counsel from him. He was the first man who had <br/>
a natural death in the Church from the First Presidency or the <br/>
Twelve Apostles. All who had died of them before had been <br/>
martyred.</p>

<p>On the day after the death of President Richards <br/>
in company with his brother [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] <br/>
I called upon President Brigham Young at his room for <br/>

<p>We met according to advise at 2 oclock at the <br/>
house of our departed brother and President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] took <br/>
charge of the ceremony. President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] was not <br/>
able to be present with us.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] made the prayer. He <br/>
prayed earnestly <strike>that</strike>for President Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball <br/>
and the person who should be chosen as Willard Richard's successor <br/>
also for the Twelve Apostles that they might prove true to their <br/>
integrity as brother Richards had done even unto the end. He <br/>
prayed for the wives and children of our lamented friend and brother <br/>
and that the Spirit of Willard might rest upon his oldest son <br/>
[[Heber John Richards|Heber John]] that he might stand at the head of his father's <br/>
house in dignity and honour. Elder [[George Darling Watt|Watt]] reported his prayer in <br/>
detail</p>

<p>At the close of the prayer the procession was formed. <br/>
Brother Kimball and Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] walked in front of the cor[p]se <br/>
and the Twelve Apostles walked by the side of it while his wives <br/>
children relatives and friends followed and a procession formed <br/>
behind them and as he was borne to his grave two bands played <br/>
a solemn death march.</p>

<p>After our brother was lowered into his grave <br/>
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] delivered a short appropriate address and while his <br/>
remarks were being made the times which I had spent with <br/>
brother Richards in a foreign country came to my mind and <br/>
I felt solemn and lonesome under the reflection</p>

<p>After the burial I called upon the <br/>
family and conversed with them and then attended prayer <br/>
meeting with the Twleve; and with Brother Kimball and <br/>
[[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin Richards]] returned to Willard Richards family <br/>
and spent the evening with them and brother Kimball conversed <br/>
with them till 9 o'clock and gave them much counsel. He </p>",

The follow is a key to his remarks brought out in social conversation</p>

<p>Views of President [[Brigham Young|Young]] on the Fall and Resurrection</p>

<p>He referred to the preaching of [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
the Sabbath before upon the subject of the resurrection. He said<br/>
the identicals particles of matter in which we had honored our spirits<br/>
<u>i.e.</u> our tabernacles in which we had suffered travelled labored and<br/>
built up the Kingdom of God they would be the identical bodies and<br/>
no other. They would be raised from the grave to immortality<br/>
and eternal lives</p>

<p>He said [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] and [[Eve (OT)|Eve]] had lived upon another<br/>
earth and were immortal when they came here. Adam assisted<br/>
in forming this earth and agreed to fall when he came here and he<br/>
fell that man might be; and the opposite principle to good—<br/>
the Devil the Serp<strike>a</strike>ent the Evil was placed upon the earth that<br/>
man might know the good from the evil for without an<br/>
experience in those things men could not know one from the<br/>
other.</p>

<p>As soon as the Devil was upon the earth he sowed<br/>
the seeds of death in everything; so that as soon as Adam<br/>
and Eve began to eat of the fruit of the earth they received<br/>
into their systems the seeds of mortality and of death. So<br/>
their children were mortal and subject to death sorrow and pain<br/>
who then when they partook of life joy ease and happiness<br/>
would know how to prise it. Father Adam would never<br/>
cease his labors to redeem his posterity and exalt them to all<br/>
the glory they were capable of receiving. He did not doubt<br/>
that Father Adam knew in the beginning how many<br/>
of his posterity would receive a celestial glory and who<br/>
they were and also of a terrestial and a telestial; yet man had</p>",

<p>Conference was called to order by President Brigham Young <br/>
and after the singing President Kimball offered up a prayer</p>

<p>President Young then arose and spoke upon the <br/>
death of  President [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and concerning filling his p[l]ace <br/>
in the Presidency. Upon this subject at the close of his discourse <br/>
the President said</p>

<p>""When the time comes to present before you the <br/>
quorums we shall probably supply the vacancy made by <br/>
the death of brother Willard Richards. Who will supply his </p>",
42829.0,61,,""">12th</time> we visited a splendid<br/>
coal mine. The vein was about 6 feet thick. It dipped to the<br/>
West about 20 degrees. The coal was of excellent quality and<br/>
we brought some of it along with us. This coal bed was in<br/>
sight on both sides of the Kanyon and was about 10 miles<br/>
N.N.W. from [[Fort Ephraim, Sanpete County, Utah Territory|Fort Ephraim]].</p>

<p>We reached Fort Ephraim that night and held <br/>
a meeting. Presidents [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah M. Grant]]<br/>
preached to the people</p>

<p>Description of Fort Ephraim<br/>
in 1855</p>

<p>Fort Ephraim was laid out with an inner fort 12 1/2 by 15<br/>
rods wide built with a stone wall 2 feet thick 10 feet high</p>",
42829.0,21,,"<p>place in the First Presidency? is a question that has not yet been answered though <br/>
many have talked to [[Brigham Young|me]] about it. I have asked the Twelve to dictate this <br/>
part of the business but they have thrown it back. Well I will say where <br/>
it ought to be. They said it was not their place to dictate the affair <br/>
but to confirm the conclusions of the President. If the Conference will <br/>
show the best method of knowing who is the best man to be my <br/>
Second Counsillor I will readily listen to their wisdom. The Twelve <br/>
would have nothing to do with it but said it was the privilege of <br/>
the President to choose his own Counsellor and for them to run the <br/>
risk of its being right or wrong. However if the Conference wish <br/>
to dictate this matter I will give them an opportunity. That is <br/>
my method of doing business; as long as we are of one heart <br/>
and of one mind there is no ground for discord or dissension.""</p>

<p>The President also spoke upon the subject of <br/>
appointing new gathering places designing to establish three or four <br/>
new locations for this purpose East and West especially ^for^ the emigration <br/>
from [[Europe|Europe]]</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] addressed the meeting <br/>
and was followed by [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and President Young upon <br/>
the subject of the Indian war</p>

<p>I met in council with President Young and council <br/>
and the quorum of the Twelve and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] was appointed <br/>
to go to Horner's Ranch in [[California|California]] to establish a Stake. <br/>
[[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] was appointed to go to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis]] to take charge of <br/>
the Saints in that region and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] to take charge of the <br/>
Stake in [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnatti]]</p>

<p>The subject of consecration came up the next <br/>
day. Touching the matter President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] said that <br/>
what President Young had presented to the people to carry out <br/>
was only what we had in our houses for years. All have to be <br/>
purchased. I want all I have to be secured in the Kingdom <br/>
of God. If the Presidency and Twelve enter into this order they </p>",

splendid white limestone 4 feet thick at the bottom 2 feet at the top<br/>
18 feet high 60 rods in length and 44 rods wid<strike>e</strike>th from side to side<br/>
of the fort.</p>

<p>The [[Fort Ephraim, Sanpete County, Utah Territory|city]] contained 400 inhabitants two thirds of whom<br/>
were Danish. They ha<strike>ve</strike>d a school taught by a man in the<br/>
Winter and a woman in the Summer. This city had been<br/>
established about one year yet the inside wall was built</p>

<p>The intention of the inhabitants was to build</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday. Meeting commenced at 10 o'clock<br/>
The Danish brethren sang. President [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M Grant]] preached and<br/>
was followed by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] and President [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]]. Wilford Woodruff reported.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting the company rode to<br/>
[[Manti, Sanpete County, Utah Territory|Manti]] and held a meeting. Brother Cherry lost his horses and as I<br/>
rode with him I did not get to Manti until near dark so that I<br/>
could not attend meeting</p>

<p>On my arrival President Young requested me<br/>
to get the brethren together who were appointed to go to the Elk<br/>
Mountain and set them apart for their mission</p>

<p>Accordingly we met the missionaries a<strike>nd</strike>t the house<br/>
of brother [[Titus Billings|Billings]] and President Grant and myself set apart 12 persons<br/>
to the Elk Mountain and 2 to [[Las Vegas, Carson County, Utah Territory|Las Vegas]]. We ordained<br/>
6 to the quorums of Seventies. The whole number appointed<br/>
and set apart to the Elk Mountain was 40. President Grant<br/>
addressed them in the Spirit and power of God and was followed by<br/>
[[Truman Osborn Angell|Truman O Angel]] and Wilford Woodruff. I reported the address<br/>
of President J. M. Grant.</p>

your graves and it will still be the work of God and will continue <br/>
to be to all eternity.""</p>

Bishop [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoots]] at the Sugar Works and stoped until brother Angel <br/>

<p>We held a meeting in the evening: President Young <br/>
addressed the people. I was not in at the commencement and had <br/>
no chance of reporting his discourse. The following is a key to his <br/>

<p>""I do not wish to spend my time neither is it profitable for <br/>
any man to spend his time in telling the people what was done in <br/>
the days of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] [[Enoch (OT)|Enoch]] and [[Noah (OT)|Noah]] thousands of years ago but my <br/>
business is to tell the people what they should do to day in order to <br/>
be saved. This is my doctrine all the time. What can I do <br/>
or this people do to-day in any one thing in order to build up the <br/>
kingdom of God or to advance any step farther towards the salvation</p>",

<p>Now what has been the coun<strike>ci</strike>sel to this people for several years <br/>
past? It has been to ^build^ f^or^t^s^ <strike>up</strike>; to wall in your cities with strong walls <br/>
This has been the voice of the Lord unto them all the day long. Have the <br/>
people listened to this voice? Have they carried out this counsel? No <br/>
they have not? But what have they done? They have been ready to say <br/>
what nead hath the Lord of this thing? Do you <strike>real</strike>think there is any danger <br/>
of the Indians? Do you think that brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] really believes that <br/>
it is necessary to go to so much expence in building walls around our cities?<br/>
Instead of going to work and doing what they are told to do the people <br/>
spend their time in talking about it and trying to evade it.</p>

<p>Now I wish to ask a question. The Lord has appointed <br/>
me to lead this people. The people have chosen me as their leader <br/>
and covenanted to sustain me and obey my counsel. Now if I tell <br/>
the people what to do and they do not do it nor carry out my counsel <br/>
but turn from it and go to work and do something else and they continue <br/>
this year after year while at the same time I am warning them of <br/>
the danger of their course and telling them of the judgements which will <br/>
come upon them if they do not alter their course and go to work and <br/>
do as I have told them do you suppose they will escape the chastening <br/>
rod of the Almighty? No they will not.</p>

<p>If the people continue to pursue their present<br/>
course and the chastening rod does not fall upon their heads I should <br/>
become disregarded in the sight of God angels and men. This people <br/>
may rest assured that they are preparing a rod for their ^own^ backs if they <br/>
do not listen to my counsel and do what I tell them</p>

<p>But says one I would go to work and help build <br/>
a wall around the city if I knew it was a revelation from God and <br/>
that it was His will we should do it. I want to say to such that <br/>
it is my will that you should do it and that it is enough. I am <br/>
responsible for it and if you want to know any farther about <br/>
it do right. Pray unto the Lord and have faith before him that <br/>
you may have visions and revelations from God so that you </p>",

you will not question the reasonableness of these things but go to <br/>
work and do them with all your might</p>

<p>My teaching is to tell the people what to do <br/>
to be saved to-day for if you get out of the path of salvation to day <br/>
you are in danger of being out of it to-morrow and the farther you <br/>
stray from it the more difficulty you will meet in ever finding <br/>
it again</p>

<p>It would be folly in my spending my time in telling the <br/>
people about the glories of the Millennium while I see them straying <br/>
from those paths that would lead to those glories</p>

<p>Now many of this people will say I have fine <br/>
farms horses cattle goods gold and riches. The possessor says I <br/>
look upon them; I say these are mine. At the same time <br/>
you do not once think that there is not one thing in your possession <br/>
that is yours. It all belongs to God; and even you yourselves <br/>
belong to God. All you have belong[s] to Him and He has <br/>
only loaned it to you and yet you do not acknowledge his hand <br/>
in anything while you should acknowledge his hand in all things</p>

<p>I know what the design of the Lord is in <br/>
leading the people to this place and his design concerning [[Israel|Israel]] <br/>
and it is none of your business what I counsel you to do. It is <br/>
your business to go to work and do it. Leave the event <br/>
with God.</p>

<p>I want this people to build their forts as I tell them <br/>
and when you have built this fort and made a wall six feet thick <br/>
and twelve feet high and get comfortable in your houses then go <br/>
to work and build one on the outside 12 feet thick and run them <br/>
both up together 25 feet high and keep building until I tell you <br/>
to stop and be in a situation that you may shut up your gates <br/>

walked to [[Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Chelsea]] and thence to [[Charlestown, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Charleston]]</p>

<p>Here we visited the [[Bunker Hill Monument, Charlestown, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Bunker Hill monument]] and<br/>
walked upon the entrenchments that was flung up by our<br/>
brave fathers during the night preceding that memorable battle<br/>
upon [[Bunker Hill, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Bunker Hill]]. But the roar of cannon and the clash<br/>
of arms had long ceased but the sound from the populous<br/>

our fathers were sleeping in peace.</p>

of the Navy yard and thence we entered the City of Boston<br/>

eyes beheld its wealth.</p>

<p>I spent several hours in visiting the city<br/>
which at that time contained a population of one hundred<br/>
thousand. The market-place of Boston was probably<br/>
as neat beautiful and well furnished as any one in<br/>
America. The starchhouse which we visited was also<br/>
a fine place. We went to the Cupalo and had a<br/>
fair view of the whole city. I walked around the<br/>
commons which was inclosed with an iron railing of<br/>
about 2 1/2 miles in length. We visited the Tremont House<br/>

<p><u>Address By President Young</u></p>

<p>President Young arose and said:</p>

<p>""I am not in the habit of taking a <br/>
text but I will now take for my text the last lines that were sung: ""God <br/>
is his own interpreter and he will make it plain.""</p>

<p>But do the people understand those things which are <br/>
for our good? The Lord will not explain all things unto us. He <br/>
understands; but he will make his people walk by faith. He will <br/>
not explain all his mysteries to the people. We read in the ##JST, Hebrews 11:1|New <br/>
Testament## that faith is the assurance of things hoped for—the evidence <br/>
of things not seen.</p>

<p>Have we all got faith? It is our duty to have faith <br/>
in God and his word and promise. You have to trust in God. <br/>
He will not reveal all things unto us</p>

<p>Some men are tried with the counsel given and <br/>
will not obey. They will not have glory in the Kingdom of God <br/>
They are bastards and not sons. The Lord intends for the people <br/>
to be tried so as to prove the faithful. What God does reveal he <br/>
reveals for the purpose of leading men in the way of salvation</p>

<p>The people do not know the way of the Lord <br/>
They come here and say I am going to build myself up. I have to <br/>
work so hard I cannot get time to pray. But are you doing right <br/>
when you do this? We may labour to get all things about us yet <br/>
the Lord will control it as seemeth him good</p>

<p>If you get into the dark still hold on to <br/>
the work of God. No matter if I don't feel like praying I </p>",
42828.0,132,,"<p>When I arrived at the prison the jailor permitted<br/>
me to enter the room where brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] was confined<br/>
At this time we were strangers after the flesh but related<br/>
in the Gospel. This was the first time I had ever<br/>
visited an^y^ <strike>Elder</strike> ^one^ in prison.</p>

<p>After the keeper had turned the key upon<br/>
us and left us together I began to enquire into the<br/>
state of his mind and found him strong in the<br/>
faith. He had the Bible Book of Mormon [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley's]]<br/>
[[A Voice of Warning|Voice of Warning]] and the [[The Evening and The Morning Star|Evening and Morning Star]]<br/>
as his companions which he constantly read</p>

<p>We conversed together about three hours and he<br/>
informed me of many things that had transpired while<br/>
there. Among the variety he mentioned the goal taking<br/>
fire a few days before my visit. He said this looked<br/>
like a dark hour. The fire was roaring over his head<br/>
while a scene of uproar confusion and distress was<br/>
upon every hand; the engines were rapidly playing around<br/>
the building water poured into every room the people<br/>
hallooing in the streets the prisoners crying for mercy<br/>
to be let out lest they should be consumed one of the<br/>
number was struggling in the agonies of death while<br/>
others were cursing swearing &amp;c. He said he felt composed<br/>
through the confused scene until the fire was extinguished</p>

<p>Bro Rockwood was writing his life while<br/>
in confinement; and he sent a roll of the same by<br/>
me to his [[Nancy Haven Rockwood|wife]] in [[Holliston, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Holliston]].</p>

<p>At half past 8 o'clock p.m. the jailor came<br/>
and unlocked the prison doors and I left brother R. in<br/>
spirits and bent my way back to the city of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]]<br/>
When crossing the long bridge on my return I heard the<br/>
cry of fire the ringing<s>s</s> of bells and the ratling of engines<br/>
The flames soon illuminated the city but in half an hour<br/>
it was extinguished</p>

<p>Being alone and a strange in the darkness<br/>
of the night I lost my way in the midst of the city but<br/>
after wandering awhile I found No 9 Myrtle Street where<br/>
Elder [[Joseph T. Ball|Ball]] and a company of Saints were patiently waiting<br/>
for me. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour I spent</p>",
42829.0,68,,""">25</time>. It was 104<br/>
rods square. The wall 6 feet thick at the bottom 2 1/2 at the top and<br/>
it had reached 6 feet in height. This fort contained 80 families and<br/>
three hundred and fifty persons.</p>

<p><u>[[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo City]] in 1855</u></p>

<p>At this date the city of Provo<br/>
was one mile square with a wall the same which was 6 feet thick<br/>
at the bottom 2 at the top and 12 feet high. One half of the wall was<br/>
finished. Its population was 2500, five hundred families and<br/>
houses some of which were good and many improvements were visible<br/>
There was one Seminary containing 4 school rooms four schools<br/>
were kept containing 100 scholars. There were 2 grist mills<br/>
2 saw mills 1 carding machine clothdressing &amp;c and a <strike>thi</strike><br/>
Tithing office.</p>

<p><u>[[Springville, Utah County, Utah Territory|Springville]] in 1855</u></p>

<p>Springville Fort was 3/4 of a mile square with a wall<br/>
12 feet high 6 feet thick at the bottom 2 1/2 at the top. Forty rods<br/>
of it was completed and 2 sides 6 feet high. Springville<br/>
contained one thousand inhabitants 200 able bodied men 3 schools<br/>
one male and 2 female schools</p>

<p><u>[[Payson, Utah County, Utah Territory|Pason]] in 1855</u></p>

<p>Pason was 96 rods square with a wall the same. The wall<br/>
was to be 12 feet high 6 feet thick at the bottom and 2 feet at<br/>
the top, six feet heaght of which was already built. This<br/>
Fort contained 90 families 450 inhabitants 110 able-bodied men<br/>

<p>If the Lord should open the vision ^of the minds^ of the people who have <br/>
gone to [[California|California]] so that they could see things as they are they would <br/>
as soon cut their throats as to have done it. But they dont see it: they <br/>
have to go and suffer until they are satisfied</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] will say the same to this people. If we do <br/>
not the things which God requires we shall be whiped until we are <br/>
sore. This is the only thing that will save us. I now tell you <br/>
that those who are gone and are going to California without counsel <br/>
will have it till they are sore</p>

<p>I know the truth but I cannot tell it all <br/>
to you until God permits me to do it. Now if you have not <br/>
confidence in me to follow me and believe that I am doing right drop <br/>
me and appoint another and I will follow in the wake</p>

<p>In the beginning of this work God tried to <br/>
get this people to be one but they would not be one. I will tell <br/>
you what to do. God intends to make you one. You must be <br/>
one and there must be a beginning to this. And you must begin <br/>
in small things like children making cob houses.</p>

<p>The people went to [[Missouri|Missouri]] and there <br/>
they quarrelled about many small matters. Then God said I <br/>
will throw down their good houses; and God drove ^all the people^ out and then <br/>
they were knocked into pi. Did they do any better then? No <br/>
they did not. God tries his people both with riches and with poverty <br/>
If I <strike>will</strike> ^am^ <strike>be</strike> faithful in my poverty I <strike>will</strike> ^shall^ own all riches that is <br/>
neadful.</p>

<p>Now God wants us to be of one heart and one mind <br/>
He may have no other motive than to make us work together. He <br/>
will tell us to build fences and forts that our feelings and interests <br/>
may be united in something. Now will you do it? We are <br/>
required to become of one heart and mind and work together in these <br/>
little things that we do understand or else we could not be prepared <br/>
to work together and be one in those eternal things which we do not </p>",

<p>It is nothing but the power of God that has preserved this <br/>
[[Battle Creek, Utah County, Utah Territory|settlement]]. The Indians could have killed every man woman and child here and <br/>
not a man had a gun ready to defend himself</p>

<p>When you have become of one heart and mind God has treasures <br/>
for you and he has given us capacity to see if we will magnify our calling <br/>
with everything we have to do in our lives. We are approaching very swiftly <br/>
the time when Jesus will come to see if we are of one heart and mind which the <br/>
Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said would be in this generation and will manifest himself to the <br/>
Saints and take up his abode with them. This was said twenty one years <br/>
ago and in 26 years more if we are not prepared to meet Jesus and angels we <br/>
shall be wiped out and sent to hell. We are fast approaching the time.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] do not care what was done in the morning of creation <br/>
or the days of [[Noah (OT)|Noah]]. I want to know what this people will do. Will <br/>
you be Saints and live your religion and magnify your calling in the <br/>
Church[?]</p>

<p>I will now tell this people what they should do. I will <br/>
tell the [[Henson Walker Jr.|Bishop]] in the presence of the people what to do. Bishop I tell <br/>
you, go and start this wall and build it 6 feet thick and 12 or 14 feet <br/>
high; Shut up every gate except two and then you can lie down <br/>
in safety and an enemy cannot come upon you. If this is not the <br/>
will of the Lord, I do know it is my will and you should not <br/>
question any farther. God wants it done and I want it done and dont <br/>
stop until you are secured and that is enough.</p>

<p>Your stacks have been so placed that one Indian <br/>
could fire all this place and others shoot you down while you are fighting <br/>

<p>What if the people in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson Co]]. had been good and been <br/>
sacrificing? What would have been the situation of the people. Why <br/>
the liars and goats would have had their heads cut off but the wheat and <br/>
tares had to be transplanted together in the wilderness. It was not <br/>
the acts of Joseph that cassed the removal of this people. It is the <br/>

Interpreter waited until they came up and they enquired if we were<br/>

Governor had presents for them for giving up the murderers of<br/>

<p>Remarks By President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]].</p>

<p>It is not my place to get up to reveal anything for it is the head <br/>
to convey it to the body; but it is for me to carry out his designs <br/>
and do his will; for when I do the will of President Young I do the <br/>
will of God and no man can get salvation unless he keeps his counsel <br/>
It is his will that the city should be walled and fortified and that is <br/>
my will. When I do just as he tells me I do the will of my <br/>
father in heaven for he is the only man who holds the keys of salvation.<br/>
When I feel reluctant to do his will I feel bad and so do you all <br/>
When I do his will I can sleep in peace and my heart is consoled <br/>
all the day long. This is also the case with you when you <br/>
do as the [[Henson Walker Jr.|Bishop]] tells you. Last year your improvements <br/>
were all scattered about but now you are got into a smashed <br/>
suckertash pie. Now go to and save yourselves against all selfishness <br/>
I am going to put my property and all my wives into the Church—<br/>
and then nothing can be taken out of the Church. I am going <br/>
to dedicate all I have to God</p>

prominant place that followed in ^quick^ succession at about this<br/>
date of my history.</p>

<p>Baptism of my Relatives. Organization of a Branch<br/>
of the Church in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] consisting of my Father<br/>
Step-mother, Sister, Uncle, Aunts, Cousins and one [[Dwight Webster|other]].</p>

My call to the Quorum of the Twelve. My journey to<br/>
[[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]]. Death of my Brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]]. Dangerous<br/>
illness of my wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]].</p>

<p>My father [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]] had at times<br/>
for many years been seeking religion and the favour<br/>
of God; and for more than 20 years a numerous circle<br/>
of friends had made his case a subject of prayer and<br/>
pled with the Lord in his behalf. But as often as<br/>
my father had struggled for victory Satan had hindered<br/>
him and gained the <strike>victory</strike> ^mastery^.</p>",

only lent to me by the Lord and I forfeit everything when I go astray. If <br/>
righteousness was laid to the line it would take many heads from their shoulders <br/>
and the day will be when that will be done.</p>

<p>Now do as the Bishop tells you and not go to [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt <br/>
Lake]] to President [[Brigham Young|Young]] to alter this or that. Pray that this people <br/>
may do right for when you dishonor the Priesthood you dishonor God. I <br/>
have been told that some have said I will honor the Priesthood but I will not <br/>
honor hi<strike>s</strike>m that holds the Priesthood; but I say you cannot honor one <br/>
without honoring the other</p>

<p>Bishop [[Henson Walker Jr.|Walker]] is presiding here. Follow his counsel and <br/>
all will be right and the blessing of God will rest upon you. Even so. Amen</p>

<p>Benedition by Wilford Woodruff. We rode to [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]] and spent <br/>
the night. Next day which was Sunday the people assembled in the meeting <br/>
house in two rooms. Wilford Woodruff addressed the people in one room <br/>
and was followed by President Young whose sermon I reported. H. C. <br/>
Kimball spoke to the people in the other room and [[Thomas Bullock|T. Bullock]] reported <br/>
In the afternoon [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] spoke and was followed by H C Kimball <br/>
and I reported and in the next room President Young addressed the <br/>
people and Thomas Bullock reported.</p>

<p>On Monday we rode to [[Springville, Utah County, Utah Territory|Springville]] and held <br/>
meetings with the people. President Young preached and myself and <br/>
T. Bullock reported and in the evening [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and <br/>
Wilford Woodruff addressed the people.</p>

<p>Next day we rode a few miles and nooned. President <br/>
Young with some others went to appoint a location for a fort and we <br/>
then continued to [[Payson, Utah County, Utah Territory|Pason]] where President Young preached; <strike>and here</strike> <br/>
He got some oxen also in the settlements to take to [[Chief Walker|Walker]]—the Indian <br/>
chief and he counselled the people in all the settlements to feed the <br/>
Indians and treat them kindly</p>

<p>On the following day we rode 15 miles and nooned <br/>
and here we organized. [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|D. H. Wells]] was commander-in-chief <br/>

and stoped and spent the night near Walker and his band. I</p>

<p>President Young and his Council tried to have <br/>
a talk with Walker. At first he appeared dogish and was not<br/>
disposed to talk. When we first formed our corrall within 40 <br/>
rods of his camp he gathered all his warriors and made quite a display <br/>
but we did not go out to meet them at the time and they turned their <br/>
horses out and went into their tents.</p>

<p>When we called upon Walker he laid down <br/>
in the dirt and did not feel disposed to talk; but Brother <br/>
Young manifested great patience with him even after the patience <br/>
of most men would have been exhausted. He went to him and <br/>
lifted him out of the dirt and finally got him to talk some. The <br/>
following is a Synopsis of the conversation with Walker</p>

<p>He said he had no spirit. He had no heart. Did <br/>
not feel as though he could talk. ""And when I heard that President <br/>
Young was coming I felt that I had no heart. I do not want to <br/>
talk. I want to hear President Young talk and then sit still <br/>
and hear others talk.</p>

<p>President Young gave him some tobac<strike>o</strike>co. he <br/>
said when he had plenty of tobacco than all his friends would <br/>
come in and smoke with him but when he was out of tobacco <br/>
they would not come to see him</p>

<p>Governor Young said I have brought some beef <br/>
cattle for you. I want one killed so that you can have </p>",
42828.0,137,,"<p>into the New Covenant with me. Without shame I have declared<br/>
the Gospel to them. They felt that God had sent me and that<br/>
they must obey.</p>

<p>The day had come. From my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house I<br/>
and my friends started to the appointed place, bending our way towards the<br/>
river to attend to the sacred ordinance of baptism. The spot<br/>
was reached! We stood upon the [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|river's]] bank! Nature spread her<br/>
fields of pleasing green and the Sun shed forth his golden<br/>
rays to gladden the earth while the silver stream was rolling<br/>
at my feet and seemed to say I am ready for the Master's<br/>
service.</p>

<p>With feelings better imagined than described<br/>
I dwelt upon the scene and cast my eyes upon the audience<br/>
while we sung praises to the God of Israel</p>

<p>Who would not have bowed the knee<br/>
while offering the sacrifice of the heart and imploring the<br/>
blessing of Heaven that the Spirit might pervade the waters<br/>
and rest upon the candidates?</p>

<p>As from our knees we arose I entered<br/>
the watery element and asked who was ashamed of the bed<br/>
where Jesus lay. Many eyes were turned to behold the<br/>
scene as my father followed me into the water and deep<br/>
solemnity rested upon their countenances.</p>

<p>I took my father by the hand while he<br/>
covenanted to walk with God; and for the [[remission of sins|remission of his sins]]<br/>
I baptized him. Feeling the victory won, my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]] followed<br/>
his footsteps.</p>

<p>[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] my sister my only sister was ready. The<br/>
garb of pride had been rent and now fearless of the world's despising<br/>
she next entered the waters of baptism and thus followed her<br/>
Divine Master.</p>

<p>For the consolation of Israel Aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna]] had<br/>
long looked and now she rejoiced that she could the ancient path<br/>
persue while upon her example and upon the holy scene her<br/>
young daughters gazed and seemed to say O Lord prepare us likewise<br/>
to do thy will.</p>

<p>[[Seth Woodruff|Seth]] in his early youth was not too young to<br/>
serve his God and he desired to follow the example of his<br/>
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|father]] [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|mother]] and [[John Woodruff|brother]] whom I baptized a year before.</p>",
42829.0,73,,""">18th</time> the committee met at 7 oclock in the<br/>
evening at the Library Room to draft the constitution and by laws<br/>

42829.0,33,,"<p>a feast while we are here</p>

<p>[[Chief Walker|Walker]] wanted to have the Mormons sing before the parties <br/>
took a smoke. He said [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] came and his heart was good <br/>
but [[Dimick Baker Huntington|D. Huntington]] came and his heart was running</p>

<p>We then sung and when we <strike>had</strike> this was done Walker <br/>
again spoke and said I have not got the Spirit of the Lord and if <br/>
there is any one here that can give me the Spirit of the Lord I wish <br/>
they would do it. He said white people in heaven were happy.</p>

<p><u>[[Tulpidge|Tulpidge]]</u> next spoke amid much crying and tears <br/>
He was the Indian who had his wife-squaw killed. He said D. Huntington <br/>
had been good to him and he had not seen him since his child died. He <br/>
said they had not got good hearts and the Mormons' hearts were now <br/>
good who were here. We have now good peace and can all lie down <br/>
in peace without fear and I want to live in friendship with this people</p>

<p>We left the Indian Camp and returned to our waggons <br/>
But President Young had another talk with Walker this day. I was <br/>
not present and [[Thomas Bullock|Thomas Bullock]] reported</p>

<p>On the following day we again visited Walker at <br/>
his tent. He was still in the same unpleasant mood and <br/>
did not wish to talk and he left his tent and went into the <br/>
willows, and others talked. The Indians had a sick child and <br/>
they wished the Elders to lay hands up it. Then President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] Benson<br/>
and [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] laid hands upon it and administered to it. Dr [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Sprague]]<br/>
also left some medicine for it and for others who were sick</p>

<p>The Indian said if the child died he should <br/>
have to kill an Indian child or a Mormon child to go with it. (This <br/>
is their tradition). The interpreter told him he must not do it—that <br/>
it was wrong; that when Mormon children died we did not <br/>
kill any child to go with them and they must not do it for <br/>
it was not right. The Indian said his heart was not <br/>
so. He wanted to kill some one to go with him. He said <br/>
he wanted his child to get well and then he would go with us</p>",

scene of this day was full of interest.""</p>

<p>We returned from the river's bank to my<br/>
father's house where I confirmed those whom I had<br/>
baptized and organized them into a branch named<br/>
the [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Branch of the Church of Latter Day Saints.<br/>
The bread and wine being blessed we partook of it in<br/>
remembrance of him who had died for us. I also<br/>
ordained Dwight Webster to the office of Priest.</p>

<p>Those who composed the Farmington Branch<br/>
at its organization were as follows</p>

42829.0,34,,"<p>but he did not want to go till his child was well. He said [[Chief Walker|Walker]] <br/>
was a great chief and President [[Brigham Young|Young]] was a great chief and that w<strike>a</strike>hat <br/>
he said was true and that he could not say anything wrong</p>

<p><u>[[Petetnet|Petetnet]]</u> spoke and said they would be good and <br/>
not kill anybody <strike>m</strike>and not steal and that one could go alone and not <br/>
be killed and that there would be not blood in their path</p>

<p><u>Walker</u> wished President Young to write a letter so <br/>
that he could show it to the people and let them know that we <br/>
were at peace so that there would be no difficulties with the people <br/>
President Young wrote one and Dr [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Sprague]] gave medicine to the <br/>
sick child and gave Walker directions how to deal with it and with <br/>
the others who were sick.</p>

<p>On parting with Walker and his tent he said <br/>
we now understood each other. That they were now to have all peace <br/>
so all could go on the road in peace and not be afraid; they <br/>
could not put in wheat and corn and one alone without somebody <br/>
killing them. He now wanted to have the road clear without <br/>
any blood in it. He wished for peace all the time. <br/>
President Young and Walker shook hands and then all the <br/>
company shook hands and the pipe of peace was smoked</p>

<p>Walker received his presents and killed a beef <br/>
for the Indians to have a feast. They also traded,—swaped <br/>
blankets for horses and bought two children who were prisoners</p>

<p>After we had made peace and got through <br/>
trading We left Walker's camp and rode to the [[Sevier River, Utah Territory|Severe]] <br/>
Walker [[Grosephene|Grus<strike>p</strike>ephene]] [[Washear|Squash-head]] with many others went with us <br/>
and we spent the night at the Severe. We made a raft <br/>
and crossed all our waggons over in one hour and 30 minutes <br/>
I spent all my leasure moments daily with [[Thomas Bullock|Thomas Bullock]] <br/>
in keeping a history of the journey</p>

<p>Next day we reached [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|Filmore City]] <br/>
a distance of 35 miles from the Severe and we had hail and <br/>
rain storms all day.</p>",

by the way side. This was my last walk with my [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] at<br/>
this ^time^ for on the morrow I left [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] for my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife's]] [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]]</p>

<p>After evening prayers [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] retired to rest and I<br/>
spent a season in conversation with [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]]. We felt sensibly the<br/>
weight of the powers of temptation that try the souls of men<br/>
but out of which the Lord delivers his Saints. I also spent<br/>
a short time with sister Eunice before retiring and we mingled<br/>
our sympathies tears and prayers together before a throne<br/>
of grace.</p>

<p>I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep and<br/>
after once more partaking of the bounties of earth around the<br/>
family and bowing before the Lord and offering up our<br/>
morning  sacrifice I took the parting hand of my father<br/>
mother and sister Eunice and once more bid adieu to my<br/>
native place.</p>

<p>I arrived in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on the 5th and took<br/>
the steam boat Portland at 7 p. m. and started for the city<br/>
of [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]. In the morning we saw a Spanish flag of<br/>
distress at sea. We approached her and found her to be the<br/>
wreck of a Spanish brig. They had been wrecked about 10 days<br/>
but all the crew was on board and no lives lost. We<br/>
towed her into Portland.</p>

<p>We arrived at 8 a. m. and after taking<br/>
breakfast with my brother-in-law [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra Carter]] I visited<br/>
some book stores and purchased an Album for Mrs<br/>
Woodruff.</p>

<p>I then walked to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] and had<br/>
the pleasure of again greeting my wife and friends in<br/>
peace and prosperity.</p>

by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]; and in the afternoon Elder [[Nathaniel V. Jones|Nathaniel V Jones]] from<br/>
the Presidency of the Hindostan and Burman empire mission related<br/>
his travels in those lands. He said that the Elders of the Church had<br/>
travelled from the [[Himalayas, Asia|Himalaya Mountains]] to near the Southern limits of the <br/>
Peninsula and that a Mr Wilson Episcopalian Bishop of [[Calcutta, British India|Calcutta]] wrote<br/>
to the clergy in all the military cantonments to forbid the Elders preaching<br/>

viewed the country around. I also went on to the ceder heights <br/>
with T. Bullock and [[Phineas Howe Young|Phineas Young]] and viewed the country. We <br/>
had prayers together</p>

<p>Phineas Young said that he was ^the first^ chosen in the <br/>
organization of the first quorum of the Twelve Apostles but brother <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said he wished I would let [[William Smith|W<u>m</u> Smith]] have that place so I <br/>
gave way to him. This is not true</p>

<p>Elder Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>A few days since President <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith Jun]] and some others were assembled<br/>
to attend to some Church business when it was thought<br/>
proper to select those who were designed of the Lord to<br/>
fill the places of those of the Twelve who had fallen<br/>
away namely [[William Earl McLellin|Wm. E. Mc Lellin]] [[Lyman Eugene Johnson|Lyman E. Johnson]]<br/>
[[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] and [[John Farnham Boynton|John F Bointon]]. The persons<br/>
selected were [[John Edward Page|John E Page]], [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] Wilford Woodruff<br/>
and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]].</p>

<p>On the following day five of the Twelve with<br/>
President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] and some others met and resolved that<br/>
President Rigdon wrte to Brother Richards who is now in<br/>
[[England|England]] and inform him of his appointment and that<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] write to [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and inform him that<br/>
the Lord has commanded that the Twelve assemble <strike>in<br/>

I should write to yourself.</p>",

our arrival I went to the Iron Works and examined all the premises <br/>
and saw several pigs of native iron. [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] explained to <br/>
me the difficulties they had to encounter in making iron which I <br/>

and Whitney I rode 6 miles to Summit Creek. The previous <br/>
Summer there were 12 houses here which were removed during <br/>
the Indian war but the fort was standing. From thence <br/>
we rode 6 miles farther to the Summit of the [[Great Basin|Great Basin]] and <br/>
then 7 miles farther to Battle Creek.</p>

<p>Here we had splendid mountain senery <br/>
of red rocks standing like pyramids 1000 feet high. Opposite <br/>
this cite was <strike>a</strike> [[Fort Harmony, Washington County, Utah Territory|<strike>f</strike>Fort Harmony]] to be located 6 miles from the <br/>
base of the mountain on the East, the fort on the West. We <br/>
then rode to the present location of Fort Harmony which by the <br/>
rodeometer was 287 miles from [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]]</p>

<p>This was a good grazing country and <br/>
splendid mountain Scenery. The brethren were trying <br/>
to take out the stream of water called Ash Creek to water <br/>
their farming land. They had carried it 6 miles and <br/>
had to carry it <strike>6</strike>2 miles farther to carry it on to their new <br/>
field which they were making. The missionaries who <br/>
were sent out the last Winter from Salt Lake had done<br/>
this. [[Rufus Chester Allen|Rufus Allen]] was their captain. [[John Doyle Lee|John D. Lee]] <br/>
had the charge of their old fort.</p>

<p>Fort Harmony was 15 miles from <br/>
the [[Virgin River, United States|Rio Virgin]]</p>

<p>I went fishing but caught nothing though <br/>
it was said there were some small trout in the Creek</p>",

<p>After retiring to bed I prayed to the Lord<br/>
to show me what we should teach the people and I received<br/>
for an answer, ""Let my servants obtain the Holy Ghost and keep<br/>
my Spirit with them and that will instruct them what to teach<br/>
the people continually. Instruct the people to keep my Spirit<br/>

<p>Quarterly Conference</p>

<p>At Farmington<br/>
October the 20th 1855.</p>

<p>Saturday morning at 10 o'clock the people in the 1st District</p>",
42828.0,141,,"<p>Know then Brother Woodruff by this that you are appointed<br/>
to fill the place of one of the Twelve Apostles and that it is<br/>
agreeable to the word of the Lord given very lately that you should<br/>
come spedily to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] and on the 26th of April next to take<br/>
your leave of the Saints here and depart for other climes across<br/>
the mighty deep!</p>

<p>Yours in the love of God<br/>
[[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B. Marsh]].</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the threats of the people to mob tar<br/>
feather and kill me if I came there again I was determined<br/>
to visit once more the Saints upon the Islands of the Sea<br/>
The next few days was occuppied in carrying out this design<br/>
I also had a short interview with Mr [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]] the Methodist<br/>
Priest and his countenance indicated the wrath of his heart</p>

<p>On the 13th of August I gave my last farewel<br/>
to the Islands and started for my [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father-in-law's]] where<br/>
I arrived on the 20th.</p>

<p>The last day of summer I rode in company<br/>
with Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and sister [[Rhoda Farnham Carter Scammans|Rhoda F Scamman]] to the<br/>
beach on the sea shore. We spent an hour riding upon<br/>
this beautiful beach extending along the shore for about seven<br/>
miles in length and one hundred rods in wedth at low<br/>
water. It is composed of fine white sand, is almost a dead<br/>
level and very easy and pleasent to ride or walk upon.</p>

<p>The sun shone brilliantly upon the face of<br/>
nature the canvas of the gallant ships were filled with the<br/>
morning breeze as they sailed upon the great deep; wave<br/>
after wave reached the extent of their bounds upon the shore<br/>
and then rolled back to their source again. These together<br/>
with other varieties made the morning's excursion very pleasent.</p>

<p>After picking up a quantity of sea shells to carry<br/>
to the land of Zion for domestic uses and in memory of<br/>
the place we returned to Mr [[Luther Scammans|Scamman's]] and after visiting<br/>
others of the brethren we reached Father Carter's having been<br/>
during the day a distance of 20 miles.</p>",
42829.0,37,,"<p>I then went on to the top of the Kanyon through which runs Ash Creek. <br/>
[[Thomas Bullock|Thomas Bullock]] and [[Samuel F. Atwood|Samuel Atwood]] were with me. In about 2 hours <br/>
we rolled into the Kanyon <strike>about</strike> 1000 feet below about 50 tons of <br/>
rock. We rolled off one which would weigh about 5 tons. It fell <br/>
about 200 feet and struck a shaft of rock and took it with it and <br/>
falling into the Creek 800 feet below sent a sheet of water about fifty <br/>
feet into the air. We made a good deal of thunder for awhile <br/>
After wearying ourselves of this we returned to the fort</p>

<p>On our return we found the people assembled <br/>
in meeting. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] had spoken and also [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] <br/>
neither of which I heard. President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] was speaking when <br/>
I came in and [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] followed and the Spirit of God <br/>
was upon him and he prophesied many things</p>

<p>There was no report of any part of the meeting <br/>
only [[Thomas Dunlop Brown|T. D. Brown's]] minutes of President Young's speech which he <br/>
gave me and it is with our reports in the [[Historian|Historian's Office]]<br/>
Thomas Bullock and myself reported all the President's sermons <br/>
when we were present as we were appointed Historian and <br/>
clerk of the Camp.</p>

<p>Next day we rode back on the bench on our <br/>
return home 3 miles and the company stoped and President Young <br/>
located the new fort groun<strike>g</strike>d to be called [[Fort Harmony, Washington County, Utah Territory|Fort Harmony]] <br/>
Thomas Bullock took an account of it in his Journal. The <br/>
location was good and there was a great quantity of grass and <br/>
good soil. We rode to the Creek and nooned and thence <br/>
to [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Ced<strike>e</strike>ar City]]</p>

<p>About 20 miles south of the <strike>[[Virgin River, United States|Rio Virgin]]</strike> ^Fort Harmony^ <br/>
we descend rapidly a long distance into another climate on the <br/>
Rio Virgin. There was a kind of fruit there covering<br/>
thousands of acres which was very choice. Its flavor was <br/>
between a strawbury and cranbury. [[William Carter Staines|William C. Stains]]<br/>
had some of it growing in his garden</p>",
42829.0,78,,"<p>assembled in quarterly Conference at [[Farmington, Davis County, Utah Territory|Farmington]]. There were<br/>
present of the Twelve Apostles [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
and Wilford Woodruff; and of other missionaries [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo D Young]]<br/>
[[Gilbert Clements|Gilbert Clements]] [[Thomas Dunlop Brown|T. D. Brown]] and [[Richard Cook|Richard Cook]]</p>

<p>All the missionaries present had a cold<br/>
and a sore throat and they were all hoarse. It had come<br/>
on during the last 24 hours and it was a complaint that was<br/>
quite general among the people. Many hundreds men women<br/>
and children were at<strike>c</strike>tac<strike>t</strike>^k^ed in the same way. There was <br/>
no change in the weather nor anything on the outward appearance<br/>
of the elements to cause this general complaint</p>

<p>Elder Parley P. Pratt was quite unwell<br/>
He said he had not intended to preach this forenoon; but<br/>
he had to preach or go to bed. So he delivered a very <br/>
interesting discourse to the Conference for the space of<br/>
two hours and a half upon the birth life death and<br/>
resurrection of Jesus Christ. He took for his text<br/>
the ##Luke 2:10-11|10th and 11th verses of the II Chapter of St Luke##<br/>
""And the angel said unto them fear not for behold I<br/>
bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be<br/>
unto all people for unto you is born this day in the<br/>
city of David a Saviour which is Christ the Lord.""</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt in opening his discourse<br/>
gave some practical lessens upon the training of our children<br/>
in the history and knowledge of the Bible. He said<br/>
that one cause why he had taken that text was that a school<br/>
teacher in [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] had asked her whole school<br/>
where Jesus was born and not one of them could tell her. He<br/>
observed however that the children were small; but he urged<br/>
upon the Saints the importance of instructing even the smallest<br/>
children capable of understanding the history of the Prophets and <br/>
Apostles. He said by way of illustr[a]tion that every</p>",
42828.0,142,,"<p>September came and I soon began daily to make<br/>
preperations to leave the State of [[Maine|Main]] and our friends<br/>
and relatives in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] to lead a company of Saints<br/>
from the Islands of the sea to the land of Zion in<br/>
[[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]]. My [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child]] were to accompany me</p>

<p>It was the greatest trial Phebe ever had to<br/>
pass through, to take the parting hand of her parents<br/>
kindred and neighbours perhaps for the last time and<br/>
to go a journey of two thousand miles late in the fall<br/>
with our baby in the first stage of the [w]hooping cough<br/>
Add to this also that she was to leave a kind [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]]<br/>
house of plenty and go to a new country and settle<br/>
among strangers</p>

<p>These matters dwelt upon my wife's mind<br/>
and the persuasion of friends was also against her journey<br/>
under the trying circumstances. In fact it seemed at<br/>
times as though earth and hell were combined to crush<br/>
her troubled spirit and the sequel of our journey will<br/>
show that all this was like foreshadowings of that which<br/>
followed on our way</p>

<p>I cr<strike>y</strike>ied unto the Lord that she might<br/>
be supported under these and all other trials and I<br/>
soon found that the same Spirit which had<br/>
inspired her to embrace the fulness of the Gospel<br/>
and forsake her friends to go a journey of one thousand<br/>
miles to enjoy the society of the Saints—the spirit which<br/>
had also united her heart and hand to me and led<br/>
her to accompany me to the Islands of the sea was<br/>
with her still!</p>

<p>Yes Phebe possessed too much firmness and<br/>
faith and confidence in God to put her hand to<br/>
the plough and then look back or to wholy give<br/>
way to trials however great. Like [[Ruth (OT)|Ruth]] she was<br/>
determined to forsake kindred and country for my sake<br/>
and the cause in which we are engaged</p>

<p>As I beheld the spirit in her daily walk—<br/>
rooted in her heart and beaming in her countenance<br/>
my whole soul was bound to her in love stronger than<br/>
death such as we only feel in such circumstances.</p>",
42829.0,38,,""">10th of June</time> I rode to [[Fort Herriman, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Fort Herriman]] <br/>
with Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] [[Emma Smith Woodruff|Emma]] and [[Beulah Augusta Woodruff Beatie|Bulah]] and soon after our arrival<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] came. We none <br/>
of us had ever visited the place before. I thought <br/>
this the last location in the [[Utah Territory|Territory]] for a herd ground</p>",

that it should be baptized at that period of its life, because it had<br/>
been taught it by their parents and others. But, he said, was it not<br/>
for the name of Jesus Christ all our ordinances and administrations<br/>
would be of non effect and therefore our children should be thoroughly<br/>
taught concerning Jesus and his history.</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Gilbert Clements|Gilbert Clements]] preached<br/>
and in the evening [[Thomas Dunlop Brown|T. D Brown]].</p>

<p>On the Sunday [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] delivered an able<br/>
discourse upon the coming of Christ and read a revelation, from<br/>
the ##Doctrine and Covenants 49:22-23|Doctrine and Covenants##, given through [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Prophet to<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and others:</p>

<p>""Jesus Christ will not come in the form of<br/>
a woman, nor like a man walking upon the face of the earth<br/>
but look forth for the heavens to be shaken and the mountains<br/>
to be laid low &amp;c""</p>

<p>Orson Pratt after reading this revelation to<br/>
us then spoke of the work to be done previous to the coming<br/>
of Christ; also the first delivery of the Priesthood to Joseph Smith<br/>
by the Angel [[John the Baptist (NT)|John the Baptist]], the building up of the New<br/>
Jerusalem the Angels flying through the midst of the heavens<br/>
and the sounding of the trumpets as spoken of by [[John (NT)|John the<br/>
Revelator]] and the great day of the Lord's coming.</p>

<p>I have recorded a synopsis of this Discourse in my<br/>
Journal.</p>

<p>In the evening Elder Wilford Woodruff addressed<br/>
the congregation. Among other things he said:</p>

<p>""I am truly thankful that I have a mission<br/>
appointed me and in connection with Parley Pratt and Orson<br/>
Pratt two of the Twelve Apostles for it is the first time since<br/>
the organization of this Church and quorum that I have had<br/>
this privilege of being associated together with these two men</p>",
42828.0,143,,"<p>The devil had never tempted me to cease from doing<br/>
the will of God in not gathering to Zion or to cease travelling<br/>
and preaching the Gospel. I was therefore not inclined to stay<br/>
and enjoy the Society of my friends and kindred for in staying<br/>
I should have both ruined them and myself as touching the<br/>
Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Father]] and mother [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Carter]] and all my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife's]] brothers<br/>
and sisters had been uncommonly attentive and generous to<br/>
us during a year past but they could not see the propriety<br/>
of our gathering with the Saints. But we dared not let<br/>
this be an hinderance and I could only pray to God that<br/>
they might be brought to understanding and not lose their<br/>
reward for their great kindness to us.</p>

<p>I spent the 12th at Father Carter's packing<br/>
up the last remnants of our goods and on the next day<br/>
Phebe's father gave us one hundred dollars for which<br/>
sum we both signed a document to the effect that we<br/>
were satisfied and would hold no further claim to<br/>
any of his real estate or personal propety</p>

<p>About this time my mind was in suspence<br/>
because the camp of Saints did not arrive from the<br/>
Islands and I had not heard anything by letter from<br/>
them for some time past. The sickness of our [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|babe]] also<br/>
was an anxiety to us</p>

<p>On the 18 and 21st I received letters. In<br/>
the latter brother [[Nathaniel Thomas|Thomas]] informed me that the camp<br/>
would be ready to start in a few days. He wished me<br/>
to pray God to deliver them and enable them to go out<br/>
of Babylon. Truly it was a day of trial all round to<br/>
those who were seeking to go up unto Zion.</p>

<p>Several days afterwards I saw a report in<br/>
the Portland Transcript against the Mormons in [[Daviess County, Missouri|Davis<br/>
Co.]] Mo. which grew out of the fact that our brethren<br/>
claimed their privilege as American citizens and cast their<br/>
votes at an election. Numbers were rising up among the<br/>
Gentiles in the different counties to go over to Davis Co<br/>
and mob the Saints. All these reports had a tendency<br/>
to dampen the minds of those who were about to start<br/>
for the bosom of the Church. But none of these matters</p>",
42829.0,39,,""">14th</time> we had a hard rain storm and a great deal <br/>
of heavy hail fell. One child was drowned and another nearly killed <br/>
A cloud broke and the water came down in torrents. It washed away <br/>
much of the city wall and much damage was done to houses and <br/>
gardens. On [[Little Cottonwood, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|little Cottonwood]] the hail cut everything down <br/>
Gardens corn and wheat were destroyed. It was also the same <br/>
at North Cottonwood. Nearly all the glass was broken out <br/>
of the windows</p>

<p>With Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and most of my family the <br/>
next day I drove my waggon to [[South Weber, Davis County, Utah Territory|South Weber Fort]] and we spent <br/>
the night at brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington's]] with whom I spent the following <br/>
day and preached to the people upon the subject of walling in <br/>
their city and educating their children; and to the sisters I spoke <br/>
about forming a female society to make clothing to clothe <br/>
the Indian woman and children</p>

<p>Returning to Great Salt Lake City next day <br/>
we nooned at brother [[Ezra Thompson Clark|Ezra Clark's]] and I saw his carriage (top <br/>
and sides) was cut to pieces with the hail. Hail there fell <br/>
as large as a small hen's egg. We rode through one hail <br/>
drift two feet deep washed by the water down the creek</p>

<p>On the Sunday [[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] and [[Orson Hyde|Orson <br/>
Hyde]] preached in the forenoon and in the afternoon <br/>
Elder [[Thomas Bullock|Thomas Bullock]] gave an account of his mission to the <br/>
Shushonees</p>

<p>On the Monday President Young and company </p>",
42829.0,80,,""">1st of November</time> I rode to [[South Weber, Davis County, Utah Territory|South Weber]] and we did not<br/>
arrive till a late hour. It was very dark. We got lost<br/>
in the bluffs and came very near running our carriage off a<br/>
steep bluff. I went to the fort got a pilot and lantern<br/>
and we arrived in safety. The people were assembled<br/>
for a meeting. I spoke to them for a short time and<br/>
spent the night with Orson Pratt at brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington's]].</p>

<p>Next day we rode to [[Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Ogden City]] and met<br/>
with the people in the capacity of a quarterly Conference.</p>

<p>We had a strong wind through the day<br/>
and night. It was the strongest gale we ever experienced<br/>
in these valleys. Much damage was done and many<br/>
adobie houses were blown down some unro<strike>f</strike>ofed fences laid<br/>
prosterate carriages and waggons mashed to pieces hay and <br/>
straw stacks blown over and many chimneys blown off</p>

<p>Next morning the people were gloomy in<br/>
consequence of the destruction by the wind which also continued<br/>
strong through that day and until the next which was Sunday</p>

<p>I reported all the discourses of the Elders<br/>
at the Ogden Conference. I left Parley Pratt preaching in<br/>
the afternoon of Sunday and rode to South Weber where I<br/>
preached in the evening to the people</p>

<p>In company with [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] [[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|Horace<br/>
Eldridge]] and [[Henry Harriman|Henry Herriman]] I rode to [[Tooele, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Tooele City]] to<br/>
hold conference. There were others of the missionaries<br/>
attening this Conference which continued several days</p>",
42829.0,40,,"""><u>June the 27, 1854</u></time></p>

<p>Ten years ago this day Joseph and Hyrum Smith <strike>was</strike> ^were^ martyred <br/>
in [[Carthage Jail, Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage jail]]; and on this day the Church held a special <br/>
Conference in [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] according to the adjournment <br/>
at the General April Conference</p>

<p>The Conference opened at 10 o'clock and there were <br/>
present the Presidency the Twelve the various quorums of the Church and <br/>
a large congregation.</p>

<p>In the morning President [[Brigham Young|Young]] preached one of <br/>
the most interesting discourses and in the afternoon Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] <br/>
gave an interesting and very minute description of the martyrdom <br/>
of Joseph and Hyrum and all the circumstances leading to that <br/>
solemn event in our history.</p>

<p>Conference continued during the next day <br/>
and President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] delivered a long address.</p>

<p>The following persons received missions abroad:<br/>
John Taylor of the Twelve to [[New York|New York]] and with him [[Nathaniel Henry Felt|N. H. Felt]] <br/>

and [[Joseph Craig|Joseph Cregg]] to [[Ireland|Ireland]].</p>

<p>A very important nomination was also made</p>",
42828.0,144,,"<p>moved me in my determination</p>

<p>The next day this article in the paper went<br/>
the rounds of the time among our friends and neighbours<br/>
They said it would not do for us to go ^and^ for that we should<br/>
be killed &amp;c if we did go</p>

<p>These fears formed no part of my trials<br/>
yet at no part of my time since I had joined the Church<br/>
was I subject to more care and suspence than now.<br/>
Yet I was never stronger in the faith.</p>

<p>But the case stood with me thus: The<br/>
Lord had commanded me to go to Zion spedily and while<br/>
I was setting myself about the undertaking the Devil and<br/>
his agents were using their combined extertions to hinder<br/>
me. I had been waiting for the Saints from the<br/>
Islands of the sea to accompany them until it was<br/>
very late in the season; the <strike>f</strike>Fall rains were upon us<br/>
and cold weather would soon set in and the minds of<br/>
the Saints around me were cast down and depressed<br/>
We had a dreary journey of two thousand miles before<br/>
us with no other prospect than to camp upon the cold<br/>
and damp ground. I had also a sick [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|infant]] of only<br/>
two months old to take with me and my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] whose<br/>
spirits at times felt severly the circumstances around us;<br/>
and when she suffered I suffered also. But thank God<br/>
she stood the trial like a brave woman</p>

<p>These were some of the things that made me<br/>
anxious at the time but I was determined to make the<br/>
journey before another Spring even if it was alone and on<br/>
foot and I had to b[u]y my bread by the way.</p>

<p>On the 28th I received a letter from brother<br/>
[[Nathaniel Thomas|Nathaniel Thomas]] in [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]] in which he said ""We are<br/>
almost ready, and shall start to-morrow morning."" This<br/>
cheered us.</p>

<p>Some days, however, passed before they arrived<br/>
and on the 3rd of October Elder [[James Townsend|Townsend]] started to look after<br/>
them and see why they did not get along.</p>

<p>On the next day at 2 p.m. our anxiety was<br/>
releived for the camp came in sight and I immediately<br/>
accompanied them to Sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss']] house where a busy scene ensued.</p>",

their prayer circle Elder Orson Pratt came into the room with us <br/>
long enough for us to shake his hand. He had walked some 30 miles</p>",
42828.0,145,,"<p>We immediately commenced nailing and painting the<br/>
wagon covers and preparing them against stormy weather. I discovered<br/>
that the company needed a leader. I laboured with them until<br/>
night and then returned to Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]]. It was an affecting time<br/>
to [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] as she was about to part from all her relatives.</p>

<p>We spent most of the ^next^ day in painting and preparing<br/>
our waggons for the journey.</p>

<p>At about 2 o'clock p. m. we bid our friends and relatives<br/>
farewell. Many tears were shed; but Mrs Woodruff manifested great<br/>
fortitude in parting from her father [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|mother]] family and friends<br/>
After our farewell to these and many of the neighbours who<br/>
were present I made a commencement to lead this camp<br/>
of Saints on their long journey.</p>

<p>Our company consisted of the following persons:<br/>
From [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Fox Island]] brother [[Charles Brown|Charles Brown]] and family;<br/>
from [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Fox Island]] [[Nathaniel Thomas|Nathaniel Thomas]] and family;<br/>

<p>The whole numbered 53 persons. We had with<br/>
us ten waggons and nineteen horses.</p>

<p>After being set in order we travelled 13 miles<br/>
to [[Kennebunk, York County, Maine|Kenebunk]] and camped for the night by a saw mill and<br/>
as we were not fully organized there was some bustle amongst<br/>
us at first.</p>

<p>It was for a moment a trial to my feelings<br/>
to take my wife with an infant at her breast into a cold<br/>
tent to sleep upon the ground; but after we had become<br/>
reconciled to it there was an invitation given her to spend<br/>
the night at a house which was accepted.</p>

<p>I laid down upon the bed I spread in the tent<br/>
and after two hours I got up to stand on guard. I sat up<br/>
the remainder of the night built a fire and by its light wrote<br/>
in my journal.</p>

and spent the next day, Sunday, there when we fully organized<br/>
our company and I was chosen their leader. [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]</p>",

time in the [[Utah Territorial Statehouse, Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|State House]] at Filmore. Both <strike>h</strike>Houses<br/>
organized and adjourned</p>

<p>Next day I met with the Council at<br/>
one o'clock and at 2 o'clock we met in joint session. The<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Governor]] appeared and delivered his Message. One<br/>
thousand copies of it was ordered to be printed and it<br/>
was resolved that one hundred copies of the Minutes of each<br/>
day should be printed for the benefit of the two houses<br/>
The Secretary [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Almon W. Babbit]] arose and insulted the<br/>
Assembly to a great degree by threatening that their bills<br/>
should not be paid if they printed that number, and<br/>
he wished to dictate to the Assembly what they should<br/>
do which was out of his province</p>

<p>The Governor arose and gave<br/>
the Sec<strike>t</strike>retary a severe lashing with his tongue and said<br/>
he ought to be kicked out of the house as a poor miserable<br/>
dog.</p>",
42829.0,42,,""">Sunday the 17th</time> the <br/>
subject came up in conversation concerning Orson Pratt publishing <br/>
the ""Seer"" and the doctrines in it</p>

<p>President Young said brother Orson ought not to <br/>
have published the marriage ceremony. It was sacred and one<br/>
of the last ceremonies attended to in the endowments and ought not to <br/>
have been given to the world</p>

<p>Brother Pratt said he thought it was no harm as <br/>
the plurality of wives and its doctrines were to be published to the world <br/>
and he should not have done it had he thought there had been the <br/>
least harm in it.</p>

<p>President Young said he was satisfied that brother <br/>
Pratt intended no wrong in it. He also said that the doctrine <br/>
taught in the Seer that God had arrived at that state where he could <br/>
not advance any farther in knowledge power and glory was a false <br/>
doctrine and that there never will be a time to all eternity when <br/>
all the Gods of eternity will cea<strike>c</strike>se to advance in power knowledge <br/>
experience and glory for if this was the case eternity would cease <br/>
to be and the glory of God would come to an end. Celestial beings <br/>
will continue to advance in knowledge and power worlds without end <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] would always be ahead of us. We should never catch up <br/>
with him in all eternity nor he with his leaders.</p>

<p>Brother Pratt also thought that [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] was <br/>
made out of the dust of the earth and he could not believe that Adam<br/>
was our God and the Father of Jesus Christ</p>

<p>President Young said that he was and that he</p>",
42828.0,146,,"<p>was to accompany us and [[Milton Holmes|he]] was appointed our Com</p>

<p>On the next day we continued our journey travelled<br/>
15 miles and camped in a beautiful medow</p>

<p>Fill up the interval from October 9 to Nov 2<br/>
with the journey and casualities of camp life including<br/>
a severe attack of something like the colera upon myself<br/>
and the sickness of several children [[Clara Newel Thomas|one]] of whom afterwards<br/>
died.</p>

<p>At this date our company began to seperate<br/>
Elder M. Holmes took steam boat at [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]] for [[Fairport, Monroe County, New York|Fairport]]<br/>
and after another day's travel brother [[Cyrus Starrett|Cyrus Sterrett]] and<br/>
his family and brother [[Daniel Whitley|W<strike>a</strike>hitley]] and family returned to the<br/>
city of Buffalo to spend the winter as the expence was<br/>
so great it was thought we could not all get to Zion. So<br/>
they stoped to labour and brother [[Nathaniel Thomas|Thomas]] let them have<br/>
a span of horses and a waggon to help them up in<br/>
the Spring.</p>

<p>Here it should be observed that in the very<br/>
starting of this company Nathaniel Thomas had cheerfully<br/>
steped forward to the assistance of the poor and invested<br/>
about 1000 dollars for waggons horses tents &amp;c to fit out<br/>
this company while others who possessed this world's goods<br/>
also, drew back and did not go with the poor lest they<br/>
should be under the necessity of assisting.</p>

<p>Journing onward to the 1<strike>4</strike>3th and we<br/>
were at [[Painesville, Geauga County, Ohio|Painsville]] where the Saints had been much persecuted<br/>
From this place the next day brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] walked<br/>
to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] to see brother Milton Holmes</p>

<p>We rested on the 15th on account of rain<br/>
but journeyed to [[Mantua, Portage County, Ohio|Mantanway]] on the following day and<br/>
spent the night at the Inn of [[Lewis Turner|Lewis Turner]]. Elders Holmes<br/>
and Townsend were with us again but Milton had made<br/>
up his mind not to go any further with us but to tarry<br/>
in Kirtland or in the regions around until the Spring</p>

<p>While at Kirtland brother Holmes had seen<br/>
several letters from [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] representing that there was<br/>
great trouble among the Saints caused by the inhabitants of<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] coming against them with armed force.</p>

<p>Next day, we left brother M. Holmes and</p>",

<p><u>""Arise and shine O Zion for thy light is come<br/>
and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee</u>."" [##Isaiah 60:1##]</p>

<p>I have always felt since I have been<br/>
called to preach to speak of the practical things of every day<br/>
life instead of some great mysteries along way ahead in<br/>
eternity which the people do not know and never will as the<br/>
things taught do not exist.</p>

<p>I felt in the beginning of my ministry<br/>
that I had no right to preach unless I was filled with the<br/>
Spirit of revelation and prophecy as the ancients; and I<br/>
feel the same to-day</p>",

42828.0,147,,"<p>continued our journey without any particular incident for the interval<br/>
of three days at which date we were brought to another seperation</p>

<p>On the 20th we made arrangements to further devide<br/>
our little company, as brothers [[Nathaniel Thomas|Thomas]] and [[James Townsend|Townsend]] w[ere] inclined<br/>
to stop by the way and winter</p>

<p>Our company was truly getting very small there being now<br/>
only brothers [[Ephraim Luce|Luce]] [[Charles Brown|Brown]] and myself and our families to continue<br/>
our way together but we felt united in spirit and determined<br/>
to go onward</p>

<p>That night we had a comfortable room at a Inn 7 miles<br/>
from [[Wooster, Wayne County, Ohio|Worster]]. We were by ourselves for the night; and while sitting<br/>
by the fire side Sister [[Lydia Maria Macomber Luce Markham|Lydia Luce]] related a dream that she<br/>
had on the night before. It was as follows:</p>

<p>She saw a small sun in the South and while<br/>
looking at the strange phenomenon there appeared a ring of blood<br/>
in the West. There also appeared directly several other rings<br/>
of blood of a larger size all encircling each other, forming<br/>
a ring within a ring. Soon following this a ladder of fire was seen<br/>
blazing in the heavens and it fell to the earth and broke into<br/>
two peaces. One part of the ladder had an iron plate fastened<br/>
to the end of it with something also attached to it. She said<br/>
that in her dream I went and picked it up and read it<br/>
and it contained the XV. Chapter of [[Isaiah (OT)|Isaiah]]. By reading<br/>
this chapter it will be seen that this ^is^ very typical of what<br/>
has to befall this Gentile nation in particular and the world<br/>
in general in the last days.</p>

<p>As we travelled along we were continually hearing<br/>
of the Mormon war as it was called and the inhabitants of<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] were persecuting and puting the Saints to death because<br/>
of their religion</p>

<p>On the 23rd [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] was attacked with a severe<br/>
head ache which terminated in the brain fever. Still we<br/>
travelled on daily though my wife suffered much from the<br/>
journey.</p>

<p>The first day of winter was a pleasent one as<br/>
far as the season of the year was concerned; but O the winter<br/>
of sorrow was trying to seize upon my soul. Our company<br/>
was much afflicted.</p>

<p>It was December the first and as we journeyed</p>",
42829.0,84,,"<p>In order to be quallified to preach we should<br/>
be filled with revelation. [[Brigham Young|I]] do not consider that any man<br/>
is qualified to preach the Gospel and sayings of the Prophets<br/>
unless he is filled with the Spirit of the Prophets</p>

<p>We are commanded to arise and shine<br/>
but for us to sit down and say we believe in this work, we<br/>
believe that Joseph was a Prophet and still not carry<br/>
out the work which we are commanded to do; not to build<br/>
up and beautify Zion we shall find that we shall miss<br/>
our aim, we shall not enter into the celestial Kingdom<br/>
we shall not enter through through the gates</p>

<p>We must show to the Lord that<br/>
we are willing to fulfil what he requires of us and this<br/>
we shall not do unless we are willing to arise and<br/>
shine. But how are we to do it? We have<br/>
got to build up Zion, we have got to make Zion<br/>
the most holy and polished refined and beautiful<br/>
place upon the face of the whole earth</p>

<p>Some may expect to see Zion<br/>
in all that beauty majesty and glory which God has<br/>
spoken of; but the people do not understand the things<br/>
of God. I will prophesy that unless this people will<br/>
arise and build up Zion as God has commanded them<br/>
they will be removed out of their place and another people<br/>
will be raised up in their stead who will perform the work<br/>
and this I will say in the name of God. I also say in<br/>
the name of the Lord that the descendants of [[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]] who<br/>
are among the Gentiles are the first born and they are the<br/>
first ones to receive the fulness of the Gospel in this<br/>
Dispensation; they are the first to be gathered together<br/>
and this work was not to be given to any other. In<br/>
the beginning of the Kingdom of God this has been done</p>",
42829.0,44,,""">Dec. 1st</time> where <br/>
I preached to the people and and spent the night with Bishop <br/>
[[Abiah Wadsworth|Abiah Wadsworth]] who presided there</p>",
42828.0,148,,"<p>we passed brother [[Nathaniel Thomas|Thomas]] by the wayside mending his wagon<br/>
that had broken down. Brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] was quite sick.</p>

<p>I had not passed this afflicted company but a few<br/>
miles before I was called to stop my horses for the purpose to<br/>
all appearence to allow my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]—my companion to breathe her<br/>
last and resign her spirit into the hands of the God who<br/>
gave it. I stoped the wagon in the street where to<br/>
those around it seemed that her death couch stood But<br/>
while two of our sisters were standing by her side to<br/>
witness the scene of her last moments the Lord was very<br/>
merciful for notwithstanding that it seemed that breath<br/>
had left her body and her spirit departed she revived<br/>
again. I then drove the horses a few rods further and<br/>
put up at an Inn in [[Eaton, Preble County, Ohio|Eaton]].</p>

<p>Here I stayed the night taking care of Phebe<br/>
and the [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|babe]]. Earnestly did I pray the Lord to<br/>
spare the life of my wife.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday December 2<sup>nd</sup><br/>
It was absolutely necessary to discontinue our journey and<br/>
I concluded that for awhile we would tarry until Phebe had<br/>
recovered her health in some degree or departed this life</p>

<p>This settled and the next part was to<br/>
remove from the In for our circumstane would not permit<br/>
our remaining there. I therefore carried her into the wagon<br/>
and drove two miles to the house of Mr Mc. Kinzie<br/>
and put up not knowing how long we should have to<br/>
tarry for Phebe felt as though she only had a breath<br/>
of life remaining.</p>

<p>During the day brother Thomas and his<br/>
little afflicted company passed us again. The [[Clara Newel Thomas|child]]<br/>
whom I have already mentioned who died on the road<br/>
was a daughter of brother Thomas. Elder Townsend<br/>
who was travelling with him was now also sick.</p>

<p>After getting my wife and things into the<br/>
house and my horse put out I devoted myself to the taking<br/>
care of my wife.</p>

<p>In the evening she called me to her bedside<br/>
and said that she felt as though a few moments more<br/>
would end her existence in this life</p>",
42829.0,85,,"<p>The Ephraimites are before [[Brigham Young|me]] <strike>to</strike>here to day. Now if I<br/>
<strike>was</strike> ^were^ to ask you if you are willing to do as you are told you would say<br/>
""Yes."" But let me tell you there is not one of you who is<br/>
willing to do as you are told.</p>

<p>I have given the people counsel for years pass<br/>
how to build their forts walls cities houses and to begin to beautify<br/>
and adorn Zion; but have the people done as I have told them<br/>
in these things. You may say these are of minor consequences<br/>
but let me tell you that if you are not willing to do the small<br/>
things that are necessary on earth then you are not willing <br/>
to do as you are told in heaven and you will lose your<br/>
glory and exaltation</p>

<p>Now do you not remember that I told <br/>
you years ago to go to and build up a beautiful city in<br/>
this [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|place]] but there has been but little done towards it. We<br/>
have many who have been in the Church for quite a<br/>
number of years and yet we have not a builder or architect<br/>
who knows enough to build the meanest house not even<br/>
a kitchen in the New Jerusalem. Then how can<br/>
we build up the New Jerusalem? I have told the<br/>
people all the day long to be prepared to build up this<br/>
city; and I will say that if we could take all the knowledge<br/>
that exist among every nation upon the face of the whole<br/>
earth and boil it down into an essence and put it all into<br/>
one man he would not know enough to lay the first stone ^in the<br/>
wall^ around the New Jerusalem to say nothing about building<br/>
the city and Temple</p>

<p>We have got to improve continually and<br/>
build up good cities and adorn and beautify Zion and<br/>

riches or gold you are not worthy to do the work of</p>",
42829.0,45,,""">4th</time> I was at [[North Willow Creek, Box Elder County, Utah Territory|Willow Creek]]. There</p>",
42828.0,149,,"<p>[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|She]] manifested great confidence in the cause she had embraced<br/>
and also exhorted us to confidence in God and to keep his commandments.<br/>
To appearence she was dying but as on the day before she again revived<br/>
I prayed with her and laid hands upon her and commended unto<br/>
our Father in Heaven. She slept some during the night.</p>

<p>Two days after Phebe was still very feeble and low<br/>
and I returned to [[Eaton, Preble County, Ohio|Eaton]] to get some necessaries for her. I also felt the<br/>
power of the Destroyer resting upon in the forepart of the day</p>

<p>In the evening Phebe for the first time during<br/>
her sickness began to lay hold on faith for her recovery. Her<br/>
confidence grew strong and we laid hold on faith together; and<br/>
together we confessed our sins before the Lord and covenanted to<br/>
keep his commandments.</p>

<p>I had with me some oil that was consecrated<br/>
in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] for my anointing. I again consecrated it for<br/>
the healing of the sick and bowed myself before the Lord<br/>
and prayed with my companion and anointed and laid<br/>
hands upon her in the name of Jesus Christ. Thanks be<br/>
to God our prayer was answered and the fever left her</p>

<p>Two days more and the voice of the Lord<br/>
was to us to arise and continue our way to Zion and<br/>
through the mercy of God Phebe was enabled to rise and<br/>
walk a little. She had been confined at this place four<br/>
days where we were treated kindly.</p>

<p>Five days farther on our journey and<br/>
where we put up at night we suddenly heard the sad news<br/>
of the death of my brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel H. Woodruff]] who died at<br/>
[[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]] Indiania on the 18th of October 1838 at 3 o'clock<br/>
in the morning.</p>

<p>In the paper was published an account of<br/>
the Administrator's sale of the property of my brother. It was<br/>
sold on the 4th of December for about three thousand dollars<br/>
Mr [[Robert A. Smith|Robert A Smith]] was his administrator</p>

<p>There was also in the same paper an<br/>
account of the horrid butchery of 18 Latter-day Saints in [[Daviess County, Missouri|Davis<br/>
County]] Missouri by a wicked mob</p>

<p>The next day I rode to Terrehaute Indiania<br/>
through the delightful scenery of that country and drove to what<br/>
was As<strike>h</strike>ahel H. Woodruff's book store. Instead of finding him there</p>",

removed out of their place</p>

<p>Every time we build a house or a city<br/>
we should better it. Everything around us should be<br/>
neat and clean.</p>

<p>Now look at this building for a school-house<br/>
The ground around this building should be prepared for <br/>
a play ground and should be kept neat and clean and<br/>
be prepared so as to make the children happy. Children<br/>
should be in a clean place. But how is it here. The<br/>
moment the children step out of door they see nothing<br/>
but filth all the day long. The minds of our children<br/>
while young are pure and they should not spend their time<br/>
in filthy places for it affects their minds and feelings<br/>
They should be in a clean place for they are visited<br/>
by the angels of God; but parents do not realize this although<br/>
it is true</p>

<p>You may say I do not have time to keep<br/>
my dwellings school-houses door yards &amp;c clean. No nor you <br/>
never will have till you die upon the same principle but you<br/>
should take time. Now it should not take a week till<br/>
[[Brigham Young|I]] would clean out my door yard; but the people in this [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|city]]<br/>

anything else that they ought to do</p>

<p>I had an interview with his clerk and made<br/>
enquiries concerning my brother's sickness and death but defered<br/>
attending to his business until the following day. It was<br/>
with difficulty that we could get entertainment in the [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|city]]<br/>
for the night but finally we obtained an empty house.</p>

<p>The next day December 13th I spent mostly<br/>
in enquiring into and attending to the affairs of my brother<br/>
Asahel. I learnt from Messrs Smith and Ray that he<br/>
died at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 18th of October and<br/>
that he was sick ten days and deprived of his reason<br/>
four days before his death. While in this state his<br/>
mind in its wanderings was principally upon his business<br/>
but he occasionally spoke of his friends. His disease was<br/>
the congestive fever on the brain.</p>

<p>They farther said that his mind for<br/>
several months previous to his death had seemed to them<br/>
occupied by some matters unknown to them. They was not<br/>
so well acquainted with the secret of this as I was for<br/>
I was corresponding with him and knew by his letters<br/>
that his mind was deeply interested upon the subject of the<br/>
Gospel and the Church of Latter-day Saints</p>

<p>Of his character they testified that he<br/>
was moral in his life temperate in his practises beloved<br/>
and honoured as a citizen and his loss deeply felt</p>

<p>Asahel was indeed a young man of very<br/>
excellent talents, firm and indipendent in mind and also<br/>
indipendent and liberal in his principals</p>

<p>I had not been privileged with an interview<br/>
with him for about seven years but we had corresponded<br/>
with each other by letter. He had a peculiar art in<br/>
letter-writing which gave much interest to all the productions<br/>
of his pen. Both of us had long anticipated much upon<br/>
our meeting but my hopes were thus suddenly blighted but<br/>

a row of willows to scare and stop the Indians as anything<br/>
there is here.</p>

<p>Remarks by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]</p>

<p>President Kimball followed and said:</p>

<p>I felt quite well in the forenoon but<br/>
I do not feel well this afternoon</p>

<p>I know what President Young has said is true<br/>
We have come here and we have dedicated this people and this<br/>
place to God.</p>

<p>Now do the people realize why we are here. No<br/>
they do not. We are here for the benefit of all Israel. We<br/>
have not come here for a salary. We have come here to do<br/>
the will of God and I will say that the yoke is off from our<br/>
necks, and it never shall be put on again, not on the necks<br/>
of this people; for if we do not do as the Lord wants us to do<br/>
he will raise up a people who will do it. I tell you that<br/>
God will smite any people who undertake to stop this work<br/>
and I say that what President Young has said is true</p>

<p>You know that our children have to<br/>
learn the Alphabet first. So it is with this people. The<br/>
things which God teaches us are small and simple in<br/>
many respects but they are just as necessary for us to<br/>
learn and practise as it is for the child to learn his<br/>
letters in order to understand the arts and sciences for<br/>
we have to learn and practise small things before we can<br/>
obtain and carry out the greater things of God</p>

up and adorn Zion. We should set out fruit trees</p>",

<p>On the last day of the year I looked over my Journal <br/>

to have done but I have raised some 15 bushels of peaches<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] has a large orchard. He has raised a good<br/>
many peaches and apples and some thousand pounds of good<br/>
grapes as good as I ever tasted; and [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] is<br/>
as hard a place to live in as there is in these mountains<br/>
My wood for one fire cost me some 175 dollars</p>

<p>These Kanyons are full of good fruit which<br/>
you can get and set out. I have several kinds of good currents<br/>
which I got from the Ka<strike>y</strike>nyons which bear large and fine<br/>
fruit. These things all help to adorn the earth</p>

<p>Now go to and build up this place and<br/>
make a beautiful [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|city]]. You have a good place around<br/>
the [[Utah Territorial Statehouse, Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|State House]] for a city and gardens and orchards. The<br/>
soil is sandy and you have plenty of manure to make it rich</p>

<p>The people must learn and practise<br/>
cleanliness in this life. Some people think they can live all<br/>
their days in filth and dirt never even washing their bodies, then<br/>
die and go to heaven and be clean. But if you do not<br/>
learn and practise cleanliness in this life you will have to learn<br/>
and practise it in the next before you are received into the<br/>
society of those who are clean pure and holy.</p>

<p>You have got to be passive in<br/>
the hands of God. As the Prophet has said if we <br/>
are not passive in the hands of God as clay is in the hands<br/>
of the potter we shall have to be cut off from the whe<strike>a</strike>el and<br/>

be made vessels of honour. What can we be made vessels of<br/>
honour <strike><span class=""unclear"">[illegible]</span></strike>after we have been mared in the hands of the potter<br/>

upon the subject of mens judging each other. He<br/>
said he reproved men for their acts, but he was not<br/>
prepared to cast men down into hell for their imperfections<br/>

were called upon and found to be mostly full. He then called<br/>
for a subscription from the Seventies but he got but little</p>

""There are some things that grieve me. President Young was<br/>
asked if it would not be well to send the Presidents of the Seventies<br/>
out. He said no. They would preach the people to sleep<br/>

to sleep and then to hell then this body of counsellors are guilty<br/>
of sins either of omission or commission and I would advise<br/>
Joseph Young to cut off his coun<strike>se</strike>cil and drop them and<br/>

<p>It is our duty to make every sacrifice that is<br/>

all just men who sit enthroned in glory and power and dominion<br/>
may look upon us in the character; that is that they may see in their<br/>
kingdoms that we are willing to make every sacrifice (if [[Brigham Young|I]] may<br/>
call it a sacrifice) and not looking to man in order that we may<br/>
secure a seat with them in eternal light and glory. But<br/>
notwithstanding all the light and knowledge we have of life and<br/>
salvation do you not see how easy it is for us to turn away<br/>

I now regret and it is so with all those who have the light<br/>

when I am tempted and tried: I cannot help giving way to my<br/>

sware and I cannot help it. But [[Brigham Young|I]] can tell you, you can<br/>

are under obligation to confess our faults. It would be a hard<br/>

<p>You should be goverened by righteousness.<br/>
Let every Elder in Israel look upon his brethren and sisters like<br/>
little children. When a person does wrong in his foolish weakness<br/>
look upon it as such.</p>

<p>We see the children of men laboring hard to obtain<br/>
wealth. They labor night and day to obtain this object. But wealth<br/>
will not give you wisdom; but if you will shun evil and extend the<br/>
hand of charity to every living being and do good to all as far as<br/>
you have an opportunity. This will grow in you and you will<br/>
increase in wisdom and knowledge</p>

<p>We should live so as to enjoy the Spirit of<br/>
revelation that we may know the will of God concerning us in<br/>
all things. You should not live for yourselves alone for<br/>
if your affections are not placed on the Lord Jesus Christ and you<br/>

I visited President Young. We found him feeble but<br/>

He was taken very severely on the evening of the 14th with<br/>
pain in the kidneys and bowels and he nearly fainted away<br/>

for him and he began to recover. The Brethren felt that<br/>

he is filled with the Spirit of revelation of the holy Ghost and of the<br/>
Holy Priesthood: then he can magnify his calling and do his duty<br/>

He received this covenant from the Lord and desired to see<br/>
it fulfilled upon the earth</p>

<p>Abraham was driven from his father's<br/>

so wicked that no man would receive him; but the Lord<br/>
promised him a Seed through whom the Holy Priesthood should<br/>
be perpetuated forever and that to the increase of his seed<br/>
there should be no end. The Lord promised to Abraham<br/>
this great blessing. A man can have no greater blessing<br/>
than was promised to him; that he should have children<br/>
who should have the Priesthood. I would not ask for<br/>
any greater blessing than this for myself</p>

I found him in company with Bishop [[Allen Taylor|Taylor]] [[John Sharp|John Sharp]]<br/>
and others making a contract about digging the tunnel to take<br/>
out [[Weber River, Utah Territory|Weber River]] into [[Davis County, Utah|Davis County]]. The following conversation<br/>
took place:</p>

<p>President Young said, he would not undertake this<br/>
job unless the Bishops would bind themselves to pay as fast<br/>
as we get the lumber for them; and I want $1000 pay<br/>
kept in advance and the people must back this matter<br/>
up. Brother Taylor said they would do it. The</p>",

mile and a quarter long</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] asked Brother [[Allen Taylor|Taylor]] <strike>of</strike>if<br/>
he wanted us to commence this job and go on with it?</p>

<p>Brother Taylor said I do</p>

<p>President Young said to [[John Sharp|John Sharp]] are you<br/>
prepared to take hold and boss this job, as I cannot attend<br/>
to it.</p>

<p>Brother Sharp said he would</p>

<p>""Now Brother Taylor you go and get your hands and<br/>
go to that dam and build that and do it well. Do not<br/>
trust any man to boss that job who is not well acquainted with<br/>

about this job. Get you a gang of hands and say to them<br/>
Now I will give you so much interest for doing so much on<br/>

them and have the Canal staked off and say to the companies<br/>
that those who get their job done first they shall have a<br/>

time. He looked nearly worn out</p>

<p>At the close of President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball's]] remarks which<br/>
followed he called upon all the horse teams in the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]] and [[Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|county]]<br/>
to go into the Mountains and pick up the companies who were<br/>
coming with hand-carts and bring them into the city. One hundred<br/>
and fifteen were raised in a few minutes and all were prepared to<br/>
start in the morning. They were to take grain to feed them<br/>
with. President Young was unwell and not at the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]].</p>

<p>At the prayer circle the subject came up concerning the<br/>
emigration starting so late that it had cost the [[Utah Territory|Territory]] more</p>",
42829.0,160,,"<p>than it would to have bought oxen and brought them through for we<br/>
have had to send some two hundred and fifty teams out to meet<br/>
the<strike>m</strike> emigration and to send some twenty tons of flour and many<br/>
thousands of dollars of shoes and clothing.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] asked why they were so late<br/>
Brother [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin Richards]] said that Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] wanted to control<br/>
the emigration and means and would not take hold and assist in<br/>
the work without</p>

<p>President Young said that Brother Taylor was a good<br/>
man in many respects but he was not fit to handle means any<br/>
more than a child. ""I am going to inform all the churches<br/>
people and agents next season who do not take my counsel<br/>
that they shall be suspended from the Church</p>

<p>Elder Taylor said that the Handcart companies<br/>
could not be forwarded short of £12 (pounds) which would <br/>
not do at all.</p>

<p>President Young observed to Franklin Richards<br/>
""You had your possitive instructions what to do but<br/>
John Taylor <strike>but</strike> stood in your way and you did not do<br/>
as you were told and the people were sent <strike>to^o^</strike> ^so^ late that it<br/>
cost us many thousand dollars to get them in. Now what<br/>
do you think of such things</p>

<p>Elder Franklin Richards said the only<br/>
excuse I have to offer is that [[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] was dead<br/>
and John Taylor took charge of all things in the States and <br/>
informed me that he had instructions from President Young to<br/>
attend to it which it appears was not correct. Elder Taylor<br/>
wanted to handle the money himself which was wrong.</p>

<p>I met with President [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]] and all the<br/>
Missionaries at the house of Franklin D. Richards</p>

to the Missionaries</p>

<p>""I want you to go through the [[Utah Territory|Territory]] and do what<br/>
God wants you to do. Go prepared for battle. When it is necessary<br/>
jerk men up by their <strike>mains</strike> ^names^. Wake up the Bishops and all presiding<br/>
officers and then the people.</p>

<p>""Now we want to know what all men are doing throughout<br/>
this Territory. The people are dirty: we want them to reform in this<br/>
thing. Many do not treat their children right but use them roughly<br/>
Now if a man has the Spirit of God he will use his children well and<br/>
treat them kindly. I can tell you that children are very sensative<br/>
and the treatment which they meet has a great effect upon them</p>

<p>We want to see to that the people are employed<br/>
The reason why we prosper in this [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]] more than in any other is that<br/>
we labour.</p>

<p>I went to [[Taylorsville, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|^Taylorsville^]] with [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] and the people<br/>
was so dead and bad that brother Joseph wanted to go home<br/>
and not stop. I told him I would not go until I converted<br/>
that people and I stayed until I ^had done it and they had^ got the Spirit of God. Then<br/>
I conqurerd the people. So at the city [[Bountiful, Davis County, Utah Territory|Bountiful]]. I preached<br/>
there until the Spirit stoped there for days but at first the<br/>

Express had come in from the Handcart company and I went<br/>
to the President's and met with all the Presidency. The following<br/>
is a synopsis of what I learned</p>

<p>Brother [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph A. Young]] and [[George Davis Grant|George D. Grant]]<br/>
parted. They agreed that they should not go any farther<br/>
than the [[Devil|Devil's Gate]] until George came up. He did not<br/>
find the company so Joseph A. then went on to the [[Platte River, Nebraska Territory|Platte]]<br/>
and found them at the Upper <strike>c</strike>Crossing of the Platte. They <br/>
were in camp and had been nine days waiting for the<br/>
snow to go off. Soon brother George D. Grant<br/>
arrived and prepared the camp for moving. He asked</p>",
42829.0,165,,"<p>[[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph]] what would his [[Brigham Young|father]] do now if he was here^?^ Joseph A. Young said <br/>
""If my father was here he would take all the books and heavy materials and<br/>
cache them in order to save the lives of the people."" So they agreed to do<br/>
it; and they cached all their articles at [[Devil|Devils Gate]] and took up the<br/>
weak and the feeble and started towards home</p>

<p>They then sent an express back to have the teams<br/>
come on to them that was on the road. But brother [[John Van Cott|Vancott]] and<br/>
[[Claudius Victor Spencer|Claudius Spencer]] had got to the [[Sweetwater River, Nebraska Territory|Sweet Water]] and not hearing anything<br/>
from the Handcart companies they turned back with their teams<br/>
and nearly all the companies followed them. This news arrived<br/>
in the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]] several days since and an express was sent back to<br/>
turn them again to meet the handcart companies</p>

<p>All the companies out of the emigration were<br/>
together when the brethren found them. There were two ox<br/>
trains and the handcart train. Many of the old oxen had<br/>
died but the young oxen many of them were fat and fine</p>

<p>Brother [[Thomas Tennant|Tenant]] who had bought President<br/>
Young's place was dead. He died near [[Scotts Bluff, unorganized U.S. Territory|Scott's Bluffs]]. The<br/>
people were suffering with cold and hunger <strike>some</strike></p>

<p>[[David Patten Kimball|David Kimball]] and others went ahead<br/>
picked out camp grounds made up fires shovelled off the snow<br/>
and when the camp came up they would take the old men<br/>
women and children who could not walk and carry them to the<br/>
fires and help them get supper and then they would dance<br/>
around the fires and sing and shout to keep up the spirits of the<br/>
people; and while journing during the day they would wade over<br/>
all the streams and drag the handcarts over and carry all the<br/>
lame women men and children over</p>

<p>When [[William H. Kimball|William Kimball]] met with brother<br/>
Vancott he took one pair of his mules and put on to his own<br/>

the inhabitants to take the people into their houses and nurse them<br/>

<p>I called upon President [[Brigham Young|Young]] at his office. He had<br/>
been down to lay h<strike>ed</strike>ands upon President J. M. Grant who<br/>
lay very low. His lungs appeared to fill and he had<br/>
no power to raise anything from his lungs. It appeared<br/>
that he could not live but a short time unless there was<br/>
a change soon for the better. He said he felt as<br/>
though he wanted an apple some grapes or wine<br/>
or something upon his stomach. President Young<br/>
sent him down some and they roasted an apple an<br/>
he eat it about 12 o'clock and seemed to relish it well<br/>
He also drank some buttermilk which he relished<br/>
but it was a death appetite</p>

<p>The missionaries met at the [[Historian|Historian's office]]<br/>
and soon President Young came in and opened the meeting<br/>
with prayer. [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] made a short report<br/>
or address and was followed by Wilford Woodruff who<br/>
expressed his feelings in great plainness concerning the<br/>
people taking off from the President a part of the burden<br/>
which was resting upon him for he was wearing out<br/>
Then all the missionaries who were sent to the different<br/>
Wards were called upon to report. All made their<br/>
reports and spoke encourageingly of the reformation.<br/>

thrown open for the people to visit the corps and preparations<br/>
^were made^ for his funeral. Many thousands went through the house <br/>
to visit the body. At half past nine the military began<br/>
to form in open line from the residence to the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] and three<br/>

staff General Grant^'s <strike>and</strike> staff^ and all the lancers were in attendance and<br/>
a company of York masons formed in the procession. The<br/>

many could not get in. But it took so long to get through<br/>
with the ceremonies of the morning that it was ten minutes</p>",
42829.0,171,,""">6th</time> I attended meeting of the Bishop<br/>
and council and Priesthood of the Fourteenth Ward at 2 o'clock.<br/>
[[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] was present. I sat and heard the report<br/>
of the brethren and when I was requested to speak by ^the^ [[Abraham Lucas Hoagland|Bishop]]<br/>
I arose and said that <strike>as</strike> the Bishop and missionaries had<br/>
appointed men as Teachers to the Gentile stores to preach<br/>
the Gospel to them but the Spirit said to me that it was not</p>",
42829.0,172,,"<p>wisdom to send men <strike>to</strike>as Teachers to the Gentile stores to preach<br/>
the Gospel to them. I considered they were wicked and<br/>
corrupt and it was like casting pearls before swine. When <br/>
I closed [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] backed me up and bore testimony<br/>
that what I said was true</p>

<p>Then the Bishop arose and opposed me<br/>
very strongly and said that he presided over the Fourteenth Ward<br/>
and he had sent the Teachers to preach to the Gentiles and he<br/>
wished them to go and do it.</p>

<p>I saw that the Devil had ensnared him.<br/>
When he sat down the Teacher arose and said What shall I<br/>
do. Brother Woodruff says do not go to the Gentiles and Bishop<br/>
[[Abraham Lucas Hoagland|Hogland]] says go. I arose and said obey your Bishop<br/>
for he says he will take the responsibility upon himself in<br/>
sending Teachers to the Gentile stores. Many of the<br/>
Priesthood were fired up upon the subject but the meeting<br/>
closed and we went home</p>

<p>Brother Richards and myself went up<br/>
to President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] and we related what had taken place with<br/>
ourselves and Bishop Hogland; and President Young was <br/>
astonished at the position which the Bishop had taken. He<br/>
said the Devil was leading him into difficulty and he could<br/>
not extricate himself without help. He immediately<br/>
sent for Bishop Hogland who came up and the subject was<br/>
talked over and President Young showed his error and<br/>
he saw and confessed it. President Young told him<br/>
that the Twelve held the keys of the Kingdom of God in all<br/>
the world where the Presidency are not and that no Bishop<br/>
presided over any one of the Twelve in any place. The<br/>
Bishop made his confession and went home.</p>

<p>I have related this as an example<br/>
of a principle that none might err and not as reflection</p>",
42829.0,173,,""">Dec. the 8th 1856</time>.</p>

<p>Brother Woodruff has given us a good testimony—a living testimony<br/>
in the Spirit and power of the Holy Ghost. Now any of<br/>
the rest of you who have the Holy Ghost arise and speak to us<br/>
those things which will edify</p>

<p>-[ [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|B. L. Clapp]] and [[Edwin Dilworth Woolley|E. D. Wooley]] then spoke for a few<br/>
moments and then President Young continued]-</p>

<p>I don't expect to speak much to night. I have<br/>
learned to govern myself in talking as well as in other things.<br/>
It may be asked if this a new work. It is not a new work</p>",
42829.0,174,,"<p>but our reformation is the work we begun in when we embraced<br/>
the Gospel. [[Brigham Young|I]] have pointed out the errors of the people all the<br/>
time and shown the people their faults and told them what to do<br/>
But here is the difficulty: As soon as the Elders come home from<br/>
their missions in a few days they lay down their armour while they should<br/>
keep it on all the time and keep it bright but their minds are engrossed<br/>
with the things of the world and they lie down and go to sleep. Their <br/>
only ambition is to know how they can get this house built or to get<br/>
a farm horses cattle &amp;c. Their whole soul is in the work of the<br/>
world and not the building of the Kingdom of God. But any<br/>
man who gets property upon this principle it will corode him. He<br/>
has not wisdom to use it</p>

<p>I have to<strike>e</strike>ld the people a hundred times they<br/>
do not know how to get rich. The way for the people to get<br/>
rich is to do the will of God and they must be governed by the<br/>
revelations and Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Brother Woodruff has told us here to night<br/>
how it is. When I look upon the conduct of the people before<br/>
the reformation commenced as I was teaching them the way of<br/>
salvation daily and they would not give heed. It pained my <br/>
heart and I felt as if I should die; but when brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah M<br/>
Grant]] steped forward and took the burden off from me I was<br/>
relieved but <u>it has</u> <u>cost him</u> <u>his life</u>. Had he not have taken<br/>
that burden upon him he would have lived a few years longer in<br/>
our midst.</p>

<p>I have felt that unless the people would awake and live<br/>
their religion I must go down to the grave. But the burden of<br/>
this people was taken from me and it rested on him and it has<br/>
not yet returned to me although he is dead. Should it return<br/>
to me as it has been <u>I shall soon follow him to the grave</u> <u>for I<br/>
could not</u> <u>live long with that weight</u> <u>upon me</u></p>

<p>When you first received the Gospel was not</p>",
42829.0,175,,"<p>your hearts filled with love? <strike>a</strike>And did you not put on the Gospel armour and<br/>
would it not have continued with you <strike>all the time</strike> if you had lived your<br/>
religion all the time but you have had hard feelings in your hearts<br/>
<strike>and</strike> against your neighbor; but if the Spirit of God continued with<br/>
you it would <strike>have overcome; it would</strike> have overcome those evil feelings<br/>
And what if we were all to put our armour off and partake of the spirit of <br/>
anger and hatred? God would spew us out of his mouth and we should<br/>
go down to hell together and he would raise up another people to do his<br/>
will.</p>

<p>After all the stupor that has rested upon this people they have been<br/>
gaping for more revelation. [[Brigham Young|I]] do not mean one man but I mean<br/>
the whole people, while they have already a great deal more than they<br/>
are worthy of and if this people do not wake up and live their religion<br/>
the <u>Lord will take away the sources of revelation which they now<br/>
have from the people</u>. It is not a few men who have got to live<br/>
their religion but it is the whole community. If we as a people<br/>
will return unto the Lord I know he will receive us with open arms</p>

<p>I am glad that this Winter has commenced without<br/>
fidling and dancing. But would there be any harm in going<br/>
into the hall and having a dance if we felt right and kept the Spirit<br/>
of God with us? No there would not. But as soon as we<br/>
should opon this door how many would keep the amour on and<br/>
live their religion and keep the Spirit of God. Not many.<br/>
Some would but many would say come let us go and take a drink<br/>
and begin to get the liquor in them and they would say, ""Come<br/>
brother Brigham I am ready for anything; stand out of the way<br/>
here: Hurrah for hell; sware a little damn a little; steal a little<br/>
gamble a little and raise the devil</p>

<p>But we will stop fidling and dancing until<br/>
the brethren get power to overcome these things and keep them under<br/>
their feet. I do not intend to start dancing again until the<br/>
people will learn to do right and live their religion. I have to war</p>",
42829.0,176,,"<p>with the weaknesses of man. [[Brigham Young|I]] am encompassed with it. I know<br/>
what it is to fight it all the time. If you are going to continue a reformation<br/>
make up your minds to live your religion. If the people will do this<br/>
it will be as brother Woodruff says: the darkness will pass away and<br/>
I can live long among this people and so can brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and other<br/>
men. But if this people will go on lying stealing swearing and<br/>
whoring I dont want to live but I want to leave the people and go<br/>
to God and let the wicked go to hell. I hope that God will send<br/>
the wicked who will not repent <strike>so</strike> down to hell quickly to be burned<br/>
up so that they may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus</p>

<p>When I first came into this Church I was<br/>
an enthusiast ^and^ though^t^ I would never ^keep an account—never^ put pen to paper and never<br/>
say this or that is mine, but it is the Lords. We never can be of<br/>
one heart and ^one^ mind until we can say that all that we have is the<br/>
Lord's and that we are only his servants and stewards to control it<br/>
according to his will.</p>

<p>When the Lord gives me property he gives me wisdom<br/>
to use it. We have individual rights and shall have to all eternity<br/>
What are those rights. If I have any property horses cattle waggons<br/>
or anything else my neighbor has no right to steal it from me<br/>
and if the people have the Spirit of the Lord they will know that<br/>
it is not right to take anything which belongs to another without<br/>
liberty but let it remain where it is.</p>

<p>We are accountable for our time to the<br/>
Lord. Now if you have a months leasure time and you gamble<br/>
that away and do not bring to pass any good you may just as<br/>
well throw away $20, and you are accountable for this waste<br/>
of time</p>

<p>I am often astonished at the follies of this people. Many<br/>
women are asking their husbands for some new thing. They<br/>
want a dozen new dresses and many unnecessary things<br/>
But what does a person want of a dozen new dresses. If this</p>",
42829.0,177,,"<p>people would ask for those things which are necessary and do right you<br/>
would soon see the people get rich. But what are you doing? Are you <br/>
rich? No. The Lord can send the grasshopers crickets and locust<br/>
They are his armies and can eat us up and kill our cattle. He can<br/>
give us much or little as he pleases. If our eyes are single to the<br/>
glory of God and we do our duty the Lord could make us as rich as<br/>
^Ceasar^</p>

<p>What would you do with it? Agrandize yourselves?<br/>
No you should not; but send out millions of men to gather the poor<br/>
and send mules loaded with gold to buy the nations. But now we<br/>
are poor and can accomplish but little</p>

<p>Now I am here with brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]. If<br/>
you wish to <strike>answer</strike> ^ask^ any question we can answer right; but for me<br/>
to teach the Bishops their duty is folly for I have taught them over<br/>
and over for years. Now if I was going to a Ward meeting to preach<br/>
and the Bishop was to oppose me unless it was my duty to reprove<br/>
him I should sit and laugh at him but not contend with him<br/>
<strike>but</strike> When there is any difficulty between a missionary and a <br/>
Bishop or any two men they should not contend about it before<br/>
the people but talk it over among themselves and settle all differences<br/>
of opinion in the Spirit of God and not labour for the mastery</p>

<p>Remarks Of President Heber C Kimball.</p>

<p>Brother Kimball followed President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and said</p>

<p>""I am one with President Young and so was [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M.<br/>
Grant]]. He took hold of the work with all his might to wake<br/>
up the people and it killed him. If President Young was to ask<br/>
me to go forth in the same way I would do it but it would cut short<br/>
my life as it did his. I have never felt as though Jedediah was<br/>
dead. The savio<strike>r</strike>ur said those that abide in me will never die<br/>
His spirit is with us and he can do more for us now than he could<br/>
before. The Spirit of God is poured out upon some m<strike>a</strike>^e^n mightily</p>",
42829.0,178,,"<p>The reformation is doing good and the people are doing better<br/>
and those who get the spirit of God will stand and those who<br/>
do not will fall. The people are forsaking their sins</p>

<p>There are things in embr<strike>y</strike>io which will <br/>
try this people and those events will ripen as this people do<br/>
and all will have to get the spirit and revelation of heaven in<br/>
order to stand. And these things will be among all nations<br/>
and they will know it as well as [[Heber Chase Kimball|I]] know it</p>

<p>It will be a hard Winter. I want<br/>
you to wake up yourselves and then wake up your wives and<br/>
children and stop your lying and stealing and take the<br/>
burdens upon your backs which belong to you that the<br/>
Presidency and Twelve may only have to carry their own burdens</p>

<p>The time has come or is near at hand that<br/>
many who have trifled with the Priesthood and the things of God<br/>
will be destroyed and go to hell; and those who are not faithful<br/>
in magnifying the Priesthood it will be taken from them and<br/>
given to others and that quickly and I know it for angels<br/>
Prophets and holy men say it and it will be fulfilled</p>

<p>As to dancing I am tired of it. I never<br/>
want to see another man dance until he can do it by the<br/>
power of God. I felt that Spirit once and brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>
shouted Hosanna for we were both filled with the Spirit.<br/>
Neither do I want to see any more feasting at present. I dont<br/>
want to see any more jealous feelings. Some of our Bishops get<br/>
jealous of the servants of God. No man would be if he was<br/>
filled with the Holy Ghost</p>

<p>I would chastize a man if he stood in my<br/>
way when I know that I am a messenger sent of God. President<br/>
Young says that if the people do not do right he will not stay<br/>
long with them but shall go the other side of the veil. If he<br/>
goes I shall not stay long behind him because we will not have</p>",
42829.0,179,,"<p>one between us and if you dont do your duty we shall go soon. [[Heber Chase Kimball|I]] have<br/>
had many men try to stand between me and President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and when<br/>
I have been to see him many have snubed me; but I have seen<br/>
enough of this; and that man who will try to do it must look out<br/>
for God and his angels will smite him</p>

<p>I have no objection to men coming to President<br/>
Young to comfort him and do him good and when he gives them a wife<br/>
to give him $10 or $20 according as the man may value his wife<br/>
but men must not try to seperate us. If they do they will be cursed</p>

<p>I understand that brother Woodruff got a whipping<br/>
from one of them lately; but I tell you that although he is a small<br/>
man he is all gold and you will find it so in the end. You may<br/>
be thankful to ever get as good a place as he will get for he is<br/>
the pure gold and I wish you would get as good as he is.</p>

<p>The Bishops will not respect what the missionaries<br/>
say for they are jealous. But if you will get the Spirit of<br/>
God upon you there will be no jealous feelings in your heart. You<br/>
want the Spirit of God and the power of the Priesthood to rest upon<br/>
you as it did upon [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and does upon the Presidency and Twelve<br/>
Take that Priesthood upon you which belongs to you and magnify<br/>
it.</p>

<p>The missionaries <strike>went</strike> ^want^ to wake up. Then wake up the<br/>
Bishops and then wake up the people and all live your religion<br/>
and all will go well <strike>and</strike> if you will live ^up to^ your privileges<br/>
here and get the spirit of this reformation. It will reach all<br/>
over the earth and go to the ends of the earth and the wicked<br/>
will not have power over us; but this work will go from [[Zion|Zion]]<br/>
through all the world as the sap of a tree will go from the<br/>
trunk to the end of every limb and twig</p>

<p>I want to see the power of God among<br/>
the people that they may have faith to remove mountains if<br/>
necessary but the power of God will only increase as the Spirit of</p>",
42829.0,180,,"<p>God increases among the people that they may have faith to remove<br/>
mountains</p>

<p>If we do our duty the United States should be the aggressers<br/>
The Lord would say if they came against us ""Let my servant [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>
send 200 men and they would lick them up for God would assist<br/>
to fight our battles with the storm hail and snow and they would<br/>
be destroyed. [[Heber Chase Kimball|I]] know this would be done but we must get the faith<br/>
of the ancients.</p>

<p>As to brother Brigham I have to say that he is just as good<br/>
a man as ever was on earth.</p>

<p>Now wake up brethren and purify yourselves<br/>
before you try to purify others. Then go forth and lift up your voice<br/>
like a trumpet and call upon all men to repent and get full of the<br/>
Holy Ghost and there is not a man who will do it but what will be<br/>
filled with prophesyings as were the ancient Nephites and little boys<br/>
of four years old will prophesy</p>

<p>I do not wish to go to a feast or a dance until<br/>
the people reform. There is men enough here to bring forth this reformation<br/>
and men will not prosper until they do their duty to God and each<br/>
other. I have no desire to attend any recreation until this people<br/>
are filled with the Spirit and power of God and I do not think that<br/>
President Young has. If you will rise up and do your duty you<br/>
will be blessed and no man that rises up against us in this place<br/>
will prosper if we do our duty and we wash our feet against them<br/>
I believe in washing our feet against our enemies</p>

<p>The Spirit of God has been upon us for<br/>
more than a year and the people would play laugh and trifle about<br/>
it but if they had had the Spirit of God and had done their duty<br/>
they would have seen it. This has been my feelings all the time<br/>
I have felt that the people were trifling with the things of God</p>

man is taken from us but his power is here. It still rests upon</p>",

had just arrived from [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|Filmore]]. The President soon came in<br/>
and they gave an account of their proceedings while at Filmore<br/>
The Legislature had met there organized passed some resolutions<br/>

adjourned to meet in G. S. L. City on the ^18th^ day of Dec. 1856.</p>",

as he was the President of the Twelve and awake up and get the<br/>
Holy Ghost and the Twelve will follow you in the field and<br/>
I called upon the people to awake and listen to the words of the <br/>
Presidency of the Church.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday Elder Hyde preached<br/>
upon the ^parable of the^ 10 Virgins; I followed him but was somewhat tied.<br/>
In the afternoon [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] spoke both<br/>
in the power of God. I followed and the Spirit of the Lord<br/>
rested upon me and I asked the people which they would do go</p>",
42829.0,184,,""">29^<sup>th</sup>^</time> [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and myself went up<br/>
to President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] Office where we found him [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
and [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]. I Wilford Woodruff told President Brigham<br/>
Young that we had drawn up a few lines for the Presidents of the<br/>
Seventies to sign. I also said to him that I would not ask<br/>
my brethren to do what I was not willing to do myself and inasmuch<br/>
as I received my Apostleship from your<strike>s</strike>e hands I now surrender<br/>
it unto you and throw myself into your hands and if there is<br/>
any other man in Israel that you think will fill my place<br/>
better than I do I will freely take it and not complain about<br/>
it. Elder Lorenzo Snow said the same thing to President Young<br/>
So also did Orson Hyde.</p>

<p>President Young replied, ""As for you brother<br/>
Woodruff and brother Snow I have never known you when<br/>
you more felt the responsibility of your Apostleship or was as well<br/>
qualified to magnify your calling as at the present time; but as<br/>
for you brother Hyde I will say if you do not magnify your<br/>
calling better than you have done I shall object to your standing<br/>
where you do if nobody else does for you have not had the spirit<br/>
of your calling upon you. You have been trying to build<br/>
yourselve<strike>s</strike> up and not the Kingdom of God""</p>

<p>I remarked yes brother Hyde the quorum <br/>
of the Twelve feel this and have felt it for a good while. We want<br/>
you to take hold and lead as you are our President. We want a<br/>
leader and if you will magnify your calling we will be with you</p>

<p>President Young also ^made^ some remarks upon [[Orson Pratt|Orson <br/>
Pratt's]] course disaproaving of his philosophy and order of reasoning</p>",
42829.0,185,,""">Dec. the 30th 1856</time>.</p>

<p>I met with the Legislative Council in the forenoon. President<br/>
Young was present and the Spirit of God was present. The ##John 15|XV<br/>
Chapter of St. John## was read and commented upon. It was<br/>
then moved that both Houses meet in joint session. We then<br/>
came together and speeches were made by Lorenzo Snow Wilford<br/>
Woodruff Brigham Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] and [[Hosea Stout|Hosea Stout]]</p>

<p>Among the remarks made by President Young<br/>
was that when the First Twelve were called he and brother Kimball<br/>
almost needed a stool in order to reach high enough to tie the shoes of<br/>
[[John Farnham Boynton|John Boyanton]] [[Lyman Eugene Johnson|Lyman Johnson]] and [[William Earl McLellin|W<u>m</u>. E. M<sup>c</sup>Lellin]] but now<br/>
they are gone and we remain. Brother Woodruff and Lorenzo<br/>
Snow say they never have felt the weight of their Apostleship and</p>",
42829.0,186,,"<p>responsibility as they do now. This I have known all the<br/>
time. If brother [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] feels the weight of his responsibility as an<br/>
Apostle to day I am glad of it for it is the first day of his life<br/>
that he ever did feel it.</p>

<p>Many other remarks were made and it was<br/>
finally moved that all the members of the Legislative body of the<br/>
[[Utah Territory|Territory of Utah]] repent of their sins and go to the Font at 6 o'clock<br/>
on the [[Salt Lake City Temple Block, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple Block]] and be baptized for the remission of their<br/>
sins which was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>The Legislature met at the Font as ordered<br/>
and they had to fill it with buckets from the [[City Creek, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Creek]]; and as the<br/>
Presidency and those of the Tw<strike>l</strike>elve at home had been baptized Elder<br/>
[[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin Richards]] went into the water and baptized Elder Orson<br/>
Hyde and some 17 others. Then [[James Willard Cummings|James Cummings]] went into the<br/>
font and baptized <strike>some 37</strike> the rest, also the missionaries 37 in<br/>
number.</p>

<p>We the Twelve then laid hands upon Elder Orson Hyde<br/>
and confirmed ^him^ <strike>Elder Orson Hyde</strike>, Wilford Woodruff was mouth<br/>
The Twelve also confirmed the whole company. I was mouth<br/>
in confirming 9 persons and I assisted in confirming 12<br/>
others</p>

<p>This was a new feature in Legislation. We believed<br/>
that if we could get the Spirit of God we could do business<br/>
faster and better than with the spirit of the devil or the<br/>
spirit of the world. There were 55 in all baptized.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year I met with<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and the Twelve and the missionaries at the<br/>
[[Historian|Historian's Office]] and we heard the report of all the missionaries<br/>
and a very interesting address from President Brigham Young<br/>
who spoke in the power of God upon our enemies and said<br/>
the Spirit of the Lord told him that inasmuch as he <br/>
had delivered us through all our troubles thus far while</p>",
42829.0,187,,""">22nd</time> I attended the Seventies<br/>
meeting. There were present of the Twelve Elder [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] Wilford<br/>
Woodruff [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]]. The first business that<br/>
was attended to was the trial [[George Philander Stiles|G. P. Stiles]] for adultery. He emphatically<br/>
denied it though the testimony was strong against him. [[Albert Perry Rockwood|A P. Rockwood]]<br/>
was in the stand and he did not know what to do with him. I bore<br/>
it as long as I could and then I arose in the Stand and said:</p>

<p>""George P. Styles, I am going to ask you a<br/>
question and if you are <strike>i</strike>^in^nocent you shall proclaim your <strike>i</strike>^in^nocence<br/>
but if you are guilty dont you deny it before God the Holy Ghost<br/>
and these witnesses. If you do the judgements of God shall<br/>
follow your footsteps from this hour till you go to your grave<br/>
and from thence to hell.""</p>

<p>I put the question and he did not deny it nor<br/>
acknowledge it so he was cut off from the Church.</p>

<p>All the members of the Twelve present then spoke<br/>
and the power of God rested upon us like fire shut up in our<br/>
bones and many things were revealed to us. We advised the<br/>
Presidents of the Seventies to go forward and present their resignation<br/>
to President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and let men take their places who could<br/>
magnify the office</p>

<p>On the following day I met in the Legislative<br/>
Council. There was no spirit to transact business. Lorenzo<br/>
Snow moved that President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] should give us an address</p>

<p>President Kimball said, ""I do not feel much<br/>
like speaking to day. I feel feeble in body and want my liberty<br/>
to act as I am moved upon by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>But he began to talk and the power of God</p>",
42829.0,188,,"<p>came upon [[Heber Chase Kimball|him]] and he spoke for an hour. I followed him and the<br/>
room was filled as with consuming fire and all the members of the<br/>
house came in and they all spoke until sundown and the house<br/>
was filled with the Spirit of God almost to the consuming of our<br/>
flesh and many things were revealed which were marvellous</p>

<p>I attended the Bishops meeting in the evening<br/>
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] W. Woodruff [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] of the<br/>
Twelve were present and the fire of God was still with us. I <br/>
never spent such a day and night in Israel before.</p>

<p>Next day I reported to President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
what we had done in relation to the Presidents of the Seventies and<br/>
Judge [[George Philander Stiles|Stiles]] in cutting him off for adultery and President Young<br/>
approved of what we had done. He also told me to go<br/>
through the city and remove all the stumbling blocks I could and<br/>
where I found a Bishop or any other man who was in his way to <br/>
remove him and put a better man in his place.</p>

<p>The Great Reformation of the Church which extended throughout<br/>
the world among the Churches and missions commenced about the<br/>
middle of the year and cost [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah M. Grant]] his life through<br/>
his zeal and labors.</p>

<p>It is right that we should meet together often to pray sing preach and<br/>
receive instruction in order to assist us to live our religion; but none<br/>
of these things or any of the ordinances of the Gospel which we administer<br/>
to the children of men or to each other benefit the Lord. Our worshiping<br/>
the Lord is no particular benefit to our Father in heaven; but it is all<br/>
entirely for our own benefit and in this light we should view it</p>

<p>There is a doctrine taught from the Stand and<br/>
frequently taught in public that we should follow Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] or<br/>
Brother Brigham or any man who leads and do as they say and obey<br/>
them and that is all that is required; but this is a false doctrine in one<br/>
sense. For I will say no man should trust to the testimony<br/>
of another but he should go to ^God^ and get the testimony for himself.<br/>
This every man and woman should do.</p>

<p>I might have heard Joseph Smith preach and<br/>
testify of the truth of the Book of Mormon and this work until he<br/>
had been as old as [[Methuselah (OT)|Methuselah]] and in the end I should have<br/>
snaped my fingers at him and said to him you are a foolish<br/>
old man and turned upon my heels and walked off if I had<br/>
not have had some other testimony besides his; but I went to the<br/>
Lord and the Lord revealed to me that it was true and that it was<br/>
his work and I received it upon that principle, I have<br/>
lived upon that principle from that day to this</p>

<p>It is the right privilege and duty of every man<br/>
and woman to get the revelation of Jesus Christ for themselves and</p>",
42829.0,192,,"<p>every person should get the Spirit of God and live by it and if all<br/>
would do this there would not be a man ^or woman^ unhappy in this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] and<br/>
the flood of complaint which now salute my ears of husbands and wives<br/>
complaining of each other would be done away</p>

<p>One man comes and says my family will not<br/>
be subject to me. Another woman says my husband abuses<br/>
me and I want a bill to get away from him and a thousand complaints<br/>
come pouring in upon me none of which I should hear if the people<br/>
lived by the Spirit of God. You should all obtain the Spirit <br/>
of God and overcome your passions.</p>

<p>When you get angry you should put a piece<br/>
of Indian rubber in your mouth and bite it until you could get <br/>
perfect control over your passions. Do not speak while you<br/>
are angry for you will say something that you will be sorry for<br/>
but if you will keep your thoughts to yourself when you are angry<br/>
They will not become the property of another.</p>

<p>Any person who is acquainted with me knows<br/>
that I have control over myself. I do not speak in anger to<br/>
my wives children or the people. I make all my passions be<br/>
in subjection to the priesthood and the Spirit of God</p>

<p>People cannot fulfil their calling and<br/>
do their duty unless they are filled with the Holy Ghost. I do<br/>
not know that there is a female in Israel worthy of the appellation<br/>
of a Mother in Israel. For any women to raise up children<br/>
unto the Lord as they should do <strike>they should do</strike> they should<br/>
be filled with the Holy Ghost when they conceive and continue filled<br/>
with the Holy Ghost until the child is born and weaned and then<br/>
the mother should have the Holy Ghost to teach the child until<br/>
he is grown up.</p>

<p>So the father should be filled with the Holy<br/>
Ghost when he begets a child and he also should be filled<br/>
with the Holy Ghost in order to train up that child right</p>",

Kimball]] came in and soon after President [[Brigham Young|Young]] whose coming<br/>
created quite a sensation among the people for it was the first<br/>
time he had been seen in the Tabernacle since the day that<br/>
[[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] was buried. Brother Cordon soon stoped<br/>
and President Young arose and addressed the people for about<br/>
one hour and a half and he spoke in great plainness of the<br/>
things of the Kingdom of God.</p>",
42829.0,194,,""">17th</time> in company with [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] I called<br/>
upon President Young and asked him what I should do where</p>",
42829.0,195,,"<p>counsel was asked of me either by the Seventies or Bishops. [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph Young]]<br/>
said to the quorums of the Seventies that when they were called to be <br/>
Bishops or Councillors that they might still retain their place as Presidents<br/>
of the Seventies and not be ordained High Priests. Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]]<br/>
thinks they should be ordained Bishops and High Priests. What shall <br/>
I do about it?</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said that if they would go there and<br/>
hold their tongues about it they might stand as they are and act as<br/>
councillors to a Bishop; but if they will not, ordain them.</p>

<p>I said I thought men ought to walk in the channel<br/>
pointed out for them and not complain about it. President Young<br/>
said, ""Yes; let them do as they are told.""</p>

<p>I attended the Bishops' meeting in the evening<br/>
Bishop Hunter spoke and I followed him</p>

<p>I told the Bishops to impress upon the minds of the<br/>
people the necessity of living their religion after this date for if the<br/>
people again commit sin after being forgiven as they now were<br/>
they would not again be forgiven but the justice of the law<br/>
would be brought against them and they would have to pay the<br/>
penelty or be cut off from the Church</p>

<p>Again I told them they should not boast of their<br/>
authority and power or that a Seventy was greater than a High<br/>
Priest or a High Priest greater than a Seventy. No man should<br/>
boast of the power of the priesthood until he obtained some of that<br/>
power and it was manifested upon him and when that was <br/>
upon him he certainly would not boast of it, for the Holy<br/>
Spirit would teach him sense enough to know better.</p>

<p>It is very seldom that I have known the power<br/>
of the Priesthood made manifest upon the children of men in<br/>
our day to a very great degree; but in some instances it<br/>
was as in the case of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] at the time he<br/>
was full of the sick and dying at his door-yard and they</p>",
42829.0,196,,"<p>were strewed along the bank of the river for two miles and<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] rose up and shook himself like an old lion and commenced<br/>
at his tent door and healed all the people who were not dead,<br/>
on both sides of the river, by the power of God and his voice<br/>
was as the voice of God and the earth almost trembled under his<br/>
feet as he went along commanding the sick to ar<strike>r</strike>ise and be made<br/>
whole.</p>

<p>It was also manifest with Joseph while in prison and <br/>
in chains in [[Missouri|Missouri]] and his ungodly wicked persecutors<br/>
gathered around him and while he was fast in chains with<br/>
his brethren yet they goaded his feelings by boasting of how<br/>
many murders they had committed and rapes upon Mormon<br/>
wom<strike>a</strike>en and how they had cut the Mormons to pieces and<br/>
then they would blaspheme the name of God until his spirit<br/>
was reined up and he rose up in the power of God in the midst<br/>
of his chains and spoke as in a voice of thunder:</p>

<p>""Silence ye fiends of the pit! I will<br/>
not live another moment and hear such vile language from<br/>
mortals. Either you <strike>are</strike> ^or^ I shall die right here or else you<br/>
shall cease from boasting of such damnable deeds as you<br/>
are guilty of.</p>

<p>They quailed before <strike>him</strike> ^his words^ like leather wilting<br/>
in the flames and they bowed before him and made acknowledgments<br/>
to him. This was done by the power of God.</p>

<p>Again [[David Wyman Patten|David Patten]] was taken by an<br/>
armed mob under a United States warr<strike>e</strike>ant and when he<br/>
was surrounded by this armed mob of about 40 men under<br/>
the garb of law and who would not let him say a word in<br/>
his own defence he arose in the power of God and held them<br/>
fast to their seats until he had addressed them about half<br/>
an hour. He told them they were cowards rascals and<br/>
villains and he proved it to them and they had not power</p>",
42829.0,197,,""">March the 1st 1857</time></p>

<p>I was fifty years old on this birthday. I had been preserved</p>",
42829.0,198,,""">Sunday the 8th</time> of March President Young preached one<br/>
of the most comforting and interesting discourses ever delivered to the<br/>
people. He said if we pass our inspection before [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
we probably should [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] and Jesus. That we should be quite<br/>
safe. If all this people did not go to a celestial kingdom<br/>
it would be their own fault; but will all have the same exaltation<br/>
and glory in the celestial kingdom? By no means. There<br/>
will be but few who go there who will be crowned kings and<br/>
priests and Gods. There will be many millions in the<br/>
celestial kingdom who will not be exalted to those higher<br/>
blessings. This people are a good ^people^ and they are advancing<br/>
faster than any other <strike>people</strike> who ever lived. It would not<br/>
be 120 years instead of 365 before th<strike>is</strike>^ey^ <strike>people</strike> would with the<br/>
portion of earth they occupy be seperated from the whole of the wicked<br/>
The Lord will bless this people and if you will do as well as you<br/>
know how all will be well with you.</p>

<p>President Young made many glorious remarks.<br/>
At the Prayer Circle in the evening the President had [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt's]]<br/>
pamplet entitled the Holy Spirit read; and upon it President Young<br/>
said that Brother Pratt had got beyond the stars. He had<br/>
correlled them and got beyond them.</p>

<p>The President asked [[William Wines Phelps|Wm W. Phelps]] by what</p>",
42829.0,199,,"<p>authority he had proclaimed in public that he, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], was the man<br/>
that the Lord said he would raise up like unto [[Moses (OT)|Moses]].</p>

<p>[[William Wines Phelps|Phelps]] said ""[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] is gone and you are left to lead<br/>
the people.</p>

<p>Brigham Young: ""That is no argument at all. I might die and<br/>
and others be left. That does not prove that I or they would be the one<br/>
referred to. If I thought I was the man I would not tell of it. But I <br/>
think I am the great man that none of the Prophets ever thought of or<br/>
spoke of.</p>

<p>[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] said that a man in [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]] professed to<br/>
have a visit from a departed spirit. He comes to him dressed<br/>
in his temple robes and the man he comes to has not had his<br/>
endowments. I want to know what you think of it. I thought<br/>
the whole of it smelt strongly of brimstone</p>

<p>President Young answered, ""Now if the<br/>
people in Provo can be made to beleive that that is a true visit<br/>
about the third time he comes he will say that this Church is<br/>
not led by the man who ought to lead the Church. ^but the man who has this visit will tell you that he is to lead the Church^ Now I<br/>
will tell you how you may know it is a false. A spirit<br/>
will not come to a man in the flesh without he appears in his<br/>
glory and man cannot endure his glory; a resurrected body<br/>
may come and hide his glory; but that visitation is false.<br/>
It is not true""</p>

<p>On the following Sunday President Young<br/>
said to Elder Orson Hyde at the Prayer Circle, ""You have been<br/>
to both [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and [[Zion|Zion]] and seen both. I have not seen<br/>
either for I never have been in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]. Now it<br/>
is a plesant thing to think of to know where the o<strike>d</strike>ld Garden of <br/>
Eden is. Did you ever think of it or sense it. I do<br/>
not think many do. Now Jackson County is the Garden<br/>
of Eden. Joseph has declared this and I am as much bound<br/>
to believe it as much as I am to beleive that Joseph is a Prophet</p>",
42829.0,200,,""">17th</time> I made the following<br/>
remarks:</p>

<p>There is another subject which I wish to speak of. Brother<br/>
[[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] said that he wanted the clerk to keep a record of their<br/>
meetings as it would make a good history. This is a subject I<br/>
have always felt interested in and as there are many branches in<br/>
the Kingdom of God so there should be some person engaged in each<br/>
branch.</p>

<p>I have spoken upon the subject of Journal writing<br/>
and keeping a history of what transpires within us from day to day<br/>
I was deeply impressed with the importance of reading the history of the<br/>
organization of the quorum of the Twelve and the remarks of the Prophet<br/>
Joseph upon the subject: he said,</p>

<p>""I have for myself learned a fact by experience<br/>
which on reflection gives me much sorrow. It is a truth that if<br/>
I now had in my possession every decission which has been given<br/>
upon important items of doctrine and duties since the rise of this<br/>
Church they would be of incalculable worth to the Saints; but<br/>
we have neglected to keep a record of such things thinking perhaps<br/>
that they never would benefit us afterwards which had we now<br/>
would decide any point that might be agitated; and now we<br/>
cannot bear record unto the Church ^nor unto the world^ of the great and glorious manifestations<br/>
that have been made to us with that degree of power and authority<br/>
which we otherwise could if we had those decissions to publish<br/>
abroad.</p>",
42829.0,101,,"<p>through his posterity forever wherever the kingdom of God existed. Then<br/>
let every child for the future be begotten in holiness and remember<br/>
this one thing—live your religion</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] now want to speak of another thing. A small<br/>
portion of our time was spent in the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] where we <br/>
began to administer the ordinances according to the words of ##Malachi 4:5-6|[[Malachi (OT)|Malachi]]<br/>
in the 4 chapter 5th and 6th verses##—""Behold I will send you [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]]<br/>
the Prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the <br/>
Lord; and he shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children<br/>
and the hearts of the children to the Fathers lest I come and smite<br/>
the earth with with a curse""</p>

<p>[[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] received a promise from the Lord<br/>
that his seed should be saved and all the seed of Abraham<br/>
among the Gentile nations or among the uncontaminated of <br/>
the house of Israel will be gathered. They have sinned<br/>
they have changed the ordinances and broken their covenants <br/>
or you would not see the children of these mountains in<br/>
the degredation in which we now find them</p>

<p>The Lamanites upon this continent are<br/>
Manassahites almost excluseively. There is but little of <br/>
the seed of [[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]] among them. They are accounted <br/>
as the<strike>e</strike> Seed of Abraham ^and they must be saved^ or they would not have become<br/>
so loathsome as they are. They are punished in the <br/>
flesh to make an atonement in the flesh for their sins<br/>
and transgressions and when they pass through the veil the <br/>
enemy will leave no power over them</p>

<p>In the day of the Lord Jesus Christ all<br/>
the particles of the blood of Abraham will be gathered together <br/>
The seed of Abraham has not been counted for many years<br/>
and never will be again. If an angel was to commence now to<br/>
number them all, <span class=""unclear"">[<strike>illegible</strike>]</span>when <span class=""unclear"">[<strike>illegible</strike>]</span>he had got the numbers together, before<br/>
they could be computed there would be a great number more</p>",
42829.0,102,,"<p>born during the time of their numeration so they could not be<br/>
numbered and this is the reason why his seed cannot be numbered</p>

<p>Brethren and Sisters you are of the<br/>
seed of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] and you should live your religion that you may<br/>
claim the promises of Abraham</p>

<p>This Priesthood will turn the hearts of<br/>
the children to the Ancient Fathers and the Fathers to the children<br/>
now, and those which are to come will be made perfect. This<br/>
chain must not be broken for mankind cannot be saved<br/>
any other way. The Priesthood must be linked together<br/>
so that all the children may be linked to Father [[Adam (OT)|Adam]]</p>

<p>It may be asked ""When will this<br/>
work be done? It will be done in temples in our day<br/>
and in the days of our children. We shall go into the<br/>
Temples and be pillars therein and go no more out; and we shall<br/>
plant trees and vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. [[Brigham Young|I]] wall call<br/>
it the Millennium. I carry it in my heart. I say it has<br/>
begun. Every Saint carries <strike>carries</strike> it with him</p>

<p>Then let us increase in every good thing<br/>
and we shall extend this influence from Zion until it roots<br/>
out every evil and brings all in subjection to the Kingdom<br/>
of our God.</p>

<p>We will administer in the [[Salt Lake City Temple, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]] which we<br/>
have now begun and that is one point gained and we will<br/>
seal man to man by the keys of the Holy Priesthood. This<br/>
is the highest ordinance. It is the last ordinance of the<br/>
Kingdom of God on the earth and above all the endowments that<br/>
can be given you. It is a final sealing—an eternal principle<br/>
and when once made cannot be broken by the Devil</p>

<p>When we return to Zion and build<br/>
the great Temple which [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] Saw, and the centre of<br/>
Zion is established the glory of God will rest upon it by</p>",
42829.0,201,,"<p>Since the Twelve are now chosen I wish to tell them a course<br/>
which they may pursue and be benefited hereafter in point of light of which <br/>
they perhaps are not aware</p>

<p>At all times when you assemble in the capacity of a Council <br/>
to transact buisness let the oldest of your number preside and let one or <br/>
more be appointed to keep a record of your proceedings and on the <br/>
decission of every important item let it be what it may let <strike>us</strike> ^such^ decission <br/>
be noted down and they will ever afterwards remain upon record as law<br/>
covenant and doc<strike>r</strike>trine. Questions thus decided might at the time <br/>
appear unimportant, but should they be recorded and one of you lay <br/>
hands upon them afterwards you might find them of infinite worth <br/>
not only to your brethren but a feast also to your own souls</p>

<p>Should you assemble from time to time and procede<br/>
to disclose important subjects or questions and pass descisions upon <br/>
them and omit to record such decisions by and by you will be <br/>
driven to straits from which you will not be able to estricate <br/>
yourselves not being in a <strike>position</strike> situation to bring your faith to <br/>
bear with sufficient perfection or power to obtain the desired <br/>
information.</p>

<p>Now in consequence <strike>to write</strike> of a neglect to write these<br/>
things when God revealed them not esteeming them of sufficient worth <br/>
the Spirit may withdraw and God may be angry. And here <br/>
is a fountain of intelligence or knowledge of infinite importance <br/>
which is lost. What was the cause of this? The answer is <br/>
slothfulness or neglect to appoint a man to occupy a few moments <br/>
in writing.</p>

<p>Here let me prophesy the time will come when if you<br/>
neglect to do this you will fall by the hands of unrighteous men. Were <br/>
you to be brought before the authorities and accused of any crime <br/>
or misdemienor and be as innocent as the angels of God unless <br/>
you can prove that you were somewhere else your enemies will<br/>
prevail against you; but if you can bring twelve men to testify</p>",
42829.0,103,,"<p>day and by night and those who are prepared will see the face of the Son<br/>
of Man and they will see [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] in the flesh in their<br/>
resurrected bodies. Then will the armies of Israel be terrible to all<br/>
nations; then will ^one^ chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight</p>

<p>Who will resurrect Joseph's body? It will<br/>
be [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] [[James (NT)|James]] [[John (NT)|John]] [[Moroni (BoM)|Moroni]] or some one who has or who will receive<br/>
the keys of the resurrection. It will probably be one of those<br/>
who holds the keys of this dispensation and has delivered them to<br/>
Joseph. And you will see Jesus and he will eat peaches and<br/>
apples with you but the world will not see it or know it for<br/>
wickedness will increase. Joseph and Jesus will be there. They<br/>
will walk and talk with them at times and no man mistrust who<br/>
they are.</p>

<p>Joseph will lead the armies of Israel whether he is<br/>
seen or not, whether visible or invisible as seemeth him good. Joseph <br/>
has got to receive the keys of the resurrection for you and I.<br/>
After he is resurrected he will go and resurrect brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>
Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] and brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Carlos]], and when that is done he will say<br/>
now go brother Brigham and resurrect your wives and children<br/>
and gather them together. While this is done the wicked will<br/>
know nothing of it though they will be in our midst and they<br/>
will be struck with fear. This is the way the resurrection<br/>
will be. All will not be raised at once; but it will<br/>
continue in this way until all the righteous are resurrected</p>

<p>After Joseph comes to us in his resurrected<br/>
body he will more fully instruct us concerning the baptism<br/>
for the dead and sealing ordinances. He will say be<br/>
baptized for this man and that man; and that man be sealed to that<br/>
man and such a man to such a man and connect the Priesthood<br/>
together.</p>

<p>I tell you there will not be much of this done<br/>
until Joseph comes. <u>He is our</u> <u>Spiritual</u> <u>Father</u>: our hearts</p>",
42829.0,104,,"<p>are already turned to him and his to us</p>

<p>This is the order of the Holy Priesthood<br/>
and we shall continue to administer in the ordinances of the<br/>
kingdom of God here on earth. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] will not officiate in<br/>
this low capacity any more: neither did Jesus, <strike>A</strike>^a^fter his<br/>
resurrection. If so he would have baptized [[Paul (NT)|Saul]]; but<br/>
he was exalted above the earth and he told Saul to go to<br/>
a certain man in a certain street and he would administer to<br/>
him the ordinances upon the earth</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] say to you dont hurry in the<br/>
ordinances. Dont do what you ought not. It is not<br/>
the time to hurry. We should not undertake to do now<br/>
what we ought to do fifty years hence. What have we<br/>
to do to day^?^ Purify your hearts that you may<br/>
receive the manifestation of the Spirit of God</p>

<p>When you sow your wheat you<br/>
prepare the ground and then sow your wheat and watch<br/>
it till the harvest. It is just so in the Priesthood<br/>
You will be just as busy as you can be to do the things<br/>
which are to be done to day</p>

<p>Now dont be in a hurry. I say<br/>
we are going to have time enough. I say I will be here<br/>
on earth to do all I can; and after I die and get my body<br/>
again (my resurrected body) I mean to come back to the earth<br/>
again and fight the devils and be here at the winding-up<br/>
scene. I want to see righteousness prevail and the<br/>
Saints have peace on the earth.</p>

<p>I wish now to speak upon another<br/>
subject. I am here as the Governor of this [[Utah Territory|Territory]]<br/>
and I wish to comm<strike>e</strike>^e^n<strike>d</strike>^ce^ my remarks upon this subject with <br/>
the [[Franklin Pierce|President]] of the United States. Is he the Master<br/>
of the United States? No he is not. He is selected</p>",
42829.0,202,,"<p>that you were in some other place at that time you will escape their hands <br/>
Now if you will be careful to keep minutes of these things as I have said it will <br/>
be one of the most important and interesting records ever seen. I have now <br/>
laid these ^things before your^ consideration and you are left to act according to your own <br/>
judgement."" (See Record of the Twelve and History of the Church Feb<br/>
1835; Historians Office)</p>

<p>I have thus refer<strike>ed</strike>red to some of the words of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
to the Twelve Apostles at their organization. This shows the feelings <br/>
of the Prophet Joseph upon the subject.</p>

<p>I have had this same subject upon my mind ever since<br/>
I have been a member of the Church. <strike>I have been inspired and moved<br/>
upon my mind ever since I have been in the Church.</strike> I have been <br/>
inspired and moved upon to keep a Journal and write the affairs of this <br/>
Church as far as I can. I did not understand why my feelings were <br/>
exercised so much in the early age of this Church; but I understand <br/>
it now.</p>

<p>I seldom ever heard Brother Joseph or the Twelve preach or teach <br/>
any principle but what I felt as uneasy as a fish out of water until I <br/>
had written it. Then I felt right. I could write a sermon <br/>
of Joseph's a week after it was delivered and almost word for word <br/>
and after it was written it was taken from me or from my mind <br/>
This was a gift from God unto me and I have kept a Journal of almost <br/>
every day of my life for the last 24 years. I could tell each <br/>
day what I had done what company I was in and what was transpiring <br/>
around me and any teachings or counsels from the Presidency of the <br/>
Church except where I knew the reporters had written their discourses <br/>
I have urged the same course upon the Twelve and all the quorums <br/>
of the Church to keep a record of their meetings and the dealings of God <br/>
with them and for all men who hear the Priesthood to keep a <br/>
record of their lives especially of all their official acts in the Church <br/>
and the Kingdom of God</p>

<p>You may say that this is a great deal of </p>",
42829.0,105,,"<p>to sit there as one of our servants to act for us and to do what we wish<br/>
to have done. So it is with the Congress and the Governors of the<br/>
several States and [[Brigham Young|I]] am here as one of them as the Servant of the<br/>
people</p>

<p>Congress has p^repared^ a Constitution for this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] which<br/>
they call the organic act and have granted certain rights to this people<br/>
as a community. They have said this Territory should be<br/>
organized thus and so with a Governor and Legislative Assembly<br/>
and the right is given to the people to elect twenty six Representatives<br/>
and thirteen councillors ann[u]ally. This body may enact laws<br/>
to control each of us and all the inhabitants of this Territory<br/>
including the Governor the Judges the Secretary the Supreme<br/>
Court the District Court and the Probate Court. They have said<br/>
they shall have all the power given to them by the Legislative<br/>
Assembly.</p>

<p>We have a Legi<strike>la</strike>slative Assembly and Majestrates<br/>
courts. Congress will send certain men to hold Supreme<br/>
Courts and send other men as officers to the Territory of Utah<br/>
to transact business for the Territory of Utah so as to make it as<br/>
easy as possible.</p>

<p>The United States Judges are not here as Kings<br/>
or Monarchs but as servants of the people and when you see a<br/>
Judge putting a city under ""martial law"" he manifests boyism<br/>
and you should pity him and give him a piece of cake</p>

<p>If a man wants to be what he is not it is<br/>
certain that he wants to get out of his sphere. When some<br/>
men know a hundred words they think they know all of Webster<br/>
Some will try to study a hundred sciences of the day and<br/>
then know no more than a child. When a man studies<br/>
Divinity five years he is only fit to be put down upon<br/>
the ground as a block to stand upon to get upon your<br/>
horses. </p>",
42829.0,106,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] see some here who have come fifty or<br/>
one hundred miles at the squaling of a goose crow and dont you<br/>
know that if you want a court held there that the Judges should <br/>
go there and hold it? <strike>a</strike>And if a Judge dont know that it is because<br/>
he is very ignorant and he ought to learn his duty</p>

<p>I am perfectly astonished at these, my <br/>
brethren, to think that if a man takes a pumpkin and says<br/>
it is an apple you must acknowledge it is an apple and<br/>
swallow it as such or if they take a rotton potatoe and say it<br/>
is a peach and cram it down your throat as a peach. When<br/>
you see a rotton potatoe why dont you acknowledge it to be a<br/>
rotton potatoe</p>

<p>Now I say to you jurimen and witnesses<br/>
pack up your deeds and go home and stay there till you have<br/>
business. If I come here and act the tyrant instead of<br/>
a Governor you ought to kick me out and all officers ought<br/>
to be served in the same way when they get out of their<br/>
place and act the fool or else let the people swallow the<br/>
rotton potatoe and call it a peach</p>

<p>I know the meaning the marrow<br/>
and the pith of the laws and the very principle upon which<br/>
they are built much better than the Judges do. I know<br/>
the meaning of them and the duty of all the officers in this<br/>
[[Utah Territory|Territory]]. I say this for your instruction</p>

<p>To see men come here at the call<br/>
of a foolish boy fre[e]zing your toes and killing your horses<br/>
in the cold month of December is foolishness. When you <br/>
want him send for him and pay your respects to him.</p>

<p>They do not understand the law. When<br/>
I see Lawyers and Judges rise up here and saying that our laws<br/>
are not right and we should not be governed by them<br/>
it puts me in mind it puts me in mind of the anecdote</p>",
42829.0,203,,"<p>trouble. Very well. It has been so to me in one sense. It has occupied <br/>
nearly every leasure moment of my time for 14 years. But what of it? <br/>
I have never spent any of my time more profitably for the benefit of mankind <br/>
than in my Journal writing for a great portion of the Church History has <br/>
been compiled from my Journals and some of the most Glorious Gospel <br/>
sermons truths and revelations that were given from God <strike>through</strike> to this people <br/>
through the mouths of the Prophets [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] and the Twelve <br/>
could not be found upon the earth on record only in my Journals <br/>
and they are compilled in the Church History and transmitted to the <br/>

my trouble? It does.</p>

<p>In many instances in this Church men have been <br/>
appointed Clerks to write for the Church and they have kept the records <br/>
instead of delivering them to the President of the Church to whom they <br/>
belonged and soon they would apostatize and then they would insult <br/>
the Church by offering to sell them their own records at an enormous <br/>
price.</p>

<p>I have deposited my records and Journals in the [[Historian|Historians <br/>
Office]] where I hope they may do some good</p>

<p>We have had a very interesting time this Winter during <br/>
the Reformation among the Latter-day Saints. The spirit and <br/>
power of God have been poured out in a wonderful manner and <br/>
many glorious truths have been revealed through the Presidency <br/>
Twelves and others and in various quorums meetings. Now should <br/>
not there be a record kept of those things? In the commencement <br/>
of these meetings the clerks took quite full reports but thinking <br/>
it too much trouble they now t<strike>h</strike>ake them very short and we can <br/>
hardly get an outline of the real facts of our meetings and the <br/>
power of God and the dealings of God with us</p>

<p>According to the adjournment at [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|Filmore]] a mass meeting<br/>
of the people conveined in the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] for the purpose of<br/>
taking into consideration the propriety of establishing<br/>
a daily express and passenger communication ^between^ the Western<br/>
States and [[California|California]]. The meeting was organized</p>",
42829.0,251,,"<p>and [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C Rich]] return to the seat of war and take charge of the command</p>

<p>The following is a sypnosis of a conversation of President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]]. He said:</p>

<p>""If any officers come to the army—the [[Alfred Cumming|Governor]] or Judges and<br/>
send word that they want to come in just inform them that they are as near<br/>
as they can come. Had they have come without a military array they<br/>
could have come and not have been molested but now they cannot come<br/>
We will not have any cursed scoundrel forced upon us to judge or rule<br/>
over us and they shall not come among us</p>

<p>If [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] comes with troops and intends to come<br/>
in I expect they will leave their baggage battary and a company to guard<br/>
it and come in on a forced march without it. Then we must not let<br/>
them sleep but use them ^up^ us as soon as we can. Work night and day<br/>
and not let them sleep.</p>

<p>Brother [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] thinks they are determined<br/>
to come in. I have sent word that if General [[William S. Harney|Harvey]] is on his<br/>
way to get into camp and kill him if possible and take the the animals<br/>
from Johnson if possible and take charge of the goods train. President<br/>
Young said I am glad of one thing; ie, this thing will be just as<br/>
the Lord wants it. If he wants them to come and get killed<br/>
it will be so. If he wants them to go North South or East he<br/>
will have it just as he wants and this I am thankful for and I feel<br/>
perfectly easy about it all.</p>

<p>You will find that when the Lord sees that we<br/>
are willing to fight and get just ready to shoot that he will fight our<br/>
battles. He said [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] may stop in the city this<br/>
time. Let Charles C Rich go. He is a good General and a wise<br/>
man in calculation. I reckon a good deal upon him in the<br/>
future.</p>

<p>On the next day the 29 General D. H. Wells with his<br/>
companions left the city to take command of the Expedition in<br/>
the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|mountains]] and the company of cavalry commanded by [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
Kimbal]]l also went out.</p>",
42829.0,204,,"<p>He should give a brief sketch of all his missions and of all his official <br/>
acts and the dealings of God with him. Then if he was to die and <br/>
the historians wished to publish his history they would have something <br/>
to go by.</p>

<p>Many think that this is a dry subject and unimportant <br/>
but it is not so to me. I am now trying to get up a history of <br/>
the Twelve Apostles as first organized. Half of them are now <br/>
out of the Church and scarcely any record left whereby I can get <br/>
a correct knowledge of their history in the ministry of this work <br/>
and some of those who remain and are laboring to build up the<br/>
Kingdom of God have not kept a record of their missions ministry <br/>
official acts and decissions upon important subjects and the gifts <br/>
graces and dealings of God with them sufficient to give a true and <br/>
correct history of their lives</p>

<p>There are but a few aside form the Presidency <br/>
of the Church who feel the importance of this subject sufficient to <br/>
put it into practice. The majority think the matter not <br/>
important; but I believe it is otherwise.</p>

<p>The Prophets would not have been moved <br/>
upon to exhort us to faithfulness upon this subject had it not been <br/>
important. The Lord has told us that what we seal on earth <br/>
shall be sealed in heaven and what we record on earth shall be <br/>
recorded in heaven and what is not sealed or recorded on earth <br/>
is not sealed or recorded in heaven. Therefore it appears to be <br/>
very important that we do keep a true and faithful record in all <br/>
things.</p>

<p>While walking in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in <br/>
the same water neither can we spend twice the same time. When <br/>
we pass out of that door the work of this meeting will be closed <br/>
to us forever. We shall never ^again^ spend the time of this evening <br/>
Then should we not keep a record of our work teachings and <br/>
counsels which we give in this meeting? We should.</p>",
42829.0,109,,""">9th</time> I spent mostly up till 10<br/>
o'clock at night in President Young's Office in company with<strike>e</strike><br/>
Brothers Watt and [[Samuel Whitney Richards|Samuel Richards]] in making the manuscript<br/>
for the First Reader to be published in the Deseret Alphabet<br/>
I spent some time in scearching other books for matter but my<br/>
mind was led<strike>d</strike> to choose finally our own experience travels incidents<br/>
history doctrines and our location and we commenced to write<br/>
upon these subjects.</p>

<p>Sunday followed and on the Monday we<br/>
resumed our work upon this matter of the Reader and the<br/>
Deseret Alphabet. In the evening the committee met with<br/>
the Regency at the President's upper room and the work of the<br/>
committee was read and accepted. Another Committee</p>",
42829.0,110,,""">Sunday the 17th</time> President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] asked [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] what he thought of his preaching that<br/>
intelligent beings would continue to learn to all eternity.</p>

<p>Orson Pratt replied that he believed the Gods had<br/>
a knowledge at the present time of everything that did or will exist to<br/>
the endless ages of all eternity. He believed it as much as any truth<br/>
he had ever learned in or out of the Church</p>

<p>President Young remarked that he had never learned<br/>
that principle in the Church; for it was not true: it was false<br/>
doctrine; for the Gods and all intelligent beings would never cease<br/>
to learn except it were the Sons of Perdition: they would continue<br/>
to decrease until they became dissolved back into their native<br/>
element and lose their identity</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P.<br/>
Pratt]] preached a good discourse in the 14th Ward. He told the<br/>
[[Abraham Lucas Hoagland|Bishop]] to cut off all the liars thieves adulterers and profane swearers<br/>
from the Church for they would rot the body if they continued<br/>
on it. He said many wicked men would stick by the<br/>
Church but they would never repent of their sins. There was<br/>
a time when man could repent but when that time was past<br/>
men might pray till their knees where [were] callaced and they could<br/>
not get the Spirit of God. How long did the people who<br/>
were destroyed in the flood have to wait before they could<br/>
have the offer of the S<strike>r</strike>pirit of God or the Gospel? They<br/>
had to wait more than two thousand years, till after Christ<br/>
came and was crucified. He then went and preached to the<br/>
""Spirits in Prison."" The Gospel was then offered unto them.<br/>
And how has it been with the Jews. They once saw the<br/>
day when the Gospel was offered unto them but when<br/>
they put to death their King and Saviour the Gospel</p>",
42829.0,205,,"<p>Again Elders go forth upon missions to the nations of the earth <br/>
They have to enter into a regular warefare. The Lord pours out his Holy Spirit <br/>
upon them and they war with the world the flesh and the devil, with <br/>
kings princes lords presidents and rulers. They are cast into prison <br/>
and the Lord delivers them. The devil enters into some of their <br/>
converts and the lay hands upon them and cast them out. The <br/>
Saints are sick and they heal them. They prophesy in the name <br/>
of the Lord and their words come to pass. Rulers declair that <br/>
they shall not preach to the people on pain of death. They preach<br/>
the word of God and many believe obey and rejoice in the Lord <br/>
and they are protected by the power of God. They go<strike>es</strike> upon <br/>
the sea and the storms rage and they calm<strike>s</strike> the<strike>m</strike> water and <br/>
wind in the name of the Lord. They are shielded and <br/>
goverened by the angels of God all the day long and they know <br/>
the power of God is with them revealing unto them the evils<br/>
that lie in their path.</p>

<p>And yet the Elders do not view these great and <br/>
important things of value enough to make a record of them to <br/>
spend a short time in writing them; and the circumstance<br/>
and history of these blessings unto them are lost both to the present <br/>
and the future generations. Are these things right? I do <br/>
not believe they are. I do not believe men are justified in <br/>
neglecting to record these things</p>

<p>Now as an example: Should the ten lost <br/>
tribes of Israel suddenly come pouring down upon us in the land <br/>
of Zion led by the Holy Prophets of God what would be one of <br/>
the first enquiries we should make of them? It would be where <br/>
are your records and History and the revelations and dealings <br/>
of God with you since you were led away under [[Shalmaneser (OT)|Shalmaezer]] <br/>
king of [[Assyria|Asyria]]? O do let me see and read them and do <br/>
let me have the journal of your travels from the North country <br/>
to our land of Zion </p>",
42829.0,252,,"<p>On the 3rd of Nov. an express arrived and brought<br/>
a letter from Col. [[Edmund Brooke Alexander|Alexander]] thanking Governor [[Brigham Young|Young]]  for sending him<br/>
his prisoners and saying that he should send back those he held only<br/>
he had a civil process against them. Probably his intention was to<br/>
hang them for treason.</p>

Related by President Young<br/>
Nov 8th</p>

<p>In our prayer circle on this Sunday President Young related the<br/>
circumstance of the brethren seeing a circle of about 40 persons dressed<br/>
in white robes and caps in the upper room of the Temple Kirtland<br/>
during the Spring 1835 after the endowments. There was<br/>
no person in the room at the time who was mortal yet the room<br/>
was filled with light and many personages appeared clothed in white<br/>
and frequently went to the windows and looked out so that the brethren<br/>
in the streets could see them plainly. Brother Young and [[Truman Osborn Angell|Truman<br/>
O Angel]] stood together in the street and looked at them. [[William Wines Phelps|W. W.<br/>
Phelps]] says he saw them for 3 hours. They were visible by all<br/>
the brethren present. Brother Angel said they must have stood<br/>
some two feet from the floor as they were only the size of common<br/>
men. They could not have been seen from the place where<br/>
they stood except it had been the head and those personages<br/>
appeared nearly down to the waist as they looked out of window<br/>
with a front view.</p>

said Amen. He called [[Zerubbabel Snow|Zerubable Snow]] by name and he</p>",
42829.0,206,,"<p>And what would be our disapointment should their Prophets and Elders <br/>
say, O we have not got any history of the dealings of God with us nor <br/>
any journal of our travels. We used to hear our fathers say that <br/>
there had been greta and mighty things done in the land where we <br/>
lived. The Saviour came and taught great and marvellous things<br/>
and we had a glorious time in coming here. We smote the rocks and <br/>
the mighty mountains of ice fell down with a great noise and great <br/>
miracles were wrought but our fathers had so much to do and we have <br/>
had so much to do that we never had any time to write anything <br/>
about it and we did not think that any body would have any interest in <br/>
it but ourselves, and so we did not write</p>

<p>Should we not be greatly disappointed? <br/>
We should; and so with them if they should ask us for our records <br/>
and say that Jesus and the angels told us that you were building <br/>
up Zion and doing a great work in the earth and that great and <br/>
glorious things were revealed unto you and we now wish to read those <br/>
things. <strike>an</strike> And should we tell them that we had done as they had <br/>
not kept a record of any of these things, they would be like ourselves <br/>
much disappointed. but if they and ourselves should both keep <br/>
a strict account of all that is useful then it would add great joy <br/>
to both tha<strike>t</strike>y and us. Then let us lay these things to heart and <br/>
keep a true and faithful record that we may be justified <br/>
before God.</p>

the enemy.</p>

<p>Col. [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] said to Maj. Allen, of our Expedition, whom they<br/>
had taken prisoner ""God damn you when I get to [[Fort Bridger, Green River County, Utah Territory|Bridger]] I will hang you.""</p>

<p>So Maj. Allen thinking there was not much chance<br/>
for his life and prefering shooting to hanging during the same evening,<br/>
though closly guarded by 24 men, pulled off his boots and walked up to<br/>

made a spring and cleared himself of the guard.</p>

<p>He ran into the midst of a herd of cattle so they could not shoot<br/>
him. Horsemen immediately started in persuit but in the darkness<br/>
of the night they could not overtake him. He ran in his stocking<br/>
feet in the snow for 30 miles carrying his boots in his hand not daring<br/>
to stop to put them on and arrived in our camp in safety.</p>

remarks concerning sending missionaries abroad and said he would send <br/>
many to the States if he could get those of the right stripe. He said there <br/>
was a great difference in men preaching and spoke of brother [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Clapp]] in <br/>
[[Texas|Texas]] and the Twelve in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]].</p>

<p>The statistical account at the financial affairs of the <br/>
Church was read.</p>

economy</p>

a good time. The conference this day was addressed by Brigham Young <br/>
Heber C Kimball Daniel H Wells Orson Hyde Wilford Woodruff Lorenzo Snow <br/>
and F. D. Richards and others</p>

<p>Among other things President Young said that babes and <br/>
children gazed upon angels a great deal and they ^were^ innocent before God and <br/>
when they were brought up properly they would always be holy men and women <br/>
before the Lord.</p>

<p>The President also exhorted the people to se<strike>n</strike>t out fruit trees <br/>

<p>They stoped a short time in front of the Governor's<br/>
Office and then continued their march towards the mountains of snow as<br/>
nearly 2000 of their brethren had done before. Many went with<br/>
wet feet poor boots and straw hats on and without tents or fire for that<br/>
night as they could not reach timber until the next day. This showed<br/>
the willingness of the Saints to maintain the Kingdom of God and<br/>
defend themselves against our enemies.</p>

<p>On the 26th [[Ben Simons|Ben Simons]] a Cherokee called<br/>
into President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] office. He had been two days in the camp<br/>
of the enemy. He said they wanted salt very much. Their cattle<br/>
were dying very fast and they were cutting timber and digging holes<br/>
in the earth which looked like going into Winter Quarters. The merchants<br/>
were suffering for want of food and they deserved it for they had been<br/>
the means in a great measure in bringing on the war.</p>

<p>Next day President Young sent</p>

Quarters for the whole army. It was still thought that they<br/>
might attempt to come in.</p>

shop being broken open and 150 lbs of flour taken from it<br/>
and that Wilford Woodruff lost 35 lbs from his buckery.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff followed and said that<br/>
those who took his flour if they took it because they were<br/>
suffering with hunger and would ask a blessing upon the bread<br/>
when it was made and send him home the bags he would<br/>
not bring an accusation against them. At the close<br/>

had their handcarts fitted up and started out. There was 25 handcarts <br/>

<p>On the 25 of May my daughter [[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe]] had <br/>
a very severe attack of inflamation on the lungs or something like the <br/>
plurisy and could not breathe only with great difficulty. We bolstered <br/>
her up in bed and she would catch for breath like a person straugling<br/>
We annointed ^her^ laid hands upon her and rebuked the desease. I finally <br/>
got [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith's]] hankerchief which he gave me in 1839 and said <br/>
it should remain as a league between us as long as I would keep it. I <br/>
laid the handkerchief and she became somewhat better and slept</p>

42829.0,115,,""">15th</time> I met with President [[Brigham Young|Young]] at his office<br/>

to him. I was getting initiated into my office as Assistant Church<br/>
Historian to take charge of the Historian's office and business in<br/>
the absence of George A. Smith</p>

<p>In reading the revelation upon Patriarchal marriage<br/>
<strike>and while</strike> upon the paragraph relating to the sheding of innocent blood<br/>
President Young remarked that it was a very nice point to distinguish<br/>
between i^n^nocent blood and that which is not innocent. Were we now<br/>
commanded to go and avenge the blood of the Prophets where it would<br/>
reach infants from the cradle to the third and fourth generation<br/>
should we know what to do in such case? We should not. But<br/>
there is one thing that is a consolation to me and that is that I am<br/>
satisfied that the Lord will not require it of this people until they<br/>
become sanctified and are led by the Spirit of God so as not to<br/>
shed innocent blood</p>

<p>Again what does the saying mean that all<br/>
shall be damned who do not keep this law unto whom it is<br/>
revealled? Does it mean that they shall take more wives than<br/>
one? I think that it includes the whole law with its<br/>
covenants. I think that many who come into this world will<br/>
be damned or disorganized and I think that this is the ^second^ death<br/>
which is referred to that ^as^ the broad road leads to ^death^ while few will<br/>

<p>A Proclamation From [[Alfred Cumming|A. Cummings]] As Governor of [[Utah Territory|Utah]].</p>

<p>We found Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[Albert Carrington|Carrington]] at the Office; and soon<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] and others came. Brother<br/>
Carrington read the Proclamation in which A Cummings called himself<br/>
Governor of Utah and said that the [[James Buchanan|President of the United States]] appointed<br/>
him Governor of Utah. He commanded all <strike>the</strike> armed people to disperse<br/>
to their homes and said all that opposed them would be treated as traitors<br/>
He also wrote a letter to Governor Young accusing him of treason and<br/>
said that he should establish his quarters in [[Green River County, Utah Territory|Green River County]] and<br/>
organize a temporary government and that all would be tried for treason<br/>
who opposed them.</p>

<p>We went to the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] and after the Preaching Brother<br/>
Carrington read the Proclamation and the letters</p>

<p>Disbanding and Return of our Troops from the Mountains</p>

<p>On the 2nd of December early in the morning<br/>
the troops began to arrive having been dismissed by General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]]<br/>
and they continued to pour into the city until a late hour of the day.<br/>
Brother [[Henry Larkin Southworth|Southworth]] who had been a prisoner related to me his capture<br/>

Livingston]] the principal merchant of [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|G. S. L. City]] he asked him to intercede<br/>
with [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnston]] to let him go <strike>as</strike> to his family as they had nothing against<br/>
him only that he was a Mormon but Livingston would do nothing<br/>
for him.</p>

<p>He reported that there was much of the spirit of desertion<br/>
in the camp and that the officers treated their soldiers in a cruel manner<br/>
and that many would desert if they could. He said that the<br/>
greatest amount of any one article in the camp was ardent spirits<br/>

the States. We found that all hell was boiling over against us. Among the <br/>
rest [[William Smith|W<u><sup>m</sup></u> Smith]] called upon the Government to furnish him with an army and <br/>
money and he would come to Utah and subdue the Mormons</p>

<p>In conversation in the [[Historian|Historian's Office]] on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of June<br/>
between President Young George A Smith [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] and myself the [[Brigham Young|President]]<br/>
said</p>

<p>There is no law in heaven or earth that would compel a woman to stay <br/>
with a man either in time or eternity. This I think is true but I do not <br/>
know. If a man who is a High Priest takes a woman and she leaves him <br/>
and goes to one of a lower office say the lesser Priesthood or members, I think <br/>
in the resurrection that that High Priest can claim her</p>

<p>Joseph Young: What if she should not want to go with him? I <br/>
should not want a woman under those circumstances</p>

<p>Brigham: I will tell you what you will find that all these<br/>
evil traditions and affections or passions that haunt the mind in this life will <br/>
all be done away in the resurrection. You will find then that any <br/>
man who gets a glory and exaltation will be so beautiful that any woman <br/>
would be willing to have him if it was right and whenever it is right <br/>
for the woman to go there she will be willing to go for all those evils <br/>
will vanish to which we are subject in this life. I have told the truth <br/>
just as it is but others <strike>will</strike> at times will get up and tell the people that <br/>
they will have no heaven only what they make in this life and that it <br/>
will be in the next world as it will be this. Now they do not mean <br/>
what they say. They do not explain themselves and hence the people <br/>
do not understand</p>

<p>Joseph Young said, ""I wish I knew what my limits are"" <br/>
and the President replied</p>

<p>""Your limits are endless and you have not go half <br/>
way to the end of it yet. Now when I was an Elder I was as </p>",

<p>I met with the Presidency and Twelve on this<br/>
Sunday in Prayer Circle. After prayers President Young<br/>
asked those who were going away on missions if they<br/>
were satisfied with him and felt satisfied that he was</p>",

the army had a great amount  of liquor as well as all the Suttlers<br/>
The officers were drunk every day.</p>

<p>He also said that there was a division of the<br/>
officers as well as the soldiers. A portion of them think that<br/>
Governor [[Brigham Young|Young]] is justified in taking the course he does in his own<br/>
defence. Their animals were dying so fast that they all<br/>
expected to be on foot before next Spring. They had sent Captain <br/>
[[Randolph Barnes Marcy|Marcy]] to [[Texas|Texas]] to buy mules horses and oxen.</p>

<p>Summary of the Season's Expedition</p>

<p>The Expedition of the Season was now entirely<br/>
closed. We had clearly seen the hand of God made visible in<br/>
our behalf. An army had been sent by the United States to<br/>
make war for the sole purpose to destroy the Church of Jesus Christ<br/>
of Latter-day Saints. The Kingdom of God had been driven<br/>
from the confines of the United States into the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]]<br/>
then [[Mexican Cession Territory|Mexican Territory]] with the hope of the nation that we should<br/>
perish but as soon as they found that we should live and prosper<br/>
they became alarmed and resolved upon our destruction and now<br/>
the United States had sent their armies out to accomplish their<br/>
hellish purpose.</p>

<p>As soon as this was known unto us the [[Brigham Young|leader]]<br/>
of the Church and Kingdom of God rose up in the strength of Israel's<br/>
God and proclaimed Israel free. His Counsellors [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]]<br/>
and [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H Well]] with the Twelve Apostles sustained him and all<br/>
the people said, Amen.</p>

<p>He testified unto the people in the name of<br/>
God that if they would be united with him in their faith prayers and<br/>
works the enemy should not have power to come into our<br/>
[[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]]; that the Lord would hedge up their way and we should</p>",

do not see it so. Now if you should be with the Twelve or anybody <br/>
you would have a right to correct an error as well as with a member but <br/>
you could not correct them by cutting them off from the Church because they <br/>
are over you in the Priesthood</p>

<p>Prophecies of [[Joseph Young|Joseph]] and [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] <br/>
upon <br/>
[[William B. Smith|William Smith]]</p>

<p>On Sunday the 14 of June in the prayer circle the subject of <br/>
William Smith was brought up. It was said that Joseph Smith <br/>
prophesied that his brother William would become a good man when<br/>
he became an old man. Some of the brethren present at our prayer <br/>
circle thought he said if he ever did become good it would be when he was<br/>
an old man.</p>

<p>President Young then said whether Joseph said it or not <br/>
I will say in the name of the Lord that if William Smith lives till he is <br/>
65 or 70 he will become a good humble man; he will do the best he can <br/>
He will have to answer for his sins. Write this brother Woodruff<br/>
and put it into the Church History. When a man gives way to the <br/>
power of the devil he finds it hard to recover himself.</p>

<p>The Female Relief Society</p>

<p>On the 17th they met at my house. There were about 50 present<br/>
sewing knitting sewing carpet rags making quilts &amp;c. It is a laudable<br/>
undertaking. All the females in the Ward met at my house <br/>
each Wednesday afternoon. They open and close with prayer Mrs <br/>
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe Wo Woodruff]] was President and Mrs [[Mary Ann Frost Pratt|Pratt]] secretary. They clothed<br/>
all the poor in the Ward and during the last quarter they made a <br/>
donation to the Perpetual Emigration Fund of 126 dollars.</p>

<p>We finished reading [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel Smith's]] ^history^ on the <br/>
16th and found in the office the histories of [[David Wyman Patten|David Patten]] Samuel</p>",
42829.0,117,,""">22nd</time> and met at the mouth of the Kanyon. I took my family<br/>
in a carriage and drove there to visit them and take minutes of their<br/>
organization. President Young arrived at half past 10 o'clock<br/>
and organized the company by appointing [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] captain<br/>
[[William Miller, b. 1814|William Miller]] captain of the guard Elder [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] Chaplain<br/>
and [[James Ure|James Ure]] clerk. He gave them some instruction<br/>
concerning their journey and also gave them his parting blessing<br/>
Brother [[John Varah Long|J. V. Long]] reported his speech and Wilford Woodruff took<br/>
a list of the names of those going East on mission and found them<br/>
to be 36 in number. Professor Orson Pratt was going to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] <br/>
to take the place of [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D. Richards]]. He was accompanied<br/>
by Elder E. T. Benson also of the Twelve Apostles and other missionaries<br/>
to England. The Hon. George A Smith was going to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]<br/>
as a delegate from our State Convention to urge in connection <br/>
with the Hon. [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] the claims of [[Utah Territory|Utah]] to be numbered<br/>

President [[Brigham Young|Young]] had taught from day to day when there was every prospect<br/>
that the enemy would try to come.</p>

<p>From 2 to 3 thousand of the brethren had armed<br/>
themselves and went into the Mountains according to the counsel of President<br/>
Young and they were led by their valiant General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]] to hedge<br/>
up the way of the enemy should they attempt to come in. Our brethren<br/>
had made large entrenchments and ditches and piled up large masses<br/>
of rocks in narrow passes so as to roll them down upon the enemy<br/>
and destroy them should they attempt to come in. But as the<br/>
Prophets Brigham and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] had said so it came to pass. The Lord<br/>
fought our battles and hedged up the way of our enemies. When<br/>
they got to [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Ham's Fork]] 150 miles from our [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city ]]the storms and cold<br/>
killed their horses mules and cattle by hundreds so that when<br/>
the whole army got together with the [[Alfred Cumming|Governor]] and Judges whom the<br/>
Government had sent to rule and tyranize over us they had<br/>
not enough teams left to draw one third of their trains so they<br/>
were oblidged to stop and spend the Winter in the storms of the<br/>
Mountains and their wisdom seems taken from them.</p>

<p>Our brethren had been enabled to head then<br/>
like a herd of cattle and they had shot grape and musket and<br/>
minnie [Minié] balls at them from time to time and those balls had<br/>
flown like hail around the servants of God but not a drop of<br/>
their blood had been shed neither had the brethren returned the fire<br/>
upon the enemy even as much as in one instance. Fear had<br/>
so taken hold upon them that they would flee into their main<br/>
body at the approach of a small number of our brethren and the<br/>
Lord had frustrated the enemy in all their designs against us up<br/>
to this day.</p>

as a Summer's day and the army of Zion was now returning to<br/>

<p>The Constitution of the Kingdom</p>

<p>The great discourse delivered by President [[Brigham Young|Young]] on Sunday the 21st he <br/>
said among many other important items, ""The Constitution of the United<br/>
States was got up by inspiration. It gives all men the rights of conscience <br/>
So it will be in the Millennium. It will be like the Constitution. All <br/>
will have to bow the knee and acknowledge the Lord that it is his right<br/>
to reign but they must not blaspheme; but they may enjoy their own religion</p>

<p>Men talk about making a law to stop Polygamy <br/>
in [[Utah|Utah]] that would be an <u>expose</u> <u>facto</u> law and the Constitution declairs <br/>
that Congress shall make no such law and if the time comes when the <br/>
United States do make a law and send men to punish me for Polygamy <br/>
or having more than one wife as there is no law against it you may <br/>
make up your mind that I shall send them to hell. I do not <br/>
think they will do it but if they do you may tell them they had <br/>
better send 100,000 men with provisions for five years and they <br/>
may make their calculations upon it they will want to make forts <br/>
from one end of the route to the other, so that they can step from one <br/>
to the other. There is a sweeping clause against this proceding. When <br/>
they charter a ship company to build ships and control them they cede <br/>
up their right in the case. So it is in the Territories. They have <br/>
a Territorial Government. This people should have the right to <br/>
govern their own institutions</p>

<p>General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] related that brother Maxwell had<br/>
command of a small scouting company. They took a horse from<br/>
the enemy and was fired at by them but no one was hurt. They<br/>
went back to their encampment. Brother Maxwell became<br/>
strongly impressed that there was danger in their way and that<br/>
they ought to leave their camp. He told his brethren this but<br/>
some of them did not think so and all went to bed. But these<br/>
feelings increased upon brother Maxwell and he arose from his<br/>
bed and told his brethren he was going to leave that place immediately<br/>
and they all gathered up their horses amd went several miles back<br/>
and camped for the night and soon the encampment which they<br/>
had just left was surrounded by a hundred men and had it not<br/>
have been for this warning they probably would have been all taken<br/>
prisoners.</p>

disease and live to enjoy the society of your family and<br/>
your children shall grow up around you and you shall<br/>
be a blessing to them. Let your heart be comforted;<br/>

there was</p>

<p>One party was the military and the other was called Freemen. There<br/>
was a fight among them and 7 men killed. <strike>Gen</strike> [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] sent<br/>
the military to quell the mob and Governor [[Alfred Cumming|Cumming]] told<br/>
them to go back that when he wanted them he would call for<br/>
them.</p>

the Eastern States</p>

<p>I had a dream. I thought I saw my family picking <br/>
all kinds of flowers and fruit. I thought I went East to preach and I <br/>
saw that the people in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] had dug down the mountain or cut it <br/>
down square and brought the soil out of the mountain and made some <br/>
good gardens. I went on East and I heard a Methodist Priest pray for <br/>
sinners. A man followed me and asked me if I wanted some <br/>
brass. I told him no. They wanted me to steal something<br/>
I told them I would not do it. It was <strike>makes</strike> ^moulds^ to make coin in <br/>
that they wanted me to steal. I saw ^stolen^ goods in great piles and stacks <br/>
that the people in the Eastern States had stolen; and some tried to <br/>
raise a mob upon me but I did not fear them. Soon I saw some <br/>
brethren. I saw one Apostate. He wanted to kill me. I told him <br/>
if he did not behave himself I would sent him to hell. I again <br/>
saw the brethren cut down the mountain and make good farms <br/>
I thought these were good times.""</p>

<p>President Young said he felt some of the time like<br/>

<p>With true respect, and as a tribute due,<br/>
To friendship, brother Woodruf unto you,<br/>
As one more blessed than most your fellow men,<br/>
I now address the effusion of my pen.</p>

The [[Brigham Young|President]] said that [[David Wyman Patten|David Patten]] and [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|T B. Marsh]] came to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]<br/>
in the fall of 1837. As soon as they came I got Marsh to go to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
but Patten would go to [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]]. He got his mind prejudiced and <br/>
when he went to see Joseph David insulted Joseph; and Joseph slapped <br/>
him in the face and kicked him out of the yard. This did David <br/>
good.</p>

<p>I could not sleep in those days. I spent many a night, all night <br/>
without sleeping at all. I prayed a good deal and my mind was <br/>
constantly active.</p>

<p>Brother [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C Rich]] gave an account of the the death of <br/>
David W. Patten. He said as we charged upon the mob two men <br/>
remained behind the back. Patten took after one of them and <br/>
I the other and the man that Patten took after turned round and <br/>
shot him and he fell to the gournd only but a few steps from me</p>

<p>In the prayer circle on Sunday the 28th <br/>
President Young spoke of [[James Jesse Strang|Strang]] and his death and so did [[John Milton Bernhisel|J. M.<br/>
Bernhisal]] who thought that [[George Miller|George Miller]] was also dead. George <br/>
A Smith said that he was informed that Miller had gathered <br/>
the followers of Strang about 60 in number. President Young <br/>
said they made a business of stealing but let men come here <br/>
and they would see that we had shown the works of industry</p>

<p>[[William Wines Phelps|Phelps]] said the man in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] <br/>
Court House who said he would kill Jo. Smith and if the Turkey <br/>
buzzards did not eat out his eyes they should eat out his own (Phelpes <br/>
stood withing a few feet of him) while going home the boat sunk and <br/>
he was drowned and he floated upon some floodwood and the buzzards<br/>
eat out his eyes and flesh. Phelps saw his body after this and a <br/>
man said he had fulfilled his own prophesy</p>

<p>Orson Hyde told of a man who was one of the first settlers of Missouri who helped to drive out the Saints <br/>
and it had since troubled him so much that he had sold out and </p>",

slowly to seperate</p>

<p>I was feeling a little better the next day<br/>
but still very weak and feeble. The dead flesh was parting in my<br/>
arm.</p>

<p>Next day I was able to walk to the [[Historian|Historian's<br/>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] asked [[William Wines Phelps|W<u>m</u> W. Phelps]] if astrology was true and Phelps<br/>
said ""I don't know."" President Young observed Brother Woodruff write that down <br/>
This is the first thing I ever heard of but what brother Phelps knew. He says <br/>
he dont know anything about astrology. But I believe it is true. So is <br/>
mesmerism or there is true principle in it</p>

<p>On Sunday the 29th in his remarks Wilford Woodruff<br/>
said he had faith in the doctrine taught by President Young for the rising <br/>
generation to go in foot instead of on horse back. He said ""I know <br/>
the good of it by experience. I travelled 1200 miles in one of my <br/>
journies on foot and averaged 40 miles a day; then waded the <br/>
Missi<strike>pp</strike>ssippi swamp from [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas|Little Rock]], Ark. to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Mamphis]] Tennesee <br/>
200 miles and only 16 miles out of water. One day I walked 60 miles <br/>
and while on journey walked 72 miles without eating and when I got <br/>
to [[Eagle Creek, Benton County, Tennessee|Eagle Creek]] with [[Warren Farr Parrish|Parrish]] I beleive I could have <strike>beaten</strike> ^killed^ any horse I <br/>
ever saw, walking to have followed it""</p>

<p>There is another thing I wish to speak of. We know <br/>
how things have been in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] the leaders of <br/>
the people were killed. If the time ever comes again when the <br/>
leaders of this people are called for I am opposed to their being given <br/>
up. I do not care what the consequences are for if any have <br/>
got to die let if be some of the rest of us who are not of as much <br/>
consequence as they are but I want them to live to lead Israel <br/>
as long as there is anybody to lead. Let us obey counsel in all <br/>
things and if necessary go into the mountains and we will increase<br/>
until the wicked will say let us not go against Zion to battle for <br/>
her sons are terrible and we cannot stand.""</p>

in commemoration of the en<strike>e</strike>try of the Pioneers into the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley of the <br/>
Great Salt Lake]]. On the first night we camped in the Big Cottonwood <br/>
where the brethren were cutting Granite for the [[Salt Lake City Temple, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]]. Brother <br/>
[[Charles Coulson Rich|Rich]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] and many others camped <br/>
with me. The whole road was lined with waggons for miles<br/>
and they camped wherever they could drive out of the road.</p>

<p>We arose the next morning before 3 o'clock <br/>
and started on our road. The Twelve followed the Presidency <br/>
and the guards. The string of waggons reached for many <br/>
miles. We arrived at the Campground at about 1<strike>3</strike>2 o'clock<br/>
and the last waggon did not arrive till near midnight. The <br/>

waggons; 1028 horses and mules 332 oxen and cows. Flags <br/>
were raised upon the highest peacks that surrounded us and <br/>
the stars and stripes were placed upon the highest trees. The <br/>
surrounding scenes of mountains valleys lakes woods and medows <br/>
made the sight the most interesting I ever beheld. We had <br/>
prayers at night and an address from President Young. There <br/>
were five bands of music in attendance.</p>

<p>Legislative Room Burned<br/>
Dec 26 1857</p>

<p>Early in the morning a report came that the [[Social Hall, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Social Hall]] was on fire<br/>
I soon went over and found the room which the Legislative Council occupied<br/>
nearly burned up and part of the chairs.</p>

<p>On the 31st I called upon President Young and<br/>
asked his opinion concerning a Cotton Company. He said the time had<br/>
come for us to act and not talk. If the people had done the same as<br/>
you and I have concerning sheep there would now have been a good supply<br/>
in this Territory. And with regard to Cotton I am now going to send<br/>
men into the Cotton Country to make cotton for me so that I can have some<br/>
to use myself and if you or any of the brethren wish to join me you can.</p>

<p>I looked over my Journal for the year 1857 and<br/>
made up my usual Synopsis and of the events of the year I recorded my<br/>
reflections of the day as follows.</p>

<p>""It has been an important year to Zion and the world<br/>
1857 will be the year on history's page from which will be dated the<br/>
commencement of the downfall of the United States. For it is during this<br/>
year that they have ent<strike>t</strike>ered the field as open enemies and persecuters of<br/>
the Saints of the Most High God and and have sent an army of 2500 men<br/>
over 1000 miles for the purpose of laying a foundation for the destruction<br/>
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who have settled here in<br/>
in the [[Great Basin|Great Bason]] of North America, called [[Utah Territory|Utah Territory]] or the State<br/>
of Deseret.</p>

<p>Here in the Valleys of the Mountains is established<br/>
the kingdom of God which [[Daniel (OT)|Daniel]] saw by vision and the people of<br/>
the United States are determined to destroy the Kingdom of God from<br/>
off the earth. But these judgements of God will now begin to rest<br/>
more fully upon that nation and will be increased upon them year by</p>",

<p>At 20 minutes past 9 o'clock three rounds <strike>of</strike>were <br/>
fired from a brass howitzer for the First Presidency of the Church. Other <br/>
rounds were also fired</p>

<p>Each one enjoyed himself as best he could through the day <br/>
and night. I took a walk with the Presidency to his upper mill <br/>
there were four built and one building. I never saw finer timber<br/>
in my life</p>

<p>At about noon Bishop [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. Smoot]] Elders [[Judson Stodard|Judson Studard]] <br/>
[[Orrin Porter Rockwell|O. P. Rockwell]] and Judge [[Elias Smith|Smith]] rode into camp. The two former from <br/>
the States in 20 days. They informed us that the United States<br/>
had taken away the mail contract and that a new Governor and <br/>
Judges and 2,500 troops would start for Utah soon. We went <br/>
into the President's tent and questions were asked and answered and <br/>
President Young said that if General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] crossed the South Pass<br/>
he should send him word that he must not come into the Valley <br/>
If the Governor and officers wished to come and would behave <br/>
themselves they should be well treated. President Young felt <br/>
determined no more to submit to oppression either of individuals<br/>
towns Counties States or nations</p>

<p>At daylight neat morning the company began <br/>
to break up to return to their homes</p>

<p>While in the endowment house President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] <br/>
said he wished me to write an account of the sayings of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the <br/>
Prophet when he pledged himself that he would not speak on a <br/>
certain occasion until all the 12 had spoken. So he had <br/>
to sit three quarters of a day and hear the Twelve express their <br/>
feelings and he could not say a word. He then said to the Twelve <br/>
""You have caught me this once; and now I want to give you some <br/>
advise. Never get caught as I have. Never go into a <br/>
corner unless you can see your way out in some manner.""</p>

through the States and tell the brethren to pick up their budgets <br/>

Let the brethren do this that go with the mail</p>

<p>The United States are fools to come upon <br/>
this people and so are th<strike>o</strike>ese men who are bringing great quanties <br/>
of goods unto us this season. If the United States send out <br/>
troops to fight us this season we shall whip them out. Then <br/>
they will send out reinforcements and then we shall have the <br/>
Lamanites with us and the more the United States send out <br/>
the worse off they will be for they will perish with famine <br/>
I do not think anything about guns or powder for if the <br/>
United States begin war with us I intend they shall furnish<br/>
us with arms and ammunition all we want. If they do <br/>
undertake it the Lord will lead them or let them go into a <br/>
snare and their folly will be manifest</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] said if you defeat <br/>
them you may look for one hundred thousand men</p>

<p>President Young said ""It will be so <br/>
much the worse for them; but I do not think he will get <br/>

birth through the sead of Abraham. This was the case with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] <br/>

save their grain and for each man to take what grain will do him <br/>
for a year.</p>

<p>Daniel H. Wells said that orders had been sent North and <br/>
South to watch for the soldiers and not let them come in but to <br/>
destroy them the best way they could. Let grain be chached in <br/>
the mountains so that they can get at it.</p>

<p>President Young said the <strike>t</strike>he thought it would be <br/>

coming and he would go out with cattle to bring it in or he would <br/>
do as he was told. Yes said President Young except a righteous <br/>

in the Historian's Office three hours and a half in hearing history<br/>
read. He asked if there had been any note made<br/>
of his meeting in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] at [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] house at the time<br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] preached the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and<br/>
Covenants as the Standards while ""I took the ground that<br/>
they were of no account to us without a living Prophet and<br/>
revelation."" I told President Young that I would examine<br/>
and see. I afterwards found that it was recorded in my<br/>
Daily Journal.</p>

<p>Next day I was reading History and President <br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] called. He said he told brother [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
to give me credit in the Church History for what he prints</p>",

<p>On Sunday the 3rd the subject arose about burning up our [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]]<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said I think we shall use this room for a few years to come<br/>
yet I mean to be ready.</p>

<p>The subject of the death of [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] ^came up^. A foreboding of his death he<br/>
felt strongly in spirit. As he was about to start for meeting He felt this<br/>
so much that he said there are some man in this city who thirsts for my blood. As<br/>
he was about to start for meeting this feeling was so strongly upon him that<br/>
he did not wish to go. Brother Pollard did not think there was any danger<br/>
but Brother Pratt made him promise that he would protect him until his return<br/>
before he would leave for the meeting. At this very time Mr [[Hector Hugh McLean|M<sup>c</sup>Clean]]<br/>
had taken lodgings adjoining Parley's room and was attending his meetings with<br/>
loaded weapons seeking an opportunity to kill him. [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
advised Parley P. Pratt not to go to [[Arkansas|Arkansas]] but to go direct to Salt Lake<br/>
and take care of himself. He told Parley if he went to try to Protect<br/>
[[Eleanor Jane McComb McLean Pratt|Eleanor]] and her children he would loose his life; but he did not take<br/>
care of himself nor take George A. Smith's counsel but went to Arkansas<br/>
and was murdered by Mr M<sup>c</sup>Clean</p>

Both houses sat together. The newspapers were called for and Captain<br/>
[[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit's]] report was read.</p>

the most important days of the Assembly. A strong Memorial was<br/>
presented to the Assembly and adopted and copies prepared for the signatures<br/>

Young was presented and read namely his correspondance with the United<br/>

<p>Synopsis of An Address<br/>
By President Brigham Young <br/>
Delivered August th 16th</p>

<p>When he arose he said he desired to speak as the Lord himself would were <br/>
he present. He then began clothed with the Spirit and power of <br/>
God, and the revelations of Jesus Christ. He recounted our persecutions <br/>
and oppressions for the last 25 years and then took up the unjust <br/>
course of the United States against us at the present time. Then he <br/>
told us and all the world what the will of God was and what his <br/>
intentions were. He would no longer submit to their ungo<strike>l</strike>dly persecutions<br/>
If General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] came here with an Army to destroy this people we <br/>
would destroy him and his army. They should not come into this <br/>
Territory nor into our cities to destroy this people. The United <br/>
States had turned mob and were breaking the Constitution of the <br/>
United States and we would now have to go forth and defend <br/>
it and also the Kingdom of God and should they undertake to <br/>
send an army of 50,000 or 100,000 next year we will lay waste <br/>
this whole Territory and flee into the mountains.</p>

<p>I will lay all my dwellings in ashes all my <br/>
mills in ashes. I will cut down every green ^tree^ and shrub in the Valleys</p>",
42829.0,131,,""">6th</time> I met with [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and a<br/>
company of Missionaries in the [[Seventies Hall, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Seventies' Hall]]. Parley P. Pratt<br/>
W. Woodruff [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zera Pulsipher]] [[Albert Perry Rockwood|A. P. Rockwood]] and<br/>
[[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|Horace S. Eldridge]] blessed 24 missionaries 20 of whom were<br/>
going to [[England|England]] and 4 to the States. We also ordained 2<br/>
Elders and one Seventy.</p>",
42829.0,224,,"<p>of these mountains. I will burn every piece of timber wood and board <br/>
in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valleys of the Mountains]]. Then do you not think that <br/>
our Kanyons will be a <u>depôt</u> for the bones of our enemies? I think <br/>
they will.</p>

<p>O Israel can you stand those things? (The shout of <br/>
""Yes!"" from the assembled thousands rent the air.) All you who are <br/>
willing to follow me in these things raise your hands towards heaven<br/>
(There were a sea of hands held up.)</p>

<p>I have had to hold the Indians here for years <br/>
from destroying the emigrants. I have had to give them <br/>
many thousands of dollars to keep them from killing the Gentile <br/>
emigration to [[California|California]]. The United States Government <br/>
now owe me $50,000 in my official capicity and they will not <br/>
pay me a dime but are sending armies at a great expense to destroy <br/>
me and this people.</p>

<p>But I will now inform them and all people <br/>
that if they attempt to make war upon me I shall not attempt <br/>
to restrain them any more but I shall let them do as they please.</p>

<p>The United States do not know what they <br/>
are doing and the merchants in this place do not know when <br/>
they are selling the blood of this people for gold. They were <br/>
not going to bring any goods to this place but now that an <br/>
army of 2,500 men are coming here to destroy this people they <br/>
can bring a great amount of goods. Let them take heed to <br/>
their ways.</p>

<p>If the United States send an army and a train <br/>
of goods here I may get a part of the pay which they owe me.</p>

<p>I now wish to say to all Gentiles. Send <br/>
word to your friends that they must stop crossing this continent to <br/>
California for the Indians will kill them for the emigrants <br/>
have slaughtered the Indians without any cause or provocation<br/>
and if the United States make war upon me I shall not attempt </p>",
42829.0,132,,"<p>Wilford Woodruff spoke to the Missionaries<br/>
for a short time and exhorted them to keep a Journal of their<br/>
ministry every day of their lives. He said I would advise<br/>
you to get all of your blessings written and preserve them</p>

<p>In writing your Journal I dont care of your<br/>
keeping an account of what you eat and drink or where you<br/>
sleep unless you should be in a desert or in a wilderness or on<br/>
a mountain and have nothing and then if the beast of the<br/>
field or the fowles of heaven come and feed you as the ravens<br/>
did [[Elisha (OT)|El<strike>ijah</strike>^sha^]] then I would have you record that but I do <strike>not</strike><br/>
feel to enjoyn it upon you to make a record of every official <br/>
act of your lives. If you baptize confirm ordain or<br/>
bless any person or administer to the sick write an account<br/>
of it. If you will do this the Church can obtain a<br/>
full and correct account</p>

<p>We are not apt to think of the importance<br/>
of events as they transpire with us but we feel the importance<br/>
of them afterwards. We are living in one of the most<br/>
important generations that man ever lived on the earth<br/>
and we should write an account of those important events<br/>
and transactions which are taking place before our eyes<br/>
in fulfilment of the prophecies and revelations of God<br/>
There are a great volume of revelations fulfilling in our<br/>
day and as they transpire before our eyes we want a <br/>
record made of them. If the power and blessings of<br/>
God are made manifest in your preservation from danger<br/>
and death you should make a record of it and keep an<br/>
account of the dealings of God with you daily</p>

<p>I have written all the blessings I<br/>
have received and would not take gold for them.</p>

<p>I am in the [[Historian|Historians Office]] and I<br/>
find it very difficult to get or find a record of events</p>",
42829.0,225,,"<p>to restrain them any longer.</p>

<p><strike>the privelge to leave</strike> I will give all people in this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] who wish to leave <br/>
the privelege to leave. I want all to leave who are not willing to follow <br/>
me. If there is any of my family my wives who wish to leave I will <br/>
send my teams and carry them wherever they wish to go. If it is to hell <br/>
I will drive them to the gate but will not let my teams go into hell but <br/>
they must turn round and come back but those who wish can enter in</p>

<p>I want the people to go to and save all their grain <br/>
and prepare to cache it up in the mountains but dont let your neighbor know <br/>
where you put it. I want you to prepare for a seven years siege.</p>

<p>Many other remarks were made and reported in <br/>
full by the reporters and all the congregation of the Saints felt to say Amen <br/>
to all that President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said</p>

<p>On the following Sunday I spent the day at the <br/>
[[Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]]. Brother [[William Holmes Walker|Walker]] spoke in the morning and told of his five <br/>
year mission to [[South Africa|South Africa]] and his return to America. He was <br/>
appointed to assist off the Handcart Emigration. He took charge of their <br/>
baggage which could not get away but wintered in [[Florence, Douglas County, Nebraska Territory|Florence]]. He started <br/>
the train this Spring which was on the way and would be here in a <br/>
few weeks.</p>

<p>He was followed by brother Rodgers who had been on <br/>
a mission to the [[Sandwich Islands|Sandwich Islands]]. He said but a few words and <br/>
then he was followed by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] who was filled <br/>
by the power of God and spoke quite lengthy. He said that if <br/>
the people would do as they were told they never should be driven <br/>
from the Valleys. If we have to take to our tents at all <br/>
we will not pitch them again as a resting place until we pitch <br/>
them in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]. He said that President Young said when <br/>
we first came into the Valley that we should lay up grain for <br/>
a seven years famine and we should let the land rest on the <br/>
seventh year. Brother Woodruff heard it. (Brother Woodruff <br/>
said it was written.) Now the United States are trying </p>",
42829.0,133,,""">Sunday the 7th</time> Elder [[Enoch B. Tripp|Tripp]] spoke. He<br/>
said he had called upon Mother Smith and she clasped him<br/>
in her arms. (They were formerly acquainted) and she said my<br/>
son Enoch I am glad to again see you: I am glad to see a man<br/>
again from [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake]]. She cried for joy and said she<br/>
had desired for two years to be with the Saints in the valleys<br/>
of the mountains but others had hindered her meaning [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma]]<br/>
The aged mother of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said give my love to [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>
and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] and all the faithful Saints for my heart is with<br/>
them.</p>

<p>In the evening after the Prayer Circle Brigham<br/>
Young [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] Wilford Woodruff and all at our circle<br/>
laid our hands upon Parley P. Pratt and blessed him: President<br/>
Young was mouth. I never heard a better blessing given <br/>
to man. It was not written at the time but afterwards<br/>
an outline was written by Elder Pratt and filed in the <br/>
[[Historian|Historians <strike>o</strike>Office]]. This blessing was given previous to<br/>
his going to the States where he was assassinated as he</p>",
42829.0,226,,"<p>to force a Governor upon us. We will not receive him. The Lord <br/>
has said our Governors shall procede out of the midst of us. This is in <br/>
the Bible. Brother Woodruff turn to it. (Brother Woodruff opened <br/>
the Bible promisciously and opened directly to the passage in the <br/>
30th Chapter of [[Jeremiah (OT)|Jeremiah]] 21<sup>st</sup> verse) and read it to the congregation)<br/>
Many remarks were made by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] all of which are <br/>
reported.</p>

<p>In the <strike>t</strike>Afternoon [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] was followed by [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel <br/>
H Wells]] who spoke in the Spirit and power of God concerning <br/>
Zion the Armies of Israel and the Armies of the wicked. He was <br/>
ready to fight and defend Zion.</p>

<p>August the 26th President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said I have sent <br/>
General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] word that I wish for peace and do not wish to fight <br/>
anybody but he must not come here with his armies. If he does <br/>
I shall stop him.</p>

<p>The President said to Brother Mathew<sup>s</sup> when you <br/>
get to [[California|California]] you cannot strengthen us; you must be upon <br/>
the watchtower. The nation is determined to make us free <br/>
They are determined to drive us to defend ourselves and become <br/>
indipendant. The nation is breaking to pieces in spirit. There <br/>
is no union among them and before the United States get through <br/>
trying to destroy us they will want to let out the job. I told <br/>
the people years ago that if they would let us alone we would <br/>
convert and revolutionize the world; and if they did not let us alone<br/>
but undertook to break us up we would spread abroad the faster <br/>
and do the work so much the sooner; and we will do it. If this <br/>
nation now makes war upon us we will be free and build up <br/>
the kingdom of God the sooner. The people have tried all the <br/>
time to destroy us but they have failed all the time.</p>

<p>When the Government called for 500 of <br/>
our men they had no idea that we should comply with their <br/>
request. This plan was laid to destroy the Saints and </p>",

<p>At the close of the blessing President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
remarked: ""I am going to take a mission I will name it here<br/>
I want to go through this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] with [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] and<br/>
[[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J M Grant]] and I want the Twelve to go. (Brother Parley observed<br/>
Brother Woodruff the Historian is all of the Twelve here). Brigham <br/>
said I want to go through among this people and preach the<br/>
Gospel to them if I can get rid of some of the care of my<br/>
temporal business. I do not feel that I am in the path of<br/>
my duty to spend so much of my time in attending to temporal<br/>
matters. I think more of one soul than I do all that<br/>
I have scraped together. I feel that with the assistance<br/>
of my brethren I could make a great wake by going through<br/>
this Territory and preaching the Gospel to the people. I feel<br/>
that some men ought never to be called upon to do a day's<br/>
work but they should spend their time in p<strike>e</strike>reaching the <br/>
Gospel. They should have a man to take care of<br/>
their families. This should be the case with Parley<br/>
P. Pratt. He should spend his time preaching. We <br/>
should devote our time to the ministry as far as possible</p>

<p>When I returned home I found sister<br/>
[[Ruth Daggett Vose Sayers|Sayers]] and sister [[Augusta Adams Cobb Young|Cobb]] at my house. Sister Sayers wished<br/>
me to bless her as she was going to the States on a mission<br/>
I laid my hands upon her and blessed her and said that<br/>
all should be right with her and that she should be prospered<br/>
on her journey and return in peace.</p>

<p>Next day I wrote a letter to Dr<br/>
[[Asa Fitch|Asa Fitch]] of [[New York|New York]] and sent him a tin box of insects<br/>
from Utah including one Tarantula 2 bugs called Scorpian's <br/>
Miller 1 Tobacco-worm miller one small spider and<br/>
several grasshoppers ^&amp;c^</p>

<p>On the following day I wrote a letter</p>",
42829.0,227,,"<p>[[Thomas Benton|Thomas Benton]] then had orders in his pocket to destroy the Mormons if they <br/>
refused.</p>

<p>Jesus said the time would come when we should have to sell <br/>
our coat and buy a sword. That time has come and we have got to <br/>
go to and deliver ourselves from our enemies and the Lord will help us <br/>
He will fight our battles and we shall become an indipendent kingdom.</p>

<p>I feel well and I will tell you why. If I am right <br/>
and I know I am and that this people are much nearer their Father's face <br/>
than they ever were before. They are united and willing to do the <br/>
will of God and this causes me to rejoice.</p>

<p>This people now feel to say it is the Kingdom of <br/>
God or nothing. It is not my farm or my house but the Kingdom <br/>
of God. This is the case with this people. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] <br/>
said Old Buck was now free. The yoke was off his <strike>h</strike>neck and <br/>
it would not be on his neck again.""</p>

<p>On the same day President [[Brigham Young|Young]] came into <br/>
the [[Historian|Historian's Office]] and sent for me for I was at home and I immediately <br/>
went to the office where I found President Young [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H Wells]] and <br/>
[[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D. Richards]]. As I came in the President said to <br/>
me have you a team. I told him that I had a pair of small ponies <br/>
He asked if I could spare them. I hesitated a moment and <br/>
said Yes sir I can do anything that is wanted. He then said I have <br/>
a good pair of horses that I want to let you have as you are laboring <br/>
here. I was taken by surprise for it came very unexpectedly <br/>
to me. I accepted the horses and was thankful though <br/>
perhaps I did not say it at the time. Brother Wells went <br/>
and showed them to me and I took them home. They were a <br/>
fine large pair of sorrel horses and they were offered 200 bushels <br/>
of wheat for them that day.</p>

<p>President Young stayed 3 1/2 hours compiling <br/>
his history. He remarked that the revelation upon plurality <br/>
of wives was given to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] in 1831. He revealed it to </p>",

nor act upon it but he did act upon it in a secret manner and that was <br/>
the cause of his overthrow.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] also said that the United States are <br/>
driving this people to war sooner than is for their good for we are <br/>
civilizing the Indians and if they would give us time we would give <br/>
them a knowledge so that when they do fight the Gentiles they <br/>
would have the judgement and not kill women and children and they who <br/>
ought not to be killed. There are now many of the emigration on <br/>
the way to [[Carson Valley, Utah Territory|Carson Valley]]. The Gentile emigrants shoot the Indians <br/>
wherever they meet with them and the Indians will now retali<strike>t</strike>ate and <br/>
will kill innocent people. One woman who had fitted out to <br/>
home here to investigate Mormonism was killed and all her <br/>
teamsters and all these were killed through the folly of emigrants.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 30th of August we had <br/>
a good day. The Presidency and several others of the leaders spoke <br/>
In the evening at the Prayer Circle the contemptible speech of <br/>
[[Stephen Arnold Douglas|Stephen Arnold Doglass]] was read and the answer of [[Albert Carrington|Albert <br/>
Carrington]] to the speech was also read. Also the instruction <br/>
of Governor Young in case we were invaded by an enemy <br/>
Many remarks were made upon the apparently approaching <br/>
crisis. President Young said that many of the brethren <br/>
had many fears about the Lamanites because the Gentiles <br/>
were making them presents. You need to have no fears <br/>
upon the subject for if the nation gives them a few million <br/>
it will not be all that is their due and then they will turn round <br/>
and take the rest. We need have no fears but what <br/>
the Lamanites will be prepared to fill their mission. I cannot <br/>
feel that the time has come for us to do a great deal of hard <br/>
fighting. We shall have help and strength and the promises <br/>
of God will be verified unto us.</p>

<p>I met the brethren connected with the Historian's Office<br/>
and told them my feelings was to dedicate the place unto<br/>
the Lord and so we all knelt down excepting [[John Varah Long|J V Long]]<br/>
who was scribe and I offored up the prayer of which the<br/>

[[Chief Kanosh|Kanosh]] the Chief of the Parvants and [[Amon Walker|Amon Walker's]] brother. President <br/>
Young had an interview with the Indians for about one hour. Mr [[Ira Button Eddy|Eddy]] <br/>
came into the office and spent several hours looking at our works. He was <br/>
the partener of Mr [[Christian Sharps|Sharp]] the inventor of the Sharp's rifles.</p>

<p>We had an express arrive on the morning of the 5th <br/>
stating that Col. [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] was at [[Ash Hollow, Garden County, Nebraska Territory|Ash Hollow]] with some 2000 men <br/>
travelling some 15 miles per day. Col. Sumner had burned some <br/>
300 Ch<strike>e</strike>ians lodges and killed some few Indians and 2 soldiers were <br/>
killed and 7 wounded. Sixty men with Captain [[Dan Jones|Jones]] and the wounded <br/>
were sent to [[Fort Kearny, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Kerney]] and the Chians overtook them and cut them <br/>
to pieces so bad that no trace of them could be found.</p>

to look upon and behold the wreck and relic of a man who once <br/>
was an Apostle and the President of the Apostles but who had apostatized <br/>
and staid in the world until he had become old a cripple palsied <br/>
miserable unhappy and worthless so much so that his wife the <br/>

He had now come to the Saints for mercy and help. President<br/>

Holy Priesthood vested in us and in the name of Jesus Christ we do<br/>

that it may contain the holy records of the Church and Kingdom of God<br/>
and we ask in the name of Jesus Christ that it may be sanctified<br/>
and holy unto thy name and we pray that we may be inspired by the<br/>
gift and power of the Holy Ghost while acting as historians or clerks<br/>

and history of thy Church and Kingdom and of thy servants and may<br/>
it be kept in that way and manner that it may be acceptable unto<br/>

labours in this [[Historian|office]], or place in his mind</p>

42829.0,230,,"<p>[[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|B Marsh]] arose and addressed the people for a short time and warned the <br/>
people not to apostatize and to look to him as an example of misery <br/>
and one who had suffered the wrath of God in consequence of denying <br/>
the faith. He wished to be forgiven by the Church. President <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] put the vote to the assembly if they would receive him into full <br/>
fellowship notwithstanding all his heinous sins. All voted to a <br/>
man to receive him.</p>

<p>In the Prayer meeting in the President's upper <br/>
room in the evening we heard letters read from [[Samuel Whitney Richards|Samuel Richards]] <br/>
[[Samuel Comstock Snyder|Snider]] [[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|H. S. Eldridge]] and [[Nicholas Groesbeck|Gooseback]]. President Young said <br/>
Brother [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] I presume we shall not have any one in Congress <br/>
next Winter to present our memorials and interest. (J. M. Bernhisel <br/>
I think not.) I think it will make some of the people squirm <br/>
when they hear that I am taking the property which the Goverment <br/>
has sent into this Territory. Some of our brethren going down <br/>
to the States met about 60 of the Chians. They were very friendly <br/>
to them. The Indians stole 800 fat cattle and the rest were driven <br/>
back to the States so the Army has no cattle with them only for <br/>
their present use.</p>

<p>Some said that they beleived that the Indians <br/>
who stole the cattle were half Mormons and began to damn them <br/>
Brother [[John Murdock|Murdock]] remarked we are all Mormons here in this <br/>
company and I dont wish to hear my friends abused</p>

<p>President Young said what will <br/>
the people of Europe think when they come to her that Brigham <br/>
Young is at the head of the Viglance Committee in [[California|California]] <br/>
and the [[Kansas|Kansas]] troubles and that the Government of the <br/>
United States could not remove him until the Lord saw fit <br/>
to let them.</p>

<p>The world accuse me of controling the affairs of <br/>
of California and Kansas &amp;c. The people believe that we <br/>
have a band called the Danites but how could they exist so </p>",

<p>Word was brought in the evening before that two of the Hand-<br/>
Cart Companies were camped between the two mountains and<br/>
would be in to-day. So President [[Brigham Young|Young]] called together<br/>
a body of Lanceers ""[[Domenico Ballo|Ballo's]] Brass Band"" and the ""Nauvoo<br/>
Brass Band"" and with President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]]<br/>
Professor [[Albert Carrington|Carrington]] and many other citizens <strike>he</strike>in carriages<br/>
he went out to meet them and to escort them into<br/>

42829.0,231,,"<p>long without sheding blood for we cannot find that they have killed anybody <br/>
But I do not know of any such men</p>

<p>I think that [[James Buchanan|James Buchannan]] has got into a bad <br/>
fix. He has got the yoke on his neck and has to carry it alone with <br/>
no ox to carry the other end. But he is pounding his own shins and <br/>
will soon pound the shins of others for the moment he gave consent to send <br/>
an army to destroy this people he placed himself as the shedder of innocent <br/>
blood and the judgements of God will follow him. When war does break <br/>
out between the North and the South it will be most bloody</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] said that the only way <br/>
for the President of the United States to get out of his troubles was to <br/>
get a bill through Congress to admit any Territory as soon as they had <br/>
population enough to organize a State Government and to be received <br/>
at once into the Union with equal privileges with the other States</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] then said let me suggest a <br/>
matter. Brother Smith is presiding at [[Fort Limhi, Oregon Territory|Limhi]] [[Salmon River, Oregon Territory|Salma River]]. Now <br/>
do we not want a station half way from here; say near [[Fort Hall, Oregon Territory|Fort Hall]] <br/>
Should we not send men, say 20 to make a Station there. (It was <br/>
thought best to do so) He said the North is the place for us <br/>
not the South. No one but the Saints would meet the cold <br/>
North country. This is the key of this continant and I think we <br/>
had better keep near the lock and have the key in our own hands<br/>
If we send a company we want to send them this fall so that we <br/>
can put in grain this season.</p>

<p>On the 8th Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] of the <br/>
United States service arrived in the city in the evening and <br/>
he had an interview with Governor Young</p>

<p>On the next day Captain Van Vleit met with the <br/>
Governor the Presidency and Twelve and some 100 citizens in the Social <br/>
Hall at 9 o'clock. He presented Governor Young with a <br/>
letter of instructions or request which was read before the Assembly <br/>
and but little said and a great deal thought.</p>",
42829.0,139,,"<p>They met the companies at the foot of the [[Little Mountain, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Little Mountain]]<br/>
on the west side of it. Elder [[Edmund Ellsworth|Edmund Elsworth]] son-in-law to [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]] was the captain of the first company and [[Daniel Duncan McArthur|Daniel D. M<sup>c</sup>Arthur]]<br/>
was the captain of the second company. Both companies consisted<br/>
of 96 Hand-carts 8 waggons and 486 souls</p>

<p>It was a very affecting meeting. Presidents Young<br/>
and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] walked up the Mountain through the company and saluted<br/>
the Saints and then organized the company for travelling into the city<br/>
One half of the company of Lancers went in front followed by the<br/>
Presidency and citizens; then the Marshal of the city [[Jesse Carter Little|Jesse C Little]];<br/>
then the bands of music. After the escort came Captain Edmund<br/>
Elsworth with his Hand-cart Company and then Daniel D McArthur<br/>
followed with the second Hand-cart Company and the remainder<br/>
of the company of Lancers brought up the rear. In this way<br/>
they started for the city</p>

<p>Captain [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]] took Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]]<br/>
and myself into a buggy and we met the company as they entered<br/>
the borders of the city and we fell into the ranks behind the Presidency</p>

<p>The people of the city gathered on each side<br/>
of the road and the streets. It was affecting to see such a<br/>
strange sight of about five hundred people enter the city of the<br/>
[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]] who had travelled on foot one thousand five<br/>
hundred miles drawing their handcarts all the way. Women<br/>
children and old men had drawn their bedding clothing and food<br/>
all the way and this company of the poor Saints from [[England|England]]<br/>
had travelled the whole distance in nine weeks. They were<br/>
covered with dust and somewhat worn down but cheerful. They<br/>
had beaten any horse or ox teams during the time</p>

<p>The Handcart companies passed up on<br/>
South Temple Street, the Deseret Store, by Wilford Woodruff's<br/>
house down to the Grove and then down to the public square<br/>
and there formed into two lines and camped for the night.</p>",
42829.0,232,,"<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] asked if there was lumber to be <br/>
bought and grain and hay &amp;c. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said that there was <br/>
plenty in the country and asked if there was any one person who could <br/>
supply Captain Van Vleit with any lumber that he might want <br/>
Brother [[Samuel Comstock Snyder|Samuel Snider]] arose and said he could supply 10,000 feet <br/>
of lumber. No one else said anything</p>

<p>President Young had a private conversation with <br/>
Captain Van Vleit in the afternoon and walked with him through <br/>
his garden and orchard and through Professor [[Albert Carrington|Carrington's]]. The <br/>
Captain asked Mrs [[Rhoda Maria Woods Carrington|Carrington]] if she was willing to cut down her <br/>
fine peach orchard for her faith and religion. She said yes <br/>
and would set up nights to do it if it became necessary.</p>

<p>On the next day President Young took the <br/>
Captain through his house and introduced him to his family</p>

<p>On the 12th we got an express in the <br/>
morning saying that there were some 900 troops on the way this <br/>
side of the [[Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]] and some 12 Government baggage trains.</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] came into the [[President|Office]] <br/>
this day and President Young had a good deal of talk with him.<br/>
He said I do not want to fight the United States but if they drive us <br/>
to it we shall do the best we can and I tell you as God lives we <br/>
shall come off conquerer for we trust in God. For God has<br/>
set up his kingdom upon the earth and it will never fall but it will <br/>
stand. We shall do all we can not to fight but if they drive us to it <br/>
God will overthrow them. If they would let us alone and say to the <br/>
mobs now you may go and kill the <strike>m</strike>Mormons if you can but we <br/>
will have nothing to do with it, this is all we would ask of them <br/>
But for the Government of the United States to array their armies <br/>
against us it is too dispicable and damnable for any honourable nation <br/>
and God will have them in derision for doing it</p>

<p>The Government has all the time <br/>
endeavoured to destroy us in an underhanded manner; but now if</p>",
42829.0,140,,"<p>As soon as they were camped President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
stood up in his carriage and called upon the Bishops and<br/>
multitude who had gathered together to see the Handcart Companies<br/>
to bring them provisions and feed them to night to morrow<br/>
morning and noon and night again and while they stop here<br/>
I wish you all to tarry here until you are dismissed and I bless<br/>
you all in doing good and keeping the commandments of God</p>

<p>We then returned to our homes and<br/>
the Bishops and people brought the Hand Cart companies <br/>
all the provisions necessary</p>

<p>Captain [[Edmund Ellsworth|Edmund Elsworth]] saluted his wives and<br/>
children as he passed his house but did not stop for anything<br/>
until his company was camped. He led the First Handcart<br/>
company by drawing the front handcart with three other^s^<br/>
breathren drawing their handcarts with him in the frontrank</p>

<p>Next day I call upon President Young<br/>
upon Church business. Among other things he said he<br/>
thought these hand cart compan<strike>y</strike>i^es^ had a better time than the<br/>
teams had. ""They have not had as hard a time as<br/>
we had in going to [[Missouri|Missouri]] in 183<strike>3</strike>^4^. Then I went<br/>
to Missouri stayed in the cholera 15 days then returned to <br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] within three months making over 3000 miles <strike>which</strike><br/>
^and^ I walked all the way and <strike>lay</strike> ^laid^ on the ground every night; but<br/>
if I had to fit out a company I would have fitted out the<br/>
carts different to what they were.""</p>

<p>During the moring Presidents Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
[[Albert Carrington|Albert Carrington]] Edmund Elsworth and myself rode down<br/>
to the Public Square to visit the Handcart Companies. The<br/>
emigrant Saints generally looked well and cheerful. They<br/>
shook our hands warmly. There was a great quantity<br/>
of provisions on hand in the camp brought in by the citizens<br/>
I laid hands upon one of the bretheren who was taken sick</p>",
42829.0,233,,"<p>they come against us we will whip them all the time and you will see that <br/>
we will do it. The United States are sending their armies to hold us still <br/>
until a mob can come and kill us and they have done this all the time</p>

<p>We are the supporters of the United States Constitution <br/>
and we love the Constitution and laws of the United States but it is the <br/>
corrupt administeration of those laws that we are suffering under and <br/>
not the laws.</p>

<p>If the laws had been carried out in the [[Missouri|Missouri]] it would have <br/>
hung Governor [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]] between the heavens and the earth and all his friends <br/>
who was in the murdering and expelling of the Saints from the States. They <br/>
shot down the Mormons whenever they could. They killed [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and <br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]. Then when Col. [[John J. Hardin|Hardan]] came into [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with his armies <br/>
he did not enquire who killed Joseph Smith and Hyrum nor any of the <br/>
Saints who had been killed but enquired for some missing man that we <br/>
knew nothing about and said he should hold me responsible for the life <br/>
of that man.</p>

<p>This has been the course with the Government all the time <br/>
We got up a ""memorial"" or ""Declaration"" to the Congress of the United <br/>
States last Winter</p>

<p>The Declaration was then read to Captain Van Vleit who <br/>
after hearing it said, ""I cannot find any fault with it only it is couched in <br/>
very strong language."" President Young replied, ""That is what I intended <br/>
and I will now ask Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] if [[William Wormer Drummond|Drummond]] was not the main <br/>
cause of the United States sending their armies against us?""</p>

<p>The Captain said ""I think it is;"" and the President <br/>
continued, ""There is not any of the Government officers which have been <br/>
sent here who have any interests with us but they have tried to destroy <br/>
us.</p>

<p>Captain Van Vleit said this is the case with most men in the <br/>
Territories. They receive their offices as steping stones to the senatorship <br/>
but they have no interest with the people. This people have been <br/>
lied about the worst of ^any^ people I ever saw. The greatest hold the </p>",
42829.0,141,,"<p>during the night. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said the people might have<br/>
their handcarts</p>

<p>Brother [[Edmund Ellsworth|Elsworth]] pointed out a mule which he rode<br/>
after a Buffalo which he had wounded. The mule took right<br/>
after the buffalo and the mad wounded animal turned and<br/>
took after the mule. They almost met together when the<br/>
^mule^ turned and ran back so suddenly that he threw Elsworth to the<br/>
ground. The buffalo plunged at him and Elsworth<br/>
punched the aminal with the mu<strike>g</strike>zgle of his gun in the<br/>
eye so hard a blow that the buffalo fell to his knees but got<br/>
up again and ran away. It broke the rifle. Brother Elsworth<br/>
was a very strong man. His mule ran five miles to camp<br/>
and he had to walk</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday and several of the<br/>
returned missionaries spoke to the congregation</p>

<p>The Place Where [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] Offered His First Sacrifice</p>

<p>President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] said I have told the people to day<br/>
far greater things than drawing hand carts to Zion [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph<br/>
Smith]] took President Brigham Young and myself to the very<br/>
spot in [[Adam-ondi-Ahman, Daviess County, Missouri|Adam-Ondi-Aman]] where Adam offered up his first<br/>
sacrifice on a spot now called Hogback</p>

<p>Dream of [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H Wells]]</p>

<p>Daniel H Wells said I had a dream last night and I saw a<br/>
butcher's cleaver in the heavens in the East and I tried to ^show it to^ Bishop<br/>
[[David Pettegrew|Pettigrew]] and he could not see it. I felt that there was a struggle<br/>
near and a great slaughter and much nearer than the people<br/>
are aware of</p>

<p>President Kimball said it would be better</p>",
42829.0,234,,"<p>world have now upon you is they accuse you of burning 900 vol<sup><u>s</u></sup> of the <br/>
United States Statutes</p>

<p>[[Thomas Williams|Thomas Williams]] who was one of the oweners of the <br/>
books which were burned denies that there were any of the books of the <br/>
United States burned.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said I have told the people all the <br/>
time that all I asked of them was to tell the truth about us to pay <br/>
their debts steal nothing and they are welcome to go their way</p>

<p>Now if this Government was arrived at that State<br/>
that they will try to kill the people for their religion no honourable men should <br/>
be afraid of them.</p>

<p>President Young then told the story about the Qu<strike>c</strike>aker<br/>
whom the Yankee went to whip. The quaker said that he was not <br/>
the man that he wanted. He had not done anything wrong but the <br/>
man said he would whip him anyhow. So the quaker laid <br/>
down his hat and coat and said ""Lie there religion until I whip this man""<br/>
and he did whip tremendiously. It will be so with the United <br/>
States. If they insist in whipping us they will get awfully whipped</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]], we have treated all <br/>
men as well as we have you who have been sent here as officers of the <br/>
the United States Government. We wish still to treat them well <br/>
and we would like to ward off this blow if we could. But the <br/>
United States are determined to drive us to fight. We cannot do <br/>
anything but what the Government will take exception to it. They <br/>
will kill us if they can. I have proof of this. They killed <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] in jail notwithstanding the faith of the Governor<br/>
the army and the States was pledged to protect them and when they <br/>
had killed them they got a writ for me. I carried a large bowie <br/>
knife with and I said that any man who laid hands upon my <br/>
sholder and said Mr Young you are my prisoner I would send <br/>
that man to hell across lots. I have said that all the time <br/>
since and I say it now</p>",

<p>President Young called upon Heber C Kimball to be<br/>
mouth in the Dedication Prayer. The following is a <br/>
Synopsis of it reported by Wilford Woodruff</p>

<p>""O, God the Eternal Father, we bow down<br/>
before thee on this Font which has been made by thy servants<br/>
to baptize thy people in, for the purpose of dedicating it unto<br/>
the Lord our God.</p>

<p>We dedicate ourselves before thee O Lord<br/>
and we ask thee in the name of Jesus Christ to forgive us all<br/>
our sins, that we may have thy Holy Spirit to guide us in<br/>
all things that we may be guided in the ways of the Lord and<br/>
that we may never do wrong. Look upon us O God who<br/>
have now bowed before thee around this Font and help us to<br/>
do thy will in all things, acknowledge thee in all things<br/>
and honour thee and worship thee at all times. Help </p>",
42829.0,235,,"<p>I have broken no law, neither will I be taken by any <br/>
United States officers to be killed as they have killed [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. They did once <br/>
take a bogus [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] which was brother [[William Miller, b. 1814|Miller]] and took him to [[Carthage Jail, Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] and <br/>
did not find out his mistake until they got him there</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] said I do not think that it is the <br/>
intention of the Government to take you but to install a new Governor in this <br/>
Territory.</p>

<p>President Young replied ""I believe you tell the truth—that you believe <br/>
this but you do not know their intentions as well as I do. When you  get <br/>
away from here you will think of a great many things which you have seen <br/>
and heard. The people have all the time accused us of colleaguing <br/>
with the Indians against the Government and they were much afraid that <br/>
Joseph Smith would go among the Indians and they watched to keep him <br/>
away from them but now they have driven us into their midst. And<br/>
now I want you to watch the signs and you will see that God will work <br/>
against the nation who are trying to destroy both the Indians and the <br/>
Mormons. The Government has become corrupt and they are the <br/>
ones who are breaking the Constitution of the United States and if it is <br/>
ever saved it will be saved by the Mormons who are the Elders <br/>
of Israel.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 13th after [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] had spoken President <br/>
Young followed and said that he had the persecution of the Saints before <br/>
him all the morning, that he was righteously angry; that he was <br/>
so angry he could not preach. But he did preach in the power of <br/>
God and told his feelings.</p>

<p>Captain Van Vleit sat by and when President <br/>
Young spoke of the wickedness and corruption of the Government it made <br/>
him feel</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting we met with the Missionaries who <br/>
were appointed to lecture upon home manufactures. We then went <br/>
into council with the Presidency to select a company of Missionaries <br/>
to go and make a settlement on Blackfoot Fork 63 volunteered</p>",
42829.0,143,,"<p>us to honour our tabernacles that we may never disgrace ourselves in<br/>
anything. Grant unto us thy Holy Spirit that it may quicken<br/>
our understanding and bring to our rememberance all things which are<br/>
necessary for us in the discharge of our duties.</p>

<p>We now dedicate this Font to thee O, God. We<br/>
consecrate it unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ. Let thy<strike>ine</strike><br/>
angel O Lord touch this water and this Font with his finger that<br/>
it may be holy unto the Lord. May no unclean thing ever<br/>
enter into this font to polute it. We dedicate ourselves our<br/>
wives children and all that we have unto thee O Lord our God<br/>
May we be thine for ever and all that we have</p>

<p>Now O Lord accept of this dedication at<br/>
our hands and as we go into this water may our sins be forgiven<br/>
and not be remembered against us any more. May we feel<br/>
the power of God and have power to work a great reformation<br/>
among this people; and may this people triumph over our<br/>
enemies; and may not our enemies <strike>h</strike>ever again have power<br/>
over us. But wil<strike>l</strike>t thou cause thine indignation to burn<br/>
against them that they shall not have any power to do thy<br/>
people harm.</p>

<p>Now O Lord look down upon thy servant<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham]] and clothe him with thy power that he may know the<br/>
workings of the power of the Devil in the Church and among<br/>
this people; and may he have power to stretch forth his<br/>
hand unto thy people and do thy work.</p>

<p>We now dedicate this font to baptize the<br/>
living and the living for the dead and for every purpose which<br/>
is necessary to perform the work of the Lord our God even that<br/>
the generations which are dead and passed away may be saved<br/>
and that the sins of the living may be washed away and<br/>
that the sick may be healed of every infirmity that we <br/>
may be renewed in body and spirit in all things. </p>",
42829.0,236,,"<p>and 42 of them were chosen.</p>

<p>At the close of this Council I went direct to the <br/>
meeting at the [[Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] and during the afternoon President [[Brigham Young|Young]] spoke and <br/>
gave Uncle Sam considerable hell fire for their wickedness. We then <br/>
went into our Prayer Circle and President Young feasted the brethren upon <br/>
peaches and grapes as we had nothing to eat during the day. At the <br/>
close of prayers Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] met us at the stairs and said he <br/>
had an express from the States and wished to meet with Governor Young</p>

<p>President Young's Last, Important Interview with Cap. Van Vleit<br/>
Sunday Evening Sep<sup><u>r</u></sup> 13, 1857</p>

<p>In the evening I went to Captain [[William Henry Hooper|Hooper's]] and met with Captain <br/>
Van Vleit, and a short time after President Brigham Young [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]] <br/>
[[Albert Carrington|A. Carrington]] [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and a number of others came in. <br/>
Captain Van Vleit was preparing to leave at 3 o'clock in the morning <br/>
and President Young was now to have his last interview with him and <br/>
he wish^ed^ to talk to him in a plain manner</p>

<p>President Young said he wished Captain Van Vleit <br/>
to report at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] just as things were here. He said I have <br/>
seen the sufferings of this people through their persecutions from the <br/>
people of the United States for the last 25 years and I will not hear it <br/>
any longer.</p>

<p>We have always treated the United States officers well but <br/>
they have constantly lied about us and tried to destroy us all the <br/>
time. We would still have received their Governors and officers<br/>
if they had sent them here without an army; but inasmuch as they <br/>
are now disposed to send an army here to hold as while others run <br/>
their red hot iron into us and then kill us we will now say we <br/>
will not have either their soldiers armies or officers any more here <br/>
at all and you may tell them so. We will just fight for <br/>
our liberty and rights from this day forth.</p>",

<p>Confirmation of Heber C Kimball</p>

<p>After the President had baptized his Counsellors Heber C<br/>
Kimball and J. M. Grant he confirmed and blessed Heber as <br/>
follows:</p>

<p>Brother Heber Chase; In the name of Jesus Christ<br/>
I lay my hands upon your head and I confirm you to be<br/>
a member in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<br/>
and I seal upon you the gift of the Holy Ghost and Eternal<br/>
Life and I ordain and seal upon your head to be a<br/>
Prophet Seer and Revelator in the Church and Kingdom of<br/>
God and every blessing which has been sealed upon you and<br/>
we seal upon you the Gift of the Holy Ghost and we seal you<br/>
up unto Eternal Life in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.</p>

<p>[sideways text] ^correct^ [end of sideways text]</p>

<p>Confirmation of Jedediah M. Grant.</p>

<p>Heber C Kimball then said;</p>

<p>""Brother Jedediah, In the name of Jesus<br/>
Christ we lay our hands upon your head and we confirm</p>",
42829.0,237,,"<p>Whenever I think of letting their troops come in here and their <br/>
officers I can see nothing but death and darkness before me and before this people<br/>
but when I say they shall not come here light bursts upon me and I can see <br/>
light before me and this people and this is the way all of this people feel</p>

<p>The intention of the Government is to destroy us and <br/>
we are determined they shall not do it. If the Government of the United <br/>
States persists in sending armies to destroy us, in the name of the Lord<br/>
we shall conquer them. If the Government calls for volunteers in <br/>
[[California|California]] and the people turn out to come to destroy us they will find their <br/>
own building in flames before they get far from home and so throughout <br/>
the United States</p>

<p>Again if they commence the war I shall not hold the <br/>
Indians still by the wrist any longer for white man to shoot at them; but I <br/>
shall let them go ahead and do as they please and I shall carry the war<br/>
into their own land and they will want to let out the job before they <br/>
get half through. And even should an army of 50,000 men<br/>
get into this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] when they get here they would find nothing but <br/>
a barren waste.</p>

<p>We shall burn everything that is wood and we should <br/>
burn every acre of grass and you may tell them that they must bring<br/>
with them their forage for their horses and mules for they will not <br/>
find anything to eat in this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] when they come</p>

<p>Again you may tell them they must stop all <br/>
emigration across this continent for they cannot travel in safety. The <br/>
Indians will kill all who attempt it. You may tell Judge [[Stephen Arnold Douglas|Douglass]]<br/>
that when he comes here again to enter into a treaty of peace we <br/>
shall dictate those terms of peace and not he as he did before</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] said that if our Government <br/>
pushed forward this thing and made war against us he should <br/>
withdraw from the army for he would not have a hand in <br/>
shedding the blood of American Citizens</p>

<p>After closing his remarks President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said</p>",
42829.0,145,,"<p>you to be a member in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and we<br/>
seal upon you all the keys of the Holy Priesthood even to be a Prophet Seer<br/>
and Revelator in the Church and Kingdom of God and every blessing which<br/>
has ever been sealed upon you and we seal upon you the gift of the Holy<br/>
Ghost; and we seal you up unto Eternal Life in the name of Jesus<br/>
Christ: Amen</p>

<p>Baptisim and Confirmation of [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] by [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]]</p>

<p>Heber C Kimball then baptized President Brigham Young and<br/>
assisted by [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah M. Grant]] he confirmed and blessed him as <br/>
follows:</p>

<p>Brother Brigham Young we lay our hands upon your<br/>
head and confirm you to be a member in the Church of Jesus<br/>
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and we seal upon your head the<br/>
Holy <strike>Ghost</strike> Priesthood with all the keys powers and blessings<br/>
appertaining thereunto even to be a Prophet Seer and Revelator<br/>
in the Church and Kingdom of God and over the house of Israel<br/>
and we seal upon your head all the blessings which were<br/>
sealed upon you by the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. And we say unto you<br/>
that you shall have power over your enemies and you shall<br/>
not be slain by them but you shall live to see them overthrown<br/>
and to see the Saints come off victorious over their enemies<br/>
And I seal these blessings upon you<strike>r</strike> in the name of Jesus <br/>
Christ: Amen</p>

<p>Baptism and Confirmation of Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>President Brigham Young then baptized me and all the<br/>
Presidency laid their hands upon me and confirmed and<br/>
blessed me. President Jedediah M. Grant was mouth.</p>

<p>""Brother Wilford Woodruff in the name of Jesus</p>",
42829.0,238,,"<p>God had set up his kingdom upon the earth and it was here and the Lord<br/>
would sustain that Kingdom and he would destroy all who fought<br/>
against it; and if the armies of the United States come against <br/>
us the Lord would permit them to be destroyed</p>

<p>At the close of the remarks the President<br/>
said to Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] as citizens we are friends and shook <br/>
hands in a friendly manner and wished each other well. We all <br/>
wished the Captain well.</p>

<p>I then went home and put up a box of peaches <br/>
of 32 dozen for the Hon. [[John Milton Bernhisel|J. M. Bernhisel]] and Captain Van Vleit.<br/>
I then went to the [[Historian|Historian's Office]] and from thence to President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] <br/>
[[President|Office]] and conversed with President Young [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] and [[Albert Carrington|Carrington]] until <br/>
midnight. This day J. M. Bernhisel was set apart for his <br/>
mission to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]. I wrote his blessing</p>

<p>On the 1<strike>6</strike>4th of September in the afternoon <br/>
President Young met in Council with [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] Daniel H Wells<br/>
and the Twelve and several others and resolved to proclaim the <br/>
[[Utah Territory|Territory]] under marshal law. The Proclamation of the Governor <br/>
was read and accepted</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th an express arrived from <br/>
the brethren in the Mountains. They brought word that 700 of <br/>
the army were at the Pacific Springs and that they kept but five <br/>
men on guard to take charge of their animals and they would not give <br/>
them guns for fear they would run away. They were travelling<br/>
about 15 miles per day. Their animals were much worn down<br/>
and the feed was scarce. Our own brethren many of them were <br/>
sick and were living upon bread alone and they wanted provisions <br/>
sent to them</p>

<p>Orders issued the next day for a number of waggons <br/>
to be fitted out and go with provisions to our brethren in the <br/>
Mountains. I was called upon for a horse team. Col Harman's <br/>
regiment was out this day with all their baggage waggons. They </p>",

<p>Baptisim and Confirmation of Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Edward Hunter]].</p>

<p>President Brigham Young then baptized Edward Hunter presiding<br/>
Bishop of the Church and confirmed him. President Young<br/>
was mouth and said:</p>

<p>Brother Edward Hunter we lay our hands<br/>
upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ and we confirm<br/>
you to be a<strike>n</strike> member in the Church of Jesus Christ of<br/>
Latter-day Saints and we seal upon you the gift of the Holy<br/>
Ghost and Priesthood and Bishoprick and the keys thereof<br/>
and we seal upon your head all the gifts blessings priesthood<br/>

[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] or any of the servants of God: and we say that you<br/>
shall have power to magnify your calling as the Chief Bishop<br/>
in the Church and Kingdom of God on earth. The Spirit<br/>
and power of the Holy Ghost and revelation shall rest upon<br/>
you in power and we seal you up unto Eternal Life and<br/>
we seal upon your head every blessing your heart can<br/>
desire in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.""</p>

<p>President Young then baptized<br/>
the following persons:</p>",
42829.0,239,,"<p>made quite a display</p>

<p>Elder [[Nathaniel V. Jones|Nathaniel V. Jones]] arrived on the morning of the 25 from <br/>
the United States Army with the express. He visited with Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van <br/>
Vleit]] both regiments. The first was the 10<sup>th</sup> Regiment. This was a <br/>
full regiment. The officers were young and full of fire and they swore they <br/>
would come in anyhow; they could whip out [[Utah Territory|Utah]]. Captain Van Vleit <br/>
advised them not to come for they could yet nothing and they would have <br/>
to fight their way; but they swore they would fight their way through <br/>
After Captain Van Vleit left them they marched 30 miles the next day.</p>

<p>The second regiment they met with were old officers<br/>
They considered it the matter over more and thought it an imposition to be sent out <br/>
here and as a political movement to killed innocent people or to get killed. They <br/>
were to be at the Pacific Springs that night and our brethren were to commence <br/>
operations upon them.</p>

<p>Next day I had some conversation with General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] upon <br/>
the subject of going into the Mountains. He said he should soon go <br/>
and talke with him [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] as Councillors<br/>
He was going to take but a part of his staff and he wished me to stay at <br/>
home in the [[Historian|Office]] for the present. This was according to counsel.</p>

<p>The following conversation passed between President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] and Captain Van Vleit not before recorded in this Journal. Captain <br/>
Van Vleit said I think that Congress will try to do all they can against you <br/>
President Young said if God inspires any man to speak for us it will be well <br/>
We have got to trust in God. If you will speak in favor of us and I <br/>
think you will the Lord will bless you for so doing. He will require it of <br/>
you. We have refuted lies so long that we have got tired of it and we <br/>
shall now trust in God for the future. Congress could send out an <br/>
investigating committee to [[Kansas|Kansas]] or to any other place but to Utah. Upon <br/>
the mere rumor of lies they could send out 2000 soldiers to Utah to destroy the <br/>
people without investigating the subject at all</p>

<p>Captain Van Vleit said the Government may yet send <br/>
out one to Utah and consider it policy before they get through with it</p>",
42829.0,147,,""">October the 4th 1856</time></p>

<p>On this day missionaries from Europe arrived home. They<br/>
arrived in the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]] at half past three oclock. The company<br/>
consisted of Franklin D. Richards [[Daniel Spencer|Daniel Spencer]] [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph A<br/>
Young]] [[William H. Kimball|William H. Kimball]] [[James Ferguson|James Ferguson]] [[George Davis Grant|George D.<br/>
Grant]] [[Nathaniel Henry Felt|N. H. Felt]] [[James R. McGaw|James M<sup>c</sup>Gaw]] [[John Van Cott|John Van Cott]]<br/>
[[Cyrus Hubbard Wheelock|C. H. Wheelock]] [[William C. Dunbar|Wm C Dunbar]] and [[John Daniel Thompson McAllister|John D. T. M<sup>c</sup>Allister]]<br/>
When Presidents [[Brigham Young|Young]] and Kimball met their sons and<br/>
friends with a hearty we<strike>a</strike>lcome the<strike>e</strike>re were tears of joy shed</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday and the day was<br/>
occupied by the returned Missionaries</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting President Brigham<br/>
Young went down into the Font and baptized men women and<br/>
children of his own family about 75 in number</p>

<p>Then President Heber C. Kimball went<br/>
down into the water and baptized about 75 mostly of his own<br/>
family but some were of my family and the families of<br/>
others of the Twelve and afterwards [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] went into<br/>
the water and baptized 25 persons making 175 souls all<br/>
of whom were confirmed under the hands of Heber C Kimb<strike>l</strike>all<br/>
J. M. Grant Wilford Woodruff and Joseph Young; but<br/>
a few of the last Daniel H. Wells and John Van Cott<br/>
assisted in confirming</p>

<p>In the meeting this day President Young</p>",
42829.0,240,,"<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said I do think that God has sent you out <br/>
here and that Good will grow out of it. I was glad when I learned that you <br/>
were coming.</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] replied I am very anxious to get back to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]<br/>
as soon as I can. I heard officially that General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] was recalled to <br/>
[[Kansas|Kansas]] to officiate as Governor. I shall stop the train on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] on <br/>
my own responsibility and leave them there.</p>

<p>President Young said if we can keep the peace for <br/>
this Winter I do think there will be something turn up that may save so much <br/>
shedding of blood. Captain Van Vleit observed I think so too. The <br/>
troops will have to stop on Hams Fork; for their provisions will be late coming <br/>
up. I do not think there is more than 1000 troops coming. There <br/>
is one regiment from the [[Florida|Florida]] war. There is not more than 300 men <br/>
They have been reduced by the scurvey. That Florida War has cost <br/>
many millions of money. It was a speculating scheme. There <br/>
are not more than 100 Indian Warriors and they have got hiding places <br/>
which no man can find. It is seldom you can kill one. You may <br/>
accidentally storm ball into one as you would a patridge. Well <br/>
this Florida regiment are old men and the regiment is worn out</p>

<p>Sunday the 27th I called upon Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] to get <br/>
the History of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] which he had written but he informed me we had left <br/>
it at the [[Historian|Historian's Office]] the evening before. He was preparing to go <br/>
into the Mountains with [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|D. H. Wells]] <br/>
and his staff or a part of it. They got ready and left the city about <br/>
1 o'clock P. M.</p>

<p>On Monday the 28th we received an express from our <br/>
army in the Moutains saying that our enemies were marching strongly <br/>
towards us. The brethren tried to stampeded the animals of the army <br/>
but they found them all chaned by the feet, so they could not run; a small <br/>
company of our brethren also tried to stampede some oxen and they failed <br/>
in it.</p>

<p>Brother [[Nathaniel V. Jones|Jones]] informed me that Captain Van Vleit <strike>told the army</strike> ^tried to^</p>",

the<br/>
Presidency: [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and<br/>

from the Presidency of the European mission</p>

<p>The other quorums of the Church were also numerously<br/>

and there was convened together a vast congregation</p>

said our Conference is now open and the first business is to<br/>

man them and start them <strike>back</strike> into the mountains<br/>
after the Handcart and other companies who are back on<br/>
the Plains. They were below [[Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]] some of them</p>

regiment swore that they had started for [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake]] and they would go there <br/>
The [[Stewart Van Vliet|Capt]]. told them we should not let them come in and they would find a <br/>
different warefare from anything they had met with</p>

<p>The [[Mountain Meadows, Washington County, Utah Territory|Mountain Meddow]] Massacre</p>

<p>On the 29th of September Elder [[John Doyle Lee|John D Lee]] arrived from [[Fort Harmony, Washington County, Utah Territory|Harmony]] with an express<br/>
and an Awful tale of blood. A company of Californian emigrants of about 150 <br/>
men women and children many of them belonging to the mobbers of [[Missouri|Missouri]] <br/>
and [[Illinois|Illinois]] had been massacred. They had many cattle and horses with <br/>
them <strike>a</strike>As they travelled along South they went damning [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
C Kimball]] and the heads of the Church saying that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] ought to have <br/>
been shot long before he was. They wanted to do all the evil they could <br/>
so they poisoned beef and gave it to the Indians and some of them died. They <br/>
poisoned the Springs of water and several of the Saints died. The Indians became <br/>
enraged at their conduct and they surrounded them on a Prairie and the emigrants <br/>
formed a bulwark of their waggons; but the Indians fought them five days <br/>
until they killed all their men about 60 in number. They then rushed into <br/>
the carrell and cut the throats of their woman and children except for some 8 or <br/>
10 children which they brought and sold to the whites</p>

<p>The Indians stripped the men and women naked <br/>
and left them stinking in the boiling sun. When brother Lee found it out <br/>
he took some men and went and buried their bodies. It was a horrid job<br/>
The whole air was filled with an awful stench. Many of the men and <br/>
women were rotten with the foul disease before they were hurt by the Indians<br/>
The Indians obtained all their property cattle horses and guns &amp;c</p>

<p>Their was another large company of emigrants who <br/>
had 1000 head of cattle who was also damning both Indians and Mormons<br/>
They were afraid of sharing the same fate. Brother Lee had to send <br/>
interpreters with them to the Indians to try to save their lives while at the <br/>
same time they were trying to kill us.</p>",

<p>President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] moved that President Young himself<br/>
and [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] should go into the mountains <strike>and</strike> to meet the<br/>
companies and bring them in. The vote was put to the people and<br/>
but few voted for it but the great majority against it</p>

<p>President Young spoke of the necessary of a<br/>
reformation among the people</p>

<p>President Kimball called upon the blacksmiths<br/>
in the congregation to return home to mend the wagons and<br/>
shoe the horses of the people so that they might start back<br/>
upon their expedition to help in the companies.</p>

<p>The authorities of the Church were then presented<br/>
by President Kimball and sustained</p>

<p>The 18th Ward was divided and [[John Sharp|John Sharp]]<br/>
was appointed Bishop to preside over the Twentieth Ward</p>

<p>Presidents Grant and Kimball addressed the<br/>
congregation and President Young then said</p>

<p>""I wish to fulfil the promise which I made<br/>
two weeks ago. I then told the people or the females that<br/>
I would release them at Conference. I will do so on certain<br/>
conditions and that is that you will appear forthwith at my<br/>
Office and give good and sufficient reasons and then marry<br/>
men who will not have but one wife.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the returned Elders [[Cyrus Hubbard Wheelock|Cyrus<br/>
H. W<strike>a</strike>heelock]] [[James Ferguson|James Ferguson]] [[William C. Dunbar|Wm C Dunbar]] Elder [[Edward Bunker|Bunker]]</p>",
42829.0,242,,"<p>We spent most of this day getting the brethren ready to go <br/>
into the Mountains.</p>

<p>Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] while speaking of the cutting of the throats of <br/>
women and children as the Indians had done South said that it was <br/>
heartrending that emigration must stop as he before said</p>

<p>Brother [[John Doyle Lee|Lee]] remarked that he did not think that <br/>
there was a drop of innocent blood in the camp of the emigrants who <br/>
were slain by the Indians. He had two of the surviving children <br/>
and he could get but one to kneel in prayer time and the other would <br/>
laugh at her for doing it and they would sware like pirates</p>

<p>An express came in at night saying that the troops were <br/>
near [[Fort Bridger, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bridger]] and had formed into three bodies in travelling. General <br/>
[[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] sent word for the brethren to let them come on to [[Echo Canyon, Summit County, Utah Territory|Ecko Kanyon]] <br/>
and there give them battle.</p>

<p>At 6 o'clock on the morning of the 30th the drums beat <br/>
and an army of soldiers paraded the streets some 400 who were in <br/>
readiness to march at a moments notice to the seat of war. We had at this <br/>
time about 800 men in the mountains. It was a solemn time the <br/>
armies of the Gentiles were making war upon us because of our religion and <br/>
we had to defend ourselves against a nation of 25,000,000 people and <br/>
the war had just commenced. We had to trust in God for the <br/>
result. We were resolved to do what we could and leave the work <br/>
in His hands. There was a solemnity resting upon our city <br/>
this morning; all were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the express<br/>
I told President Young that I was on hand at any moment to go into <br/>
the mountains when he would say the word. I went up in the <br/>
evening to the [[President|President's Office]] and learned that the [[California|California]] mail <br/>
had arrived. I heard some letters read, one stating that the Government<br/>
had made arrangements to sent up light drauht boats up the <br/>
[[Colorado River, United States|Colorado river]] with men and arms against us from that point</p>

<p>Next morning October the 1st I arose early <br/>
and looked for an express signal flag but saw none. There </p>",
42829.0,150,,""">7th</time> Conference was called to order by<br/>
President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] who rebuked those who were in the habit<br/>
of leaving during service or talking at meeting and he said</p>

<p>""You may say I am severe. I am not<br/>
half as severe as the Lord wants me to be. I have seen<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] when men were in Council meetings with him and<br/>
rose to leave cut them off from the Church before they got<br/>
out of the door. You tramel the Spirit and it is grieved<br/>
with the confusion and interuption. If you do not believe<br/>
this get the Spirit of God and come on this stand and<br/>
attempt to talk to the people</p>

<p>During the day a number of the<br/>
Returned Missionaries spoke and it was resolved that<br/>
the Returned Missionaries should stay with their families</p>",
42829.0,243,,"<p>was a good deal of anxity through the day waiting for an express</p>

<p>In the latter part of the day I called at the [[President|President's <br/>
Office]] and found President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] [[Albert Carrington|Albert Carrington]] <br/>
[[George Davis Grant|George D. Grant]] and [[William H. Kimball|William Kimball]] and an Express arrived from Col [[Jesse Carter Little|Little]] <br/>
giving an account of the number of soldiers which were with him and about [[Echo Canyon, Summit County, Utah Territory|Echo <br/>
Kanyon]]. As soon as we had got through reading his letter an express<br/>
arrived from General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|D. H. Wells]] [[John Taylor, b. 1808|J. Taylor]] and [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] sent by [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph<br/>
A Young]] and <strike>Joseph</strike> [[James Willard Cummings|^James W.^ Cummings]] saying that they had sent an express to the<br/>
United States army containing Governor Young's orders for them to surrender<br/>
all their arms and baggage to [[Lewis Robison|Lewis Robinson]] Quarter Master General<br/>
at [[Fort Bridger, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Bridger]] or to retreat back to the States or we should resist them<br/>
The U.S. army was encamped on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Ham's Fork]]. The Brethren were<br/>
waiting an answer to their message and would send an express in as<br/>
soon as they got it.</p>

<p>I expect the 5th in the President's Office. He heard a part of the account of the death of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] by John Taylor. He said what<br/>
there was necessary to put into Joseph's History and the rest to go as John<br/>
Taylor's History.</p>

<p>General Conference<br/>
October th[e] 6th</p>

<p>Our Conference this year of course was very materially thrown out of<br/>
its amout of business and importance by the circumstances of the war<br/>
against the Saints and the number of our brethren in the Mountains to<br/>
defend our cause our people and our homes. The Conference lasted <br/>
two days and then closed. The time was mostly occupied by the <br/>
Missionaries and the Twelve and President Young spoke at the close<br/>
of the meetings of the Conference</p>

<p>[[Lot Smith|Lot Smith]] Burns U.S. Waggons</p>

<p>On the 8th we got an express saying that a company under<br/>
Lot Smith had burned up 50 of the Government waggons and </p>",
42829.0,244,,"<p>while they were burning General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] and his cavalry came up. [[Lot Smith|Lot Smith's]] <br/>
company had gone East to burn up what they could. It was thought <br/>
that there would be decided action soon</p>

<p>On the 13th the brethren came in from the East and <br/>
brought in 153 head of cattle. Three teamsters and one deserter from <br/>
the army helped to drive them in. The deserter reported that <br/>
neither [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] Harney nor the Governor <strike>or</strike> Judges nor any of the Territorial <br/>
officers had arrived at the army nor any females. He said the <br/>
soldiers were only allowed 3 buiscuts 2 cups of coffee and a small piece <br/>
of beef per day and that they were not half fed. He said they had <br/>
75 waggons burned and the contents of 76. Two waggons were <br/>
saved. Captain Lot Smith saved all the private property of the<br/>
teamsters and when the waggons were burned they gave back the <br/>
teamsters all their arms ammunition &amp;c. Our brother had his knee <br/>
shattered by the accidental discharge of a yawger. They had <br/>
to carry him on a litter a long distance. He suffered much <br/>
with it.</p>

<p>The [[Sanpete County, Utah Territory|Sanpete]] company arrived in the city on the <strike>12</strike>^14^th <br/>
comprising 100 men and 11 baggage waggons. They marched five <br/>
men abreast. Col [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] informed ^me^ that there were 1100 men <br/>
of our soldiers in the Mountains and 700 camped on the Public Square <br/>
and that we could raise 1500 men in this city: In 15 hours we could <br/>
place 3000 armed men in [[Echo Canyon, Summit County, Utah Territory|Echo Kanyon]]</p>

<p>An express arrived at 25 minuted to 6 o'clock <br/>
brought by Brother [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph A Young]] <strike>Jr</strike>. [[Benjamin Joseph Stringham|Benjamen Stringham]] <br/>
brought a letter from General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] stating that numbers of the U.S.<br/>
Army wished to desert and come into the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] if they had protection <br/>
The army was weakening daily. The chief officers sent a very polite <br/>
note to Governor [[Brigham Young|Young]] acknowledging the receipt of the Deseret News <br/>
which he had sent them.</p>

<p>Captain [[Lot Smith|Lot Smith]] had gone East upon his <br/>
mission in watching for the interest of Utah. The enemy</p>",
42829.0,245,,""">Oct 16th</time></p>

<p>An express arrived this morning bringing a letter from Col Alexander <br/>
to Governor Young concerning the present state of affairs also a letter <br/>
from General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]]</p>

<p>The brethren had taken a herd of cattle of 700 head and <br/>
were bringing them in. It was reported in the army that Col. [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] <br/>
would soon be up with 700 cavalry but this was uncertain</p>

<p>Col Alexander's letter was rather severe and <br/>
threatened us with extermination if we opposed. He considered himself <br/>
able to come in and carry out the commands of the Government.<br/>
Governor Young sent him a strong answer asking him why he stayed <br/>
in camp on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] for a month if he considered he had force <br/>
enough to carry out his orders. He gave him to understand that it <br/>
was now the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of the Devil and we <br/>
trusted in God for success and should go ahead</p>

<p>In turning from this subject to little children President <br/>
Young said when some people have little children born at 6 or seven months <br/>
from pregnancy and they live a few hours and then die they bless them <br/>
name them &amp;c but I dont do it for I think that such a spirit will have <br/>
a chance of occupying another Tabernacle and develop^ing^ itself. This is <br/>
new doctrine, yet it looks consistant. What period of demarcation <br/>
or age the Spirit would take another body we were not informed.</p>

<p>Sunday the 18th we met in the [[Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] and heard <br/>
The Correspondence of Col Alexander to Governor Young</p>",
42829.0,246,,"<p>The correspondence was very rich and edifying. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] then <br/>
preached to the assembly in a very profitable manner. He said he <br/>
should prepare for the wors<strike>e</strike>t and should have grain cached where the <br/>
enemy could not find it and be prepared to move into the mountains and <br/>
burn all. Yet he believed we could keep our enemies out and still raise <br/>
crops in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]]. He was followed by brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] who said <br/>
that he knew that if we would hearken to counsel that we should raise <br/>
grain eat peaches and apples and live in our houses in the Valleys <br/>
until we went to [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson Countay]]. President Young said I believe it</p>

<p>An Express arrived at 1 P. M of the 18th and <br/>
brought a letter to President Young from [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]] and one to me <br/>
from [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]]. They informed us of an</p>

<p>An Adventure of Captain [[Lot Smith|Lot Smith]]</p>

<p>who with his company came near being caught in a trap by the enemy in <br/>
the following manner. About daybreak they came near the enemy's <br/>
camp and thought they saw a drove of mules a distance from the camp<br/>
They made a charge upon them to stampede them but as they rushed <br/>
in among them they found they were mounted dragoons. The <br/>
captain of the company sulated and said Captain Smith you cannot <br/>
see very good this morning. Captain Smith replied I can see as <br/>
well as you can with your blind bridles on. They looked at each <br/>
other awhile then Lot Smith trotted off at a slow pace but the enemy <br/>
tried to sworound them and they had to gallop over a very rough place <br/>
to get away. When they got about 30 rods away the enemy dismounted <br/>
and took a dead rest and shot about 30 bullets at them. One ball passed <br/>
through one of the brethren's hat and another ball grazed a horse's leg <br/>
That was all the damage which was done. This was the first <br/>
firing on either side and this was done by our enemies; but no <br/>
blood was shed except it was the blood of a horse's leg.</p>

<p>Col. [[Robert Taylor Burton|Burton]] with a company of dragoons or </p>",
42829.0,247,,"<p>minute men arrived in this city in good health and spirits. President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] <br/>
addressed them a short time and said by virtue of the office which I hold I <br/>
bless you in the name of the Lord and if you will live your religion and do right <br/>
you shall none of you fall by the hand of an enemy but you shall eat peaches <br/>
and apples in this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] until you go to [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] Missouri and your enemies <br/>
shall not conquer you. Keep your guns and firelocks in good order and do not <br/>
waste your ammunition for naught. It is not a day for much preaching <br/>
but a day for hard service. This is not much that we have to meet with this <br/>
fall but next year we must be prepared for work. General [[George Davis Grant|Grant]] followed <br/>
with few words and told them where to go for quarters and they went to their <br/>
various places allotted them</p>

<p>October the 21st brother [[Dan Atwood|Atwood]] arrived in the morning <br/>
bringing an express from General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] and 2 letters from Col [[Edmund Brooke Alexander|Alexander]] <br/>
who closed his letter by saying that ""he should not obey the Governor's orders <br/>
and his final disposal of the troops would depend upon grave considerations <br/>
which I do not deem necessary to enumerate.""</p>

<p>The messenger said that the 5th regiment had <br/>
stopped near [[Bear River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bear River]] in tents and the 10th regiment had moved <br/>
back on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] five miles with all their teams and baggage<br/>
The were in the snow several inches deep. The brethren travelled <br/>
several miles with the army. The men were so weak and cold <br/>
they would wrap up in their coats and lie down in the snow to rest <br/>
almost every mile.</p>

<p>We could not tell what the intentions of the officers <br/>
were. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] was of an opinion that Col Alexanders <br/>
intention was to come nearer our camp so that his men might desert <br/>
Col. [[Robert Taylor Burton|Robert Burton]] said that it was 80 miles from Alexander's <br/>
command to the mouth of [[Echo Canyon, Summit County, Utah Territory|Echo Kanyon]]. President Yound said ""here <br/>
are the officers around me and I will call a council of war. He then <br/>
said:</p>

<p>""I think it is best for General Wells to call in all his forces to <br/>
Echo Kanyon and there rest and not ride his horses to death unnecessarily</p>",
42829.0,248,,"<p>but let the enemy alone now and they will soon use themselves up. Keep <br/>
a few to watch their movements and let them work and they will <br/>
soon all be used up.</p>

<p>Dr [[George Washington Hickman|Hickman]] was with the 5th regiment and <br/>
Allen and his companions with the 10th regiment. [[Heber Parley Kimball|Heber <strike>C.</strike> Kimball<br/>
Jr]] sent Col [[Edmund Brooke Alexander|Alexander]] a doz onions and the Col said that if he <br/>
had anything that Heber wanted he would send it to him. He <br/>
asked Beaty why he tryed to stampede their animals and burn <br/>
the grass. He said ""we burn the grass to get a better crop next <br/>
year.</p>

<p>On this day the 21st some 700 or 800 head of cattle were drove <br/>
into the city taken from the U.S. Army. They were accompanied <br/>
by some teamsters and soldiers who looked poor and hungry.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Youngs]] Veiws of the Way to Conquer the Saints</p>

<p>In conversation on the 24th upon the events of the time President <br/>
Young said he was satisfied that we could live in this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] and <br/>
raise crops and keep our enemies out. It is not in their power to <br/>
overthrow us. By the help of God we can remain here and they cannot <br/>
conquer us. I have reflected this over in my mind to see what <br/>
way I could conquer this people if I was there; and I cannot see but one <br/>
way and that way they will not attempt to take. The United States <br/>
have spent three millions of dollars this season to fit out an army to destroy <br/>
us and it has done us no harm. But if I was going to attempt <br/>
to destroy this people I should have let them have their Post Office made <br/>
one million dollars of appropriation given them all they asked for then spent <br/>
another million in carrying in Gentiles and merchandize and kept this up <br/>
yearly until I had filled the country with Gentiles but the Lord would <br/>
not let them do this. I should know I could not conquer them <br/>
by force and they will find it out</p>

<p>President Young got a letter to-day from Gen [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] <br/>
who said the enemy have returned back on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Ham's Fork]] some 15 miles</p>",
42829.0,249,,"<p>On the 25th Elders [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] arrived from the <br/>
head quarters of the army and met in council with us. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] upon <br/>
the subject of the war said I mean to send word to the United States that if they <br/>
have sent troops here the cattle which we have taken I will give them credit for upon <br/>
compound interest but I do not know that they have sent any. They have not <br/>
notified me officially and I have not right to know anything about it but shall <br/>
treat them as a mob</p>

<p>On the 26th Brother [[Peter Wilson Conover|Peter ^W^ Conover]] and [[Oliver Smith|Oliver Smith]] arrived and <br/>
called upon President Young with news from our [[Carson Valley, Utah Territory|Carson Valley]] company <br/>
The Carson Valley Saints and those from [[California|California]] and [[Oregon Territory|Oregon]] were on their <br/>
way to this [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|City]]. They had 160 fighting men with 2700 <u>lbs</u> of <br/>
ammunition belonging to the Church with a great deal of private property<br/>
and a large amount of arms. All the Saints were coming from Carson <br/>
Valley. They left only 2 boxes of caps and 1 <u>lb</u> of powder in all Carson <br/>
Valley. The people sold all their arms and ammunition to the brethren <br/>
for their places</p>

<p>President Young received a letter from General [[George Davis Grant|Grant]]. The U. S. <br/>
army were still on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] and had not decided which route they would <br/>
take. Our brethren had got the chief waggon master in custody</p>

<p>The Presidency and Twelve were in conversation all the <br/>
forenoon at his [[President|office]] on the subject of the war. President Young said <br/>
that the United States Government were loosing their national greatness, <br/>
and wisdom was departing from them. We need not ^have^ as much <strike>need</strike><br/>
<strike>to</strike> fear of them as we should of an army of grasshoppers. If they take <br/>
away our charter from us and divide our territory it will be unconstitutional <br/>
as everything is which they do against us. I told brother [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]]<br/>
that if they took away our Charter to come immediately home as soon <br/>
as he could and we would organize our State Government and <br/>
fall back upon our original boundaries. Our East boundary should <br/>
be as far as [[Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]] and our West boundary the summit of the <br/>
[[Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, United States|Siere Nevada]] and run to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific Ocean]] and we would <br/>
defend it. The United States may do as they please. We will</p>",
42829.0,250,,"<p>do as the Lord wants us.</p>

<p>One young officer of the army said that old Jesus Christ <br/>
could not keep him out of[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory| Salt Lake City]] but they will find out who rules on <br/>
earth and in the heavens. Another officer said the United States <br/>
would wipe us out another year. Should they send an army of 20,000 men <br/>
it would take more than 20 miles for their army and train to move<br/>
at all and the more there is of them the worse off they will be.</p>

<p>Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] said will not the army go into <br/>
[[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarter]] and entrench themselves and remain until they get help <br/>
from the States? President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said if an army comes to help <br/>
them in the Spring we will use <strike>them</strike> up this army first and then we will<br/>
us up the other before they get to the South Pass. In the Spring we <br/>
must ask [[Edmund Brooke Alexander|Alexander]] what he intends to do inform him that he must <br/>
not stay there until he gets reinforcements in the Spring and if they will not <br/>
leave in the Spring we will use them up as best we can in ten days. We <br/>
can put two thousand men around them who <strike>c</strike>would soon use them <br/>
up. I do not believe they will have 500 fighting men in the <br/>
Spring. They are in a very critical situation. I think it is <br/>
better to let them alone this Winter. They will die many of them <br/>
and others desert and many be weakened with the scurvey and in the <br/>
Spring we will wipe them out if necesary if they dont go away. <br/>
We do all our business in the name of Israel's God and they in <br/>
their own way. The whole matter can be sumed up in these <br/>
few words. We are here at home by our own fireseide while they are <br/>
a great way from home. I intend to send those teamsters to the <br/>
South where they cannot get back to the army.</p>

<p>By express on the 20th we learned that <br/>
the enemy had not moved for several days but were writing <br/>
for Col [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] to come up with four companies of cavalry and <br/>
two companies of infantry. This however was but from report <br/>
and not authority</p>

<p>It was decided in Council that General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] John Taylor</p>",

My parentage, Birth, (<strike>The</strike> The misfortunes which befel me in early life,) And occupation. My Fathers family</p>

<p>I Willford Woodruff was the son of [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]], who was the son of Capt [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad Woodruff]], who was the son of<br/>
[[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Woodruff]]. My Mother [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Bulah Thompson]] was the daughter of [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot Thompson]] All of which were born in the town<br/>
of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Hartford Co, Connecticut. My Fathers family consisted of eight sons &amp; one daughter <u>viz</u> [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] <br/>

but four of us among the living.</p>

<p>My life commenced with the spring. I was born in the North part of the <br/>
town of Farmington, now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], March 1<sup><u>st</u></sup> 1807. Tho occupation of my Father was a miller from his youth up<br/>
which occupation I followed untill AD 1831. Variant <s>&amp;</s>and divers are the lives &amp; fortunes of men in evry age of the<br/>
world, while the path of some are strewed with flowers &amp; ease from the cradle to the grave, with naught to disturd their<br/>
peace, others Apparrently are marked victims, of variated misfortunes, accident &amp; dangers, the last named class is<br/>
the one in whose ranks I have stood through my infancy, childhood, youth &amp; manhood nearly to the present time<br/>
so much so that it has seemed at times as though some invisible power or fate was watching my footsteps in order<br/>
to find some opportunity to take my life from the earth, But I can ownly attribut the continuation of my life on earth to the<br/>
present time to a merciful Providence whose hand has ben stretched out &amp; rescued me from death in the midst of the<br/>
many dangers &amp; hair bredths escapes which I have passed through in life, some of which I will here mention. When three years<br/>
of age, I fell into a caldron of scalding water, was instantly caught out, <s>&amp;</s>and so badly scalded, that it was <strike>nine</strike> nine months<br/>
before the[y] considerd me out of danger <strike>of the effects of the accident.</strike> My fifth &amp; sixth years was interwoven with many acci-<br/>
dents. On a certain day in company with my elder Brothers I entered the Barn &amp; chose the top of a hay mow for a place<br/>
of diversion. We had not been there long before I fell from the great beam upon my face upon the bear floor, which ended<br/>
our sport for that day at least, however I shortly recoverd from the fall &amp; a few weeks afterwords was again to play<br/>
in the chamber of my Fathers House on Sunday with my Brothers Azmon &amp; Thompson, and father reproved us for so<br/>
doing, but we were so busy we could not spend time to obey our fathers ^command^ <strike>advise</strike>, And whether we disturded him or<br/>
whether he thought of [[Solomon (OT)|Solomons]] advise I know not but at all events he spared not the rod of correction, and began<br/>
to flog us. we started to go below, &amp; as we came to the stairs I was behind &amp; hence the blows fell on me and while making<br/>
an effort to get before my brothers I made a misstep &amp; fell to the bottom of the stairs &amp; broke one of my arms in the fall, <br/>
so much for disobediance. It was not long before I recoverd from this misfortune &amp; was about the streets again<br/>
It was but a short time before I narrowly escaped with my life. My father owned a stock of horned cattle</p>",
42828.0,12,,"<p>And among them was one cow which I called mine, one evening I accompanied my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] to the barn, <br/>
to fodder them. It being in the fall of the year we were feeding out pumpkins and among our stock<br/>
Father had a large surley Bull, &amp; while distributing the pum<s>k</s>pkins my cow got one &amp; the Bull another, soon<br/>
the Bull came &amp; got the one my cow had. I then went &amp; got the one the Bull left, to give my cow No sooner<br/>
had I got it in my arms, than the Bull left his &amp; came after me, I ran down a hill with all my might &amp; <br/>
the Bull at my heels my Father seeing my danger told me to throw down the pum^p^kin but feeling anxious<br/>
to see that my cow should have her right I still held on. Bu<s>ll</s>t while the Bull was approaching me with<br/>
the fierceness of a tiger I made a miss step fell flat upon the ground, the pumpkin rolled out of my arms<br/>
the Bull leaped over me run his horns into the pumpkin &amp; tore it to peaces &amp; probably would have<br/>
done the same by me had I not have fallen which escape like many others I attribute to the mercy &amp; goodness<br/>
of GOD. It was during the same year that I was again under the necessary of employing a physician<br/>
while paying a visit at my Uncle [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1773|Eldad Woodruff]] I was standing in a porch with one arm around a<br/>
pillar leaning over the railing my arm sliped off the pillar &amp; I fell several feet across some timber &amp;<br/>
broke my other arm. One would naturly suppose by this time that I should begin to grow caucious<br/>
in my procedings. But not many months rolled around defore I was called to endure still heavier<br/>
fate. My father owned a lumber sawmill in addition to his flowering mill, and one morning in<br/>
company with several other boys I went into the saw mill &amp; got onto the head Block of the carriage<br/>
to ride not anticipating any danger but before I was awere of it my leg was caught between the<br/>
head block &amp; fender post &amp; broaken short into, I was taken to the house &amp; lay nine hours before my bones<br/>
wer replased which time was spent amid severe pain, but being young my bones soon nit together<br/>
&amp; in few weeks I was again upon my feet as usual attending to the sport <strike>&amp;</strike> of my youth. <br/>
During my confinement with this lameness, my Brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] <strike>was</strike> was my companion going<br/>
through a course of the tipus fever. Thus one scene of accident after another followed me through<br/>
my youth from <s>y</s>month to month &amp; year to year. I had occasion one dark evening to cross my fathers<br/>
meadow while doing so I run against an ox that was feeding the ox not knowing what it was concluded<br/>
to defend himself with his heels, he kicked me in the bowels but I being so near him I was rather more frightened<br/>
than hurt. Again my uncle had a load of hay to get in and for the want of help proposed for me to load<br/>
it. Although I was young I agreed to make the trial, &amp; with his assistance I thought it loaded vary well but<br/>
befor he reached the barn he drove over a large stone &amp; turned most of the hay over I fell onto the ground<br/>
&amp; the load top of me. But an exertion was made &amp; the hay removed from me as soon as possible &amp; I<br/>
once more breathed a free element. While 8 years of age I accompanied my father with several others<br/>
in a one horse waggon about three miles from home to attend to some work, while on the way the horses decame<br/>
frightend ran dow a hill &amp; turned the waggon over with us in it But again while in danger I was saved<br/>
by the hand of providence none of us was injured. While in the days of my youth I cl<strike>u</strike>imb^ed^ an elm tree<br/>
to procure some bark &amp; while about fifteen feet from the ground the limb deing dry upon which<br/>
I stood it broke &amp; I fell to the ground upon my bacck<s>s</s> which apparrently beat the breath out of<br/>
my body A cousin that was with me ran to the house &amp; told my parents that I was dead, but <br/>
before my freinds got to me I had revived rose upon my feet &amp; met them on the way<br/>
At Twelve years of Age I was drowned in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington River]] &amp; sunk in 30 feet<br/>
of water and was almost mirac<s>l</s>ulously saved by a young man named [[John Bacon|Bacon]] I suffered<br/>
much in being restored to life. At Thirteen years of age while passing through [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]</p>",
42828.0,13,,"<p>meadows in the debth of winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an exceding<br/>
blustering day I became so chilled and overcome with the cold that I could not travel I cra<s>l</s>wled<br/>
into the hallow of a large Apple tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into it hastened to me<br/>
realizing more fully than I did the danger I was in. when he arived at the spot I had fallen asleep,<br/>
&amp; was nearly insensible he had much difficulty in arousing me to a sens of my situation. he procu-<br/>
red means to convey me to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] House and through a kind Providence my life was again pres[er]ved.</p>

<p>At Fourteen years of Age I split my left instep open with an Ax which went nearly through my foot<br/>
it was about nine months getting well. I suffered much with it.</p>

<p>At Fifteen years of age I was bit in the hand with a mad dog in the last stage of the hydrophobia<br/>
but he ownly dented my hand with his Teeth but did not draw blood &amp; I was again preserved through<br/>
the [[mercy of God|mercy of God]] from an awful death</p>

<p>At the age of seventeen I met with an accident which caused me much suffering &amp; came near<br/>
Ending my life I was riding very ill tempered horse whose temper &amp; practices I was igno-<br/>
rant of and while going down a vary steep rocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground<br/>
instantly leaped from the road &amp; ran down the steepest part of the Hill amid the thickest of the rocks at<br/>
full speed and he commenced kicking up at the same time &amp; was about landing me over his head am[o]ng<br/>
the rocks but I lodged on the top of his head &amp; grasp one hand hold of each ear as with a death<br/>
grasp, expecting evry moment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks, while in this position seting<br/>
Astride his neck with no bridle to guide him but his ears, he plunged down the hill among the rocks<br/>
with all fury untill he struck a rock near breast high, which dashed him to the earth. I went over<br/>
his head about one rod and struck the ground square upon my feet being the ownly thing that saved<br/>
my life: for had I sruck the ground on any other part of my body it must have killed me instatly.<br/>
as it was my bones crushed from under me as though they were reeds. I broke <strike>two</strike>one ^one^ of my legs<br/>
<strike>&amp; one</strike> twice in two &amp; put out both of my ancles in a shocking manner. And the horse came nigh<br/>
rolling over me afterwards in his struggles. An [[Titus Woodruff|Uncle]] of mine saw me fall &amp; hastened to my<br/>
relief, &amp; got assistance &amp; carried me to his house in an arm chair. I lay from 2 oclok in the Afternoon<br/>
till 10 at night without aids then my Father arived bringing with him Dr. [[Dr. Swift|Swift]] of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]<br/>
who set my bones boxed up my limbs &amp; carryed me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my Fathers<br/>
house my sufferings were vary great; yet I had good attendance &amp; in 8 weeks was outdoors<br/>
upon my crutches, &amp; soon was well again.</p>

<p>In A.D. 1827 while I was tending a flouring mill for Aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Wheeler]] in [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] Ct. I was<br/>
standing upon one of the wheels clearing the ice off A man hoisted the gate &amp; let a full head of water<br/>
upon the wheel which instantly started as the water struck it at the same instant my feet sliped into the wheel<br/>
wheel. I immediately plunged head foremost over the rim of the wheel into about 3 feet of water &amp; my weight drew<br/>
my legs out of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft &amp; crushed to death</p>

<p>In AD 1831 while having charge of the flouring Mill at [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsvill]] Ct. I was standing inside<br/>
of a Breast wheel 20 feet in diameter upon one of the Arms near the top clearing the ice out of it when<br/>
A full head of water was let onto it it immediately started I droped my ax and leaped to the bottom<br/>
of the wheel by the shaft &amp; arms near 20 feet. As I struck the bottom of the wheel I was rolled<br/>
out against a ragged stone wall with ownly two feet clearance between it &amp; ^the^ wheel the wheel caught<br/>
me and rolled me out into the water below whare I found myself without any broaken bones<br/>
but with some bruises and much fright</p>",
42828.0,14,,""">15<sup>th</sup> day of October 1846</time> while with the [[Camp of Israel|Camp of Israel]] building up [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]]<br/>
on the west side of [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] then Indian Country, I passed through one of the most painful<br/>
&amp; serious misfortunes of any of my lif<s>if</s>e.  I took my Ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the Bluffs to cut<br/>
some shingle timber to cover my cabins. I was accompanied by two other men and while falling the third<br/>
tree I steped back of it some 8 feet whare I thought I was entirely out of Danger but when the tree<br/>
fell their was a <strike>ko</strike>crook in the tree which struck a knowl and shot and ways back of the stump and <br/>
bounded &amp; the but of the tree struck me in the breast &amp; knocked me several feet in the air against<br/>
a standing Oak and the falling tree followed me in its bound &amp; caught me against the standing tree and<br/>
I came down between the two trees one falling &amp; the other standing but before reaching the ground I was<br/>
cleared from between them &amp; struct upon my feet it badly bruised my ^left^ thigh the whole length of it<br/>
&amp; my hip. Also my left arm It also broke my breast bone into &amp; 3 ribs on my left side it also bruised my<br/>
lungs vitals &amp; left side in a shocking manner. After the accident I sat upon a log untill Mr [[John Garrison|John Garrison]]<br/>
went a quarter of a mile &amp; got my horse, notwithstanding <strike>w</strike>I was so badly hurt I had to mount my hourse<br/>
&amp; ride two &amp; a half miles over an exceding rough road &amp; had to dismount twice in consequence of mirey<br/>
places my breast &amp; vitals was so badly torn to peaces that each step of the horse went through me like an<br/>
arrow I continued on hors<strike>e</strike>back untill I arived at [[Turkey Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turkey Creek]] on the North Side of Winter quarters<br/>
I then became exhausted &amp; was taken off &amp; carried in a chair to my house I was met in <strike>a</strike> th<s>e</s>e street<br/>
by Presidents [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] ^&amp; others^ who assisted in carrying me to my waggon<br/>
&amp; family before laying me upon my bed they [[laying on of hands|laid hands]] upon me &amp; rebuked my pain &amp; distress in</p>",
42828.0,15,,"<p>the name of the Lord &amp; said I should live and not die I was then laid upon my bed in my waggon<br/>
as my cabbin was not done, &amp; as the Apostles prophesied upon my head so it came to pass I did live<br/>
&amp; not die I employed no physician on this occasion but was [[priesthood blessing|administered]] to by the [[Elders of Israel|Elders of Israel]] and nursed<br/>
by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]. I lay upon my bed unabled to move untill my breast bone began to knit together which commenced on the <br/>
9<sup><u>th</u></sup> day I began to walk about in 20 days and in 30 days from the time I was hurt I again commenced hard labour<br/>
And it has always appeared mir<strike>r</strike>aculous to me that with all the injuries &amp; broaken bones that I have had that<br/>
I now have not a lame limb about, <strike>but</strike> me, but have been enabled ever since to endure the hardest man-<br/>
uel labour, exposures, hardship &amp; Journ<s>e</s>ies, have even walked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles in<br/>
a day, however if I overlabour or take a severe cold I feel it more sensibly in my breast &amp; left side than<br/>
I did before my last injury. Thus I have occupied considerable space in refering to those peculiar circumstances<br/>
which have attended me during life and to sum the matter up it stands about thus, I have broaken both<br/>
legs (one twice in two) both Arms, both Ancles, my breast bone &amp; three ribs, have been drowned, froze, &amp; scalded,<br/>
have been in two water<s>h</s>wheels while turning under a full head of water &amp; have passed through a score of other<br/>
hair breadths esscape yet the mercies of God have been over me, &amp; my life has thus far been preserved on<br/>
the Earth For which blessing I feel to render the gratitude of my heart with thanksgiving to my [[Heavenly Father|Heavenly <br/>
Father]] praying that the remainder of my days may be spent in his service &amp; the building up of his Kingdom</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>My experience and Reflections upon religious subjects previous to hearing &amp; embracing the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness]] of the<br/>
[[everlasting gospel|everlasting gospel]] as tought &amp; practiced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints</p>

<p>At an early age my mind from time to time began to be exercised upon religious subjects<br/>
but I never made a profession of religion untill AD 1830 being 23 years of age. I did not then <br/>
Join any church for the reason that I could not find any body of People, denomination, or church<br/>
who had for their foundation, doctrines, tenets, faith, &amp; practices: that gospel, faith, principles, practices<br/>
ordinances, gifts and foundation which the Ancient Apostles Prophets &amp; Saints Taught, enjoyed and<br/>
held forth as the gospel of Jesus Christ with the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] and its attendant gifts and graces. And whenever<br/>
I conversed with ministers of the various denominations or se<strike>x</strike>cts they would universally tell me that prophets,<br/>
Apostles, Revelations, [[healing the sick|Healing the sick]] &amp;c were given to esstablish Jesus Christ &amp; his doctrin &amp; have ever since been<br/>
done away and no longer needed in the church &amp; [[kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]]. This Argument I could not, nor<strike>,</strike> never<br/>
did believe. But I did believe that Revelation, the gifts, graces, &amp; faith once deliverd to the saints which they<br/>
have enjoyed in all former Ages when God has ha<strike>s</strike>d an acknowledged people on Earth has been done<br/>
away ownly through the disobedience and unbelief of the children of man I believed evry gift Office and<br/>
blessing just as necessary to constitute a true church of Christ and Kingdom of God in our day &amp; gener-<br/>
ation as in any age of the world. This principle &amp; belief was firmly rivited upon my mind from two<br/>
causes, first from the perusal of the bible whare I found cause and effect alike in all past ages and the same<br/>
promised in all generations to come. At the same time I could not find any change of the gospel or the [[plan of salvation|plan<br/>
of salvation]] in the days of Christ &amp; the Apostles or that their would be any change in the ordinances of the<br/>
gospel or plan of saving men in the last days. I learned from the scriptures that many of the Ancient<br/>
Prophets, &amp; Christ and the Apostles, did foresee by Inspiration &amp; Revelation and did prophesy that the Gentile<br/>
Nations as the Jews had done <strike>would</strike> would Apostatize &amp; turn away from the true faith and church and</p>",
42828.0,16,,"<p>[[kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] that thare would be a [[falling away|falling away]] from Apostolic faith Doctrins and ordinances<br/>
and that other systems would arise in its stead, and when these fals systems had arived at their<br/>
fullness than would ""the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom which should become an Everlasting Kingdom<br/>
to whose dominion should be no end."" 'Then should this gospel of the Kingdom be preached in all<br/>
the world as a witness unto all Nations before the End should come"" Then should the church come<br/>
up out of the wilderness and be esstablished upon the foundation of the Ancient Apostles &amp; Prophets<br/>
Christ Jesus being the [[chief cornerstone|chief corner stone]]. Also that the same gospel and Kingdom of God with<br/>
all its attendant blessings &amp; promises that was taken from the Jews (who had fallen through unbelief)<br/>
and given to the gentiles who brought forth the fruits of that Kingdom for a season but when they<br/>
fell away in like manners through the same example of unbelief Then the gospel &amp; Kingdom of God<br/>
will be taken out of the hands of the Gentiles as Nations and again be restored to the Jews with all the<br/>
[[House of Israel|House of Israel]] And that when this gospel &amp; Kingdom was restored to the Jews it would possess<br/>
all the powers gifts blessing &amp; ordances which it did possess when it was taken from them.</p>

<p>These things I did learn from the perusal of the scriptures which made a lasting impression upon my<br/>
mind. Another cause for these principles being planted in my mind was I was taught in the <br/>
days of my youth by an aged man by the name of [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]] who lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|S<s>y</s>imsbury]] C.t.<br/>
He was called by many a Prophet and many of his prophesies have since come to pass to my<br/>
certain knowledge. through fasting, prayer, &amp; the [[laying on of hands|laying on of hands]] in the name of Jesus Christ the<br/>
sick were healed, and devils were cast out under his A<strike>c</strike>dministration, even his own son who had<br/>
become a raving maniac after praying &amp; fasting for <u>nine</u> days in his behalf He arose from his bed on<br/>
the ninth day &amp; rebuked the ^evil spirit^ <strike>devil</strike> &amp; commanded the devil to come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ<br/>
and it instantly obeyed him &amp; he was made whole from that hour. This man instilled those principles<br/>
into my mind also into the mind of my Elder Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon Woodruff]] ^and Many others^. He did not believe the church<br/>
&amp; Kingdom of God in its organized form was among man on the Earth. He considerd that he had no<br/>
authority to administer in any of the ord<strike>a</strike>inances of the Gospel and knew of No man that had, but<br/>
believed it his privilege or the privilege of any man who had faith in God to fast and pray for the<br/>
sick by the laying on off hands, and to pray for light knowledge truth visions &amp; revelations. He told me<br/>
the day was nigh<s>t</s> when the Lord would again esstablish his church and Kingdom on the Earth with<br/>
all the gifts &amp; graces that were manifest in the days of the Savior. He said it would commence upon the<br/>
Earth before he died but <strike>it</strike>he would not live to enjoy &amp; partake of its blessings but said that<br/>
I should &amp; that I should become a conspicuous actor in that Kingdom. The last time that<br/>
I ever saw him He related to me the following visi<s>n</s>on which he had in his field in open day<br/>
""He said I was carried away in a vision &amp; found myself standing in the midst of a vast<br/>
orchard of fruit trees I became hungry &amp; I wandered through the vast forest of fruit trees<br/>
searching for Fruit to eat but I found n<strike>ot</strike>one &amp; while I stood gazeing in amazement at not<br/>
finding any fruit amid so many trees they began to fall prostrate around me as though they were<br/>
torn up by a whirlwind &amp; they continued to fall untill there was not a tree standing in the whole forest<br/>
I immediately saw young shoots spring up from the roots which formed themselves into young &amp;<br/>
beautiful trees and they immediately budded, blossomed &amp; bore fruit which ripened to maturity which<br/>
was the most beautiful <s>of</s> ^to look upon^ of any thing my eyes had ever beheld and I stretched forth my hand &amp; plucked<br/>
some of the fruit, &amp; I gazed upon it with delight, and as I was about to eat of it the vision closed<br/>
&amp; I did not eat of it at all. I found myself in my field at the close of the vision and I bowed down</p>",
42828.0,17,,"<p>Before the Lord and I called upon his Holy name and asked him to make known unto me the meaming of the <br/>
vision. And the [[voice of the Lord|voice of the Lord]] came unto me saying, Son of man thou hast saught diligently to know<br/>
the truth concerning my Church &amp; kingdom among man, this is to show you that my Church is not organized<br/>
upon the face of the earth in the generation in which you live, neither is the true fruit of the [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]] made<br/>
manifest among the people; but in the days of your children even the rising generation shall the Church &amp; kingdom<br/>
of God be made manifest, revealed and esstablished upon the Earth among the children of men, then shall the<br/>
true fruit of the vine &amp; the gospel of Christ be given unto all those who will receive it &amp; obey the ordinances of the<br/>
Gospel of Salvation. You will live to be<strike>a</strike> made acquainted with it but will not live to partake of it before you depart this<br/>
life, but you will be blessed of the Lord after death because you have followed the dictation of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy<br/>
spirit]] while in life."" when he had finished relating the vision He said to me I am satisfyed that you will<br/>
stand in that Kingdom &amp; assist in building it up, but I shall die before I partake of its ordinances, he then<br/>
blessed me in the name of the Lord &amp; bid me farewell, it being the Last time that I ever saw him. This was in<br/>
1828, and he was vary aged. In <time datetime=""1833-12"">Dec in 1833</time> [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zera Pulsipher]] came to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] Oswego County New York<br/>
whare I was then living He was holding the office of an Elder &amp; he preached the gospel to us in that place<br/>
and I went forth &amp; was Baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and almost<br/>
the first person I thought off was Father [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]] and on my arival in [[Missouri|Missouri]] <s>n</s>as a member<br/>
of [[Zion|Zion Camp]], I wrote a long letter to him &amp; other friends setting forth the <strike>coming</strike> visitation of<br/>
the [[Moroni (BofM)|Angel]] of God, the coming forth of the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], the esstablishment of the Church<br/>
of Christ &amp; Kingdom of God, with the priesthood &amp; all its attendant Blessings and all things<br/>
which I could think of connected with the esstablishment of the Church in its infancy. The<br/>
old Gentleman received the Letter with a great deal of satisfaction &amp; had it read over<br/>
many times to him, &amp; handled it (as he did the fruit in his vision) &amp; rejoiced before the Lord<br/>
but he so<s>n</s>on died &amp; had not an opportunity of receiving the ordinances from under the hands of an<br/>
Elder in the Church, but the first opportunity which I had I was baptized for him in the [[baptismal font|Font]] at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]].<br/>
One of the most remarkable events of Father Masons Life was he said he was called to Fast forty<br/>
days, and he commenced to fast &amp; pray with a determination to Fast the Forty days, but he fasted<br/>
twenty seven days without taking any nourishment or food, but on the twenty seventh day the Lord<br/>
told him to arise &amp; eat for he had excepted his sacrafize as he did [[Abraham (OT)|Abrahams]]. The Lord told him<br/>
to kill a Lamb &amp; cook &amp; eat of it &amp; he did so &amp; his apetite came to him &amp; he partook of a harty<br/>
meal without any injury to him &amp; the next day he walked 10 miles. He considered that He fasted<br/>
the 40 days as Much as Abram offered up his son [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] He felt that he could have fasted the<br/>
40 days as well as the 27. There was a reasonableness in the teachings of this man which so<br/>
firmly agreed with the prophesies &amp; teachings of the Ancient Prophets &amp; Christ and the Apos-<br/>
tles that I firmly believed them with all my heart, And I gave myself to the reading of<br/>
the scriptures &amp; Earnest prayer before God day &amp; night as far as I had an oppertunity<br/>
for years before I herd the preaching of the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness of the Gospel]] by a Latter Day Saint. I<br/>
have plead with the Lord many hours, in the forest, among the rocks, in the fields, in the Mill &amp;<br/>
at midnight that He would give unto me light, truth, &amp; the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]] to lead me in the way<br/>
of salvation And my Prayers were answered untill many things were revealed unto me &amp; my<br/>
mind was opened to the truth so much so that I was fully satisfied that I should live to see the true<br/>
Church of Christ esstablished upon the Earth &amp; a people raised up who would do the [[will of God|will of God]] &amp; <br/>
keep his commandments &amp; who would bring forth the true fruit of that Kingdom</p>",

with Col [[George Cowles|George Cowles]] &amp; remained with him two years attending school during the winter season &amp; worked<br/>
upon his Farm through the summer. while with him during the year <time datetime=""1822"">1822</time> I passed through another great<br/>
revival of religion among the people I like the rest of my young companions attended enquiring meetings<br/>
&amp; prayer meetings among the Pr<strike>y</strike>esb<strike>e</strike>ytarians they being the ownly religious society in the town I also attended their<br/>
Sundy school I laboured &amp; prayed &amp; tried to get religion, but there was sumthing in there manner of teaching<br/>
&amp; exhorting us to give our hearts to God without telling us what to do or pointing out the way so that we could<br/>
understand it or comprehend it that with me it created darkness &amp; not light, misery &amp; not happiness &amp; ther<br/>
teachings did not seem to enlighted my mind or do me Good although I laboured hard to obtain benefit from <br/>
it. many young people were making profession of religion but I did not wish to make a mock of those<br/>
things or profess to be converted &amp; have religion unless I could be made sensible that I had received light<br/>
&amp; truth &amp; sumthing tangible that would be of benefit to me I did pray &amp; labor hard to obtain religion<br/>
but did not feel that I obtained any special light truth or benefit in trying to follow the teachings given me at that time</p>",
42828.0,19,,"<p>I remained with Mr. [[George Cowles|Cowles]] untill <time datetime=""1823-06"">June 1823</time> a little over two years I then returned home &amp; spent the season<br/>
with my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] &amp; worked in the Mill and in the fall My Father made an arangement with Mr.<br/>
[[Andrew Mills|Andrew Mills]] of [[West Hartford, Hartford County, Connecticut|West Hartford]] Ct for me to board with him &amp; do chores for my board &amp; go to school<br/>
According to agreement I soon became a member of Mr. Mills Family &amp; for several weeks I passed<br/>
through a regular course of that distressing d<strike>e</strike>isease called Home sickness I suffered immensly I had never<br/>
before lived at any place whare I had not been free &amp; social. But Mr Mills was a proud Auste[r]e man<br/>
&amp; I had no conversation with him ownly in being asked &amp; answering a question &amp; for about 2 weeks<br/>
I did not eat drink or sleep but little but I soon began to go to school &amp; because acquainted with my<br/>
school mates &amp; my sickness left me &amp; has never yet returned and at the close of the school I returned<br/>
home to my Fathers house in the spring of <time datetime=""1824"">1824</time>. But soon my Father Made a contract with Mr<br/>
[[Horace Hillyear Judd|Horace Judd]] for me to go &amp; work one year with him. He was our nearest neighbor at our homested in [[Northington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Northington]]<br/>
and one of my school mates his [[Calvin Judd|Father]] having died &amp; left him in charge of a large Family of sisters<br/>
He being the ownly son. I commenced work with him but did not stay the year out during the for part<br/>
of winter I split my instep open with an ax which lamed me for abot nine months My Brother<br/>
[[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] took my place and worked my time out also one year for himself. I remained at<br/>
home untill the spring of <time datetime=""1825"">1825</time> when I started from home on horseback to go some 10 miles to engage to work<br/>
for a man a year upon a farm but before I arived there my horse run away with me &amp; flung me among<br/>
some Rocks &amp; broke one of my legs twice in two &amp; put out both Ancles in a shocking manner as recorded in<br/>
the Chapter of incidents. this confined me to the House near two months. the first time that I walked half a<br/>
mile I went to attend the funeral of two men one by the name of [[Noadiah Bird|Bird]] who was murdered by a crazy man named [[Alfred Rowe|Roe]] He<br/>
split open Birds Head with an ax and laid his brains bare &amp; cut his throat from ear to ear, and the other mans name<br/>
was [[E. Drayton Bodwell|Bodwell]] a promising young man who was shot de<strike>d</strike>ad the night after the murder by one of his companions under<br/>
the following circumstances word was given out to take Row either Dead or alive &amp; about 500 men went out into<br/>
the Mountains Hills vallies &amp; the whole country was guarded as the Murderer had hid himself up, they went out 3 or 4 in<br/>
company and Roe had a plad cloak on &amp; Mr Bodwell put on the same kind of a cloak to go out to guard through<br/>
the night, his uncle strongly urged him not to wear the cloak as it might endanger his life. but He thinking <br/>
there would be no danger wore it &amp; during the evening while approching another company a young man by the<br/>
name of Gager seeing a man <strike>by the name of Gager</strike> with a cloak on he thinking that it might be Roe<br/>
He hailed him with the countersign &amp; recieved no answer He then leveled his gun &amp; fired &amp; shot Bodwell<br/>
dead he spoke a few moments &amp; expired I saw the corpses of these men it was the first body which had ben<br/>
murdered that I had ever seen. Roe was finally taken &amp; tryed acquitted upon the plea of insanity but<br/>
put into the insane assylum Gager was tryed for manslaughter, but forfeited &amp; paid his bond rather than run the<br/>
risk of being found guilty. I remained at home with my Father untill April<s>l</s> 1826 at work in the mill I attended<br/>
school during the past winter being 18 years of age. In <time datetime=""1826-04"">April 1826</time> I went to live with widow [[Damaris Bogue Deming|Deming]] in<br/>
the east part of Northington, I staid with her and labored upon her farm for nine m<s>i</s>onths I then returned<br/>
home to my Fathers House and assisted him in his mills. I remained with him untill <time datetime=""1827-04"">April 1827</time> at which<br/>
time I left home &amp; went to live with My Fathers Sister Aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen Wheeler]] I took her Flouring Mill<br/>
and tended it upon shares in East [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] I never again returned to my Fathers House to live with him I<br/>
ownly called as a visitor I was always made welcome at my Fathers House by each member of it this was an<br/>
important period in my feelings to leave my Fathers roof to step forth upon the stage of life to act for myself<br/>
to be my own councellor &amp; form my own caracter in the open broad world filled my mind with serious reflection<br/>
as I wanded my way from my Fathers Roof it created in my mind an anxiety which was more paneful than Joyous</p>",
42828.0,20,,"<p>I was twenty years of age when I left my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] Family &amp; commenced business with aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Wheeler]] I<br/>
remained with her for three years which brought me to <time datetime=""1830"">1830</time>. I had the following reflections on leaving my<br/>
Fathers house. -[should I outlive my Parents how long will it be before I shall follow them to the grave and the places<br/>
which now know them will know them no more &amp; it will be said of them they have gone the way of all the Earth and<br/>
their children while filling their places are following them into the same Eternal world. I am now twenty years of <br/>
age &amp; leaving my Fathers house this is an important period &amp; step in my life &amp; in the life of Evry man for at this<br/>
age generally speaking evry man forms a character both for time and Eternity. The character principles &amp; sentiments<br/>
which are formed from the age of Eightteen to twenty five are generall so deeply planted in the heart that they<br/>
controll their future lives &amp; remain with them through life whether they be good or evil. and I felt to say how<br/>
cautious I ought to be how I pass this link in the chain of my existance I felt that I needed caution prudence<br/>
circumspection &amp; wisdom to guide my Footsteps as I step forth to act for myself. I reflected upon the days of<br/>
my youth which were gone &amp; the speed of time which had flown like an arrow to return no more forever, while<br/>
walk<strike>e</strike>ing in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in the same water neither can we spend twice the same time<br/>
then how ought we to prize the golden moments of time &amp; measure it out with our talents to the honor<br/>
&amp; glory of God &amp; for the salvation of our souls so that when the Lord comes he may recieve his own<br/>
with usury. In trying to comprehend the fleetness of time I asked myself the question whare is the old world<br/>
whare are the Prophets &amp; Apostles whare are the millions of the inhabitants of the Earth including my Father<br/>
&amp; whare are the days of my youth, gone, gone, all gone into the boundless ocean of Eternity whare<br/>
I shall soon find myself]-</p>

<p>During the 3 years which I spent with Aunt Wheeler I passed through quite a school of experiences<br/>
both temporal &amp; spiritual. The class of associates which I made choice of on ariving at my new<br/>
home were young men of the first respectibility in the place yet none of us professed to be guided<br/>
wholey by religious principles Hence we occasionally mingled in parties of pleasure, the Ball room &amp; in<br/>
several instances I took a hand at a game of cards yet I had many fears about taking this step or<br/>
mingling with men who would engage in this dangerous vice yet they were all young men who stood<br/>
high in the estimation of their friends &amp; the world, but the influence of such men whare it is bad is <br/>
the most to be dreaded of any on Earth. becaus the example of the vulgar &amp; disipated will not have<br/>
much influence over the man who intends to maintain a fair standing in society while at the same<br/>
time he might yield to the influence of respectable men in society even to do wrong even to that degree that<br/>
before he is aware of it that he finds that he has sacraficed his time, talents &amp; property for that which<br/>
has done him no good, but brought upon him sorrow, disgrace, misery, &amp; sore repentance &amp; in many instances<br/>
when it is to late to redeem himself. But I felt that the hand of the Lord was over me in this thing as well as in<br/>
evry thing Els for whenever I have y<s>e</s>ielded to the enticement of my associats to stake any thing at the card table<br/>
I had the good fortune in almost evry instance to loose it. I did not however loose but a small amount in<br/>
this way untill I made a strong resolution that I would entirely forsake this vice if no other before I gained<br/>
much of a taste or desire for it which resolution I have always kept. There was a spirit at work with me<br/>
in all recreation the card table, ball room, or any party of pleasure that drew my mind away I took no pleasure<br/>
in those things whatever my anticipations were they all fled when I arived at the spot I seemed to be as a <br/>
spekled birds in the midst of my associates they all seemed to enjoy themselves except me. I at times <br/>
wondered why it was so, but I have since learned there was nothing there which fed the immortal<br/>
mind. Before I commenced doing business for myself I had not acquired much taste for reading with<br/>
the intention of obtaining solid information from books neither had I improved my time in school as I ought to have</p>",

He had a dream a few month before which troubled his mind much. He dreamed there was a Angel<br/>
arived from Heaven &amp; was going through the streets with a roll containing a list of the Deaths of the people<br/>
in that Town during that year And the Angel approached him &amp; unrolled his list &amp; told him<br/>
that there would be funeral attended at his Fathers House on the 27<sup><u>th</u></sup> of Nov He recorded it in his<br/>
Journal &amp; on that vary day he was buried himself.</p>

<p>Soon after I was called to set up for the night<br/>
with the corps of a young man by the name of [[Henry Miller|Henry Miller]] who was vary wicked &amp; profane He<br/>
had been the day before to a celebration of the [[Independence Day|4<sup><u>th</u></sup> of July]] &amp; his Father was a religious man &amp; reproved<br/>
him for his Profanity &amp; wickedness, &amp; while going into the Field to get up some Hay their came up <br/>
a sudden thunder shower. &amp; He<strike>a</strike>nry mocked God &amp; the thunder &amp; in a moment he was struct dead<br/>
standing near his Father I attended his <strike>Father</strike> funeral &amp; it made a deep impression upon my mind<br/>
I remained with Aunt Wheeler during 3 year &amp; 10 days but I lost a good share of my wages by loaning my money<br/>
to an unprincipled young man by the name of [[William Sage|W<sup><u>m</u></sup> Sage]] &amp; Joining my Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] in Fitting out [[Ezra Hart|Ezra Hart]]<br/>
on a padling expedition he turned crazy &amp; lost nearly all we sent out by him I left Aunt Wheelers Family</p>",
42828.0,22,,""">14<sup>th</sup> day of<br/>
May 1830<sup><u>th</u></sup></time>. I commenced boarding with a company of about 30 men, mostly young men but they<br/>
being of a vain worldly turn of mind I did not enjoy myself in their company and I change my<br/>
boarding place took up my residence in a private family by the name of [[Dudly D. Sacket|Dudly D. Sacket]].<br/>
About this time a Reformation broke out in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Connecticut mostly conducted by<br/>
the Methodist denomination My younger brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel H. Woodruff]] made a profession<br/>
of Religion and seemed to be vary much ingaged in the cause which was a great consolation<br/>
to me I attended there meetings and felt to regoic<strike>ed</strike>e to see my brother so much ingaged in<br/>
trying to serve the Lord &amp; acting up to the best light he had. I had a great Desire to do the<br/>
will of God &amp; to know what to do to be saved I prayed night &amp; day as I had an oppertunity<br/>
&amp; the Lord Blessed me with much of his Holy Spirit and I was happy, all things to me seemed<br/>
to praise the Lord the soon [sun], Moon &amp; stars, sky, air land and water, Montains Hills rocks &amp; Dales, forests<br/>
groves meadows &amp; grain all things seemed to praise the Lord. it began to me to be the Hapiest period of <br/>
my life. I had often herd those feelings expressed by individuals but to me it was a blind story untill<br/>
now. My Feelings brought plainly to my mind the words of the <strike>Sl</strike>Psalmest [[David (OT)|David]] whare he plainly expresses</p>",
42828.0,23,,"<p>[[David (OT)|his]] feelings upon this subject when he called upon the Rocks, woods, Mountains, &amp; hills to Praise the Lord He<br/>
calls upon the waves of the sea to praise their God ""He says the Mountains skiped like rams &amp; the Little<br/>
Hills like lambs. He exclaimed what ailed <strike>thee</strike>ye ye mountains that ye skiped like rams &amp; ye little Hills like<br/>
lambs.[""] now my impression is that the mountains did not move but it was the feelings of the Psalmest he was filled<br/>
with such a sense of the [[love of God|Love of God]] &amp; that these th<strike>e</strike>ings were the work of his hands &amp; that God was in them &amp;<br/>
that they were praiseing him, this feelings is enjoyed more or less at times by all who are governed and<br/>
controlled by the [[Holy Spirit|Holy spirit]]. I felt to resolve more and more that I would spend my whole life in the service<br/>
of the Lord. My work was very light in the Mill and I had much leasure time for reading, meditation<br/>
&amp; prayer and I began to read the bible with a more prayerful attention than ever before in my life and<br/>
I found it to be a new book to me it contained truths of the most glorious &amp; sublime nature if I wish for<br/>
History I could find it there. If I was cast down or tried or tempted I there found a remidy in con-<br/>
nextion with the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]]. The Lord is the author of the Book and his promises swep away the darkness<br/>
from my mind. The more I prayed &amp; searched the word of God the more I felt my own weekness &amp; dependence<br/>
upon the Lord. I felt to pray that the Lord would enlighten my my mind, enlarge my heart &amp; give me wisdom<br/>
&amp; understanding.</p>

<p>The reformation continued in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], and a number of my relatives<br/>
were deeply ingaged in the service of the Lord according to the best light they have among whom was uncle<br/>
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozen Woodruff]] &amp; his wife [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah Woodruff]] unto whom I have been much attached all my life having lived a<br/>
good deal with them during my early life I attended meetings freequently with them and Enjoyed<br/>
myself much in their society</p>

<p>There was an Island but a short distance from the Mill the center of which was an ^open^ level field<br/>
covered with wildflowers of various kinds, the Island was surrounded with a rapid current of water, dashing<br/>
over rock, the banks of which were thickly studied with tall waving pines. I chose this Island day &amp; <br/>
night as my place of retirement for prayer, praise &amp; meditation before the Lord I spent many a midnight<br/>
hour alone upon that Island in prayer before the Lord, and the many happy hours in sweet meditation<br/>
which I spent in my lonely walks upon that Plesant retreat I shall never forget in time. The words <br/>
of [[Robert Pollak|Robert Pollock]] in one of his poems often came to my mind while sitting alone in that solitary place<br/>
where He says ""In the wide desert where the view was large, <br/>
""Plesant were many scenes but most to me,  <br/>
""The solitude of vast extant, untouched by hand of art, <br/>
""Whose natured sowed herself, and reaped her crops.<br/>
""Whose garments were the clouds, whose minstrels Brooks,<br/>
""Whose lamps the Moon &amp; stars, whose organ choir the voice of many waters, <br/>
""whose banquits the falling de<strike>es</strike>ws, whose heroes storms, <br/>
""whose warriors mighty winds, whose lovers flowers,<br/>
""Whose orators the thunderbolts of God,<br/>
""Whose palaces the Everlasting hills,<br/>
""Whose ceiling heavens unfathomable blue,<br/>
""And from whose rocky turrets batteled high,<br/>
""Prospects immens spread out on all sides in air,<br/>
""Lost now between the walk in and the main,<br/>
""Now walked with hills that slept above the storm</p>

<p>The roaring waters, the waving pines, giving room to the passing winds, the field of flowers crusted with <br/>
the silver rays of the moon, being all open to the eye and ear while the curtain of heaven <strike>clo</strike> decked with the stars<br/>
and moon mingling with the survey. These things resting upon my mind as the handy work of God in connextion<br/>
with prayer &amp; meditation accompanied by the Holy spirit, gave unto me peculiar charm, sensation Joy &amp; happiness<br/>
which I had never before enjoyed &amp; experienced in my life. The Lord Blessed me with joy happiness &amp; consolation<br/>
becaus I was acting up to the best light and knowledge I had, and when a man will do that in any age of the world<br/>
I am satisfied the Lord will bless him. I had no [[Peter (NT)|Peter]], or Apostle, or any man who held the [[Holy Priesthood|holy Priesthood]] to lead me<br/>
or teach me the way to be saved. So I had to do the <strike>way</strike>best way I could. I got up prayer meetings in our village &amp; prayed</p>",
42828.0,24,,""">20 day of March 1831</time><br/>
I spent one year with Mr Cowles During my stay there I attended meetings with the various denominations of the place I also held<br/>
meetings with the young people I found several persons with whom my spirit was congenial with my feelings among whom<br/>
was two men by the name of Lyman &amp; Buel there feelings &amp; views were in a measure similar to my own<br/>
we visited each other much &amp; prayed together often &amp; spent many a good hour together in prayer &amp; conversing<br/>
upon the things of God. there were several protracted meetings in the Town while I was there I freequently<br/>
attended &amp; several ministers asked me to Join their churches I would ask them if they had the faith that was<br/>
once delivered to the saints, if they laid hands upon the sick &amp; had dreams Revelations &amp; visions as did the Ancient<br/>
Saints &amp; if they had Prophets and Apostles they would say no these are not needed now they are done away so<br/>
I could not believe as they did so I did not Join any church but I gave myself constantly to Prayer reading<br/>
the Bible, &amp; meditation and I called upon the Lord Earnestly to lead and guide me I spent many hours in the<br/>
woods among the Rocks &amp; in the mill at midnight calling upon the Lord to teach me what to do I finally made<br/>
the following prayer &amp; petition unto the Lord with a determination to ask untill I obtained an answer ""O Lord<br/>
are the priest &amp; People who profess th<s>e</s>y name and who appear zealous in thy cause by holding many meetings<br/>
&amp; call upon th<strike>e</strike>y name with a loud voice &amp; who labour hard to make many prosel<strike>i</strike>ytes are they th<strike>e</strike>y people are<br/>
they &amp; their works excepted at thine hand. if so O Lord why am I separated from them in spirit</p>",
42828.0,25,,"<p>why cannot I feel at home with them &amp; worship with them why am I left alone like a speckled bird of the<br/>
forest why do they oppose me in those things which the [[spirit of God|spirit]] &amp; [[word of God|word of God]] teach me is true. And again<br/>
if they are not the people of God and are not excepted of thee why do they prosper why do they gather<br/>
many souls unto there churches who appear cincere. And if they are not the people of the Lord where<br/>
shall I find th<strike>e</strike>y people O Lord show me these things and teach me what to do and I covenant to<br/>
obey thy voice and do thy will, and after praying earnestly onto the Lord with this prayer on a<br/>
certain night in my mill untill after midnight the [[spirit of the Lord|spirit of the Lord]] rested upon me &amp; the voice of<br/>
the spirit of the Lord said unto me go to my word &amp; I will there show thee my will and answer<br/>
thy prayer. I opened the Bible promiscously praying the Lord in my heart to direct my mind to<br/>
that portion of his word which would answer my prayes &amp; show me the truth and I opened to the<br/>
LVI Chapter of Isaiah which I read and was satisfied that it was in answer to my prayer. I was satisfied<br/>
the salvation of God was abot to be revealed and his righteousness to come forth I was also satisfied that I should<br/>
live to see the people of God gathered, and I should be with them and that I should have a name &amp; a place<br/>
in the [[house of God|House of God]] with his sons and Daughters, and I felt that I ought not any more to say that I was<br/>
utterly seperated from the people of God. I a<strike>s</strike>lso believed that the priests of the day were in great measure like<br/>
the shepherds described in that chapter that they were ignorant and did not understand, and that they all looked<br/>
for their gain from there quarter and that they were not satisfied and were like greedy dogs who could never<br/>
have enough. from that hour I was satisfyed to remain as I was untill I should find the people of God which I<br/>
looked for in faith and believed I should know them when I saw them. I had no one to lead or guide me in the<br/>
way of the Lord except the spirit and word of God, these I tried to cling unto. My mind abut this time was<br/>
deeply exercised upon one principle and that was Keeping the seventh day of the week for the sabbath in[stead]<br/>
of the first day I found that the seventh day was esstablished by the Lord himself as the sabbath day<br/>
and all Israel was commanded to keep it as the sabbath day forever throughout there generation &amp;<br/>
I could never find where the Lord ever changed the sabbath day. Jesus &amp; the Apostles kept the seventh<br/>
day of the week as do all the Jews up to the present time and my mind was troubled upon this subject<br/>
and I was never satisifyed in my mind upon the subject untill I promised the Lord that I would keep that<br/>
day for the sabbath as soon as I was liberated from the gentile yoke so that I could. During the spring of <time datetime=""1832"">1832</time><br/>
while at Mr [[Richard B. Cowles|Cowles]] I read a short article in a News Paper stating that there was a New sect rising up that<br/>
were called Mormons that professed to have the ancient gifts of the gospel they [[heal the sick|healed the sick]], [[casting out devils|cast out devils]]<br/>
[[gift of tongues|spoke in tongues]] and performed miracles as the Apostles did and that they were going up to [[Missouri|Missouri]] to a place<br/>
they called Zion and that they had got a New Book called the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] which was revealed<br/>
to them by an [[Moroni (BofM)|angel]] of God. The Editor of the paper ridiculed the people I heard there was one of the Books<br/>
in [[Barkhamsted, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Barkhampstead]] 10 miles distant from me I felt very anxious to obtain it to read but I did not get an<br/>
oppertunity. I said when I saw the article and read it that I did not care what was said about <br/>
the people if they really had the gifts which the Ancient Saints possessed it was all I would ask, they<br/>
were the very people which I was looking for.</p>

<p>I settelled up my business with Mr Cowles in<br/>
an Amicable manner although he wished me to remain with him yet I had made up my mind to go to the<br/>
Western Country to purchase a farm. for about 2 weeks previous to leaving him my mind was deeply<br/>
exercised upon the subject of going to [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] the spirit that was upon me day and night said<br/>
go to Rhode Island. I called upon my Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon's]] to stop with him untill we should start for the<br/>
west. as soon as the salutation was past I said to him I wondered what the Lord wanted of me in<br/>
Rhode Island for the spirit of the Lord had rested upon me for 2 weeks &amp; said to me go to Rhode Island</p>",
42828.0,26,,"<p>In about one ^hour^ after this my Brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] also arived upon a visit and after shaking hands almost<br/>
the first words which he spoke was I wonder what the Lord wants of me in [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] for the<br/>
[[spirit of the Lord|spirit of the Lord]] has been upon me for two or three weeks and told me to go to Rhode Island this caused<br/>
us to marvel as we had not spoken to each other or seen each other for several months I felt convinced it<br/>
was our duty to go there yet we could not tell what it meant. But Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] thought that as<br/>
we were about prepareing to go to the west we had Better omit it &amp; I reluctantly consented to it. Subsequently I<br/>

and had we <strike>have</strike> gone we should certainly have embraced the work &amp; Joined the Latter Day Saints<br/>
for we were prepared in our minds to have received the truth at that time But like [[Jonah (OT)|Jonah]] who was<br/>
sent to [[Nineveh|Nineveh]] went to [[Tarshish, Lebanon|Tarshish]] so I insted of going to Rhode Island Prepaired myself &amp; went to<br/>

we spent a day or two at Fathers House then went on our Journey for the west not knowing whare<br/>
we should go we finally wandered about through the western part of New York finally went north<br/>

Souls and Azmon returned to [[Connecticut|Connecticut]] for his Family He soon returned &amp; we commenced farming &amp; fencing<br/>
&amp; lumbering which business we followed together untill the spring of <time datetime=""1834"">1834</time>. As soon as I commenced doing business<br/>
for myself I commenced keeping sat<strike>r</strike>urday the seventh day of the week for the sabbath as did my Brother <br/>
Azmon. we held meetings upon the seventh day and several others in the neighborhood attended the<br/>
meetings with us and kept the same day of the week for the sabbath I also attended with the various<br/>
donominations that were around us freequently. My Brother Azmon had been a vary peculiar person<br/>
from his childhood up He had been vary strict to his bible, his prayers &amp; to his God. He prayed much<br/>
from his childhood &amp; had much of the spirit of the Lord &amp; had much light &amp; I was much edifyed &amp; <br/>
interested with his teaching &amp; conversation He would never employ a physician when sick but always<br/>
trust in the Lord we were in Richland when the cholera first made its appearance into the United States via carrier<br/>
into [[Sackets Harbor, Jefferson County, New York|Sackets Harbor]]. My Brother Azmon had a severe attack of the cholera in the fall of <time datetime=""1833"">1833</time> I [[laying on of hands|laid hands]]<br/>
upon his head with his [[Elizabeth Norton Hart Woodruff|wife]] according to his request &amp; prayed for him and Asked the Lord in the name of <br/>
Jesus Christ to rebuke his desease &amp; command it to Depart from him &amp; the cholera was stayed from the hour<br/>
and in the morning He was able to walk about &amp; He immediately recovered. this had always been his faith<br/>
from his youth up He had been through some severe fits of sickness but would not empl[o]y any medical aid<br/>
but always trusted in God, believing it was his privilege to be healed by the prayer of faith and the laying on<br/>
of hands as it was in Ancient days this was the state of mind we were both in when the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness of the gospel]]<br/>
reached us by an [[Zerah Pulsipher|Elder]] of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. we were looking to find a people<br/>
who would build up the Ch<strike>irst</strike>urch of Christ according to the Ancient Pattern. Thus I have given a Brief synopsis<br/>
of my life &amp; experience up to the time of my Embracing the fulness of the gospel &amp; Joining the Latter day Saints which<br/>
event was one of Great Joy to me which laid the foundation of a greater &amp; more glorious work then<br/>
ever I expected to see in this life &amp; I Pray God in the name of Jesus Christ to guide my future life<br/>

of a man almost entire and an Arrow was found sticking in his back bone Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] picked it<br/>
out &amp; brought it into camp with one of his legs bones which had broaken He put the leg bone in my waggon<br/>

care of Zebedee Coultrin during the night as he had no one with him Brother Joseph was also afflicted<br/>
with it for several days. Brother Ingels had been my companion all the way from my home in<br/>

suffered more or less &amp; some 15 had died &amp; he said to the Saints if you will now humble yourselves<br/>

<p>I attended ^meetings^ through the summer we occasionally had preaching from the Elders who<br/>
were appointed to teach &amp; evry sabbath we had meetings at Brother Wights &amp; broke bread &amp; exhorted<br/>
each other to faithfulness. I also occasionally met with the Teachers Quorum which office I still held<br/>

ancient order of the Church, and he rejoiced when the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness of the gospel]] came unto us and<br/>
was baptized under the hands of [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] at the same time that I was and when I left I<br/>
gave him a power of Attorney to sell my Property at the same time that he did his so that He could<br/>
come on to Zion. The following is an extract of his letter which shows that he had Apostitized<br/>
and left the Church His letter was Dated [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] Oswago County N Y. Aug 9<sup>th</sup> 1834.</p>

<p>""Brother Wilford I wish to call your Attention a few moments while we take a glance at what is<br/>
called Mormonism. you well know that my mind was tryed on the subject before you left us in<br/>
the spring. I have since you left endeavored to look at the subject with an impartial Eye and<br/>
weigh it in an ^even^ balance and try it by Gods word and spirit, even the word spoken by the Ancient Apostles<br/>
and Prophets and by Christ himself and if any man speak not according to this word Judge ye<br/>
whether in such a case it is right to receive or not."" ""[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] says by Revelation that there<br/>
shall be 500 ^or less^ of the Lords warriors or valiant <strike>men</strike>young men and middle Aged raised who should go up to<br/>
Redeem and Defend Zion, and you are not ignorant Brother of their taken carnal weapons such as<br/>
fire Arms spears dirks swords &amp;c &amp;c. Jesus Christ sayes put up thy sword into its sheath all they that taketh <br/>
the sword shall perish with the sword [##Matthew 26:52##]. Further more Jesus say<strike>e</strike>s if thine Enemy hunger feed him if he thirst<br/>
give him drink [##Romans 12:20##]. Again love ye your Enemies bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you<br/>
and pray for them that despitefully use ^you^ and persecute you [##Matthew 5:44##], and all this for what, the answer is that ye may<br/>
be like your [[Father in Heaven|Father in heaven]]. Again Jesus says unto you that ye resist not evil if <strike>the</strike> a man smite you<br/>
on the one cheek, offer the other also [##Matthew 5:39##]. He did not say after you have been smitten once, thrice or twice take the<br/>
sword and fight and slay your enemies, but the contrary, he taught both by precept and example. And<br/>
perhaps you may ask shall we suffer our Enemies to destroy us. shall we suffer ourselves to be trodden down<br/>
as the mire of the streets and make no resistance. In answer I would say If we take Jesus for an<br/>
Ensample sure it is that we should not fight and resist evil. for when was our great Ensample<br/>
ever known to retaliate or resist, or revenge or take vengance. No this He never done but suffered<br/>
himself to be lead as a sheep to the slaughter and like a Lamb before his shearers &amp;c"" [##Isaiah 53:7##] Now Brother<br/>
how near a like is the procedings of the Mormons and example and precepts of Christ I will tell you""</p>",
42828.0,37,,"<p>as much alike as light and darkness. And there is as much agreement <strike>between</strike> in the proceedings of the morm-<br/>
ons and their preceps &amp; examples of Christ as there is between Christ and Balial and no more. If I am able to<br/>
Judge in this respect. If they persecute you in this city flee ye into another [##Matthew 10:23##] does this look like disputeing<br/>
the ground with the point of the sword at the peril of our lives. there is much in the Testimony if my limits would<br/>
admit that I would like to call your attention unto but cannot at this time"" ""There is one thing more<br/>
however that I cannot forbear to mention and that is division in families or rather breaking up of families<br/>
as to the revelations upon this point I am not so well informed, but have understood from the Brethren from <br/>
different se<strike>t</strike>ctions that it was the duty of heads of families or say the Husband or man as he is the head if he is a<br/>
believer it is his duty to <strike>forsake</strike> ^pursuade^ his wife to go with him up to Zion if in his power but if she will not be pursuaded<br/>
to go with him, then it is his duty to gather up his substance and go up to Zion and leave his wife &amp; family behind<br/>
Now I would ask what is there in the [[Old Testament|Old]] or [[New Testament|New Test<strike>i</strike>ament]] that will support a man in such a course as this the<br/>
[[Mark (NT)|Apostle]] says if the unbelieveing depart let him depart but there is no liberty given to the believer to leave one of his<br/>
family what God hath joined together let no man put assunder. [##Mark 10:9##] Now for instance were I to leave my family &amp; take<br/>
with me my substance (if I had any) and go up to Zion should I not according to the testimony (not of Mormonism) but of<br/>
Eternal truth be under censure,"" ""should I not be one that refused to provide for his own, even those of his own house<br/>
if so then I should be the man that had den<strike>y</strike>ied the faith &amp;c."" ""I have been taking a view of the revelations of<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and I am persuaded that they not ownly contradict <strike>the</strike>Christ and the Apostles but they contradict themselves<br/>
And I must receive Smiths Revelations and reject Christs or Receive Christs &amp; the Apostles &amp; reject Smith's As<br/>
I cannot be vary particular here I will ownly ask you to look at one or two. What does the Revelations say concerning<br/>
the Lords warriors the Revelations says as I understood [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] That inasmuch as 500 of the Lords warriors &amp; <br/>
valiant young men &amp;c raised &amp;c &amp; if 500 could not be had 400, 300, 200 or 100 but not to return less than 100 [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:32-34##] And<br/>
I understood the Revelation to say that with them I would redeem Zion and if I understood your letter there was over<br/>
200 went up in the [[Zion|camp]] to redeem Zion armed with various weapons of war. Now the Revelation says that<br/>
Zion cannot be redeemed because the strength of the [[Lord|Lords House]] has not come up"" Again you say that the Lord<br/>
says by revelation that He is well pleased with those who have come up even as he was pleased with [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]]<br/>
And we know that God was so well pleased with Abraham that He swore to him with an oath. Yet we are<br/>
informed that the Lord sent the [[destroying angel|destroying Angel]] into your camp to purge &amp; clense it. Now Brother if you cannot<br/>
see any impropriety and contradiction in those Revelations as well as others, then I <strike>i</strike>entreat you to stop for <br/>
a moment and consider and look again, also the Revelation concerning their stay at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] at first it<br/>
was to be but 5 years, now there is to be a [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] built there, and it is to be one of the stake of Zion not to<br/>
be removed &amp;c."" ""I intreat my Brother for Heavens sake &amp; for your own souls <strike>sake</strike> &amp; Body sake to look at<br/>
those things &amp; compare them with themselves &amp; with others of the Revelations And also try them by [[word of God|<strike>g</strike>Gods word]]<br/>

upon Joseph Smith caused them to be uttered and written for our learning and profit. And whereas two cannot<br/>

42828.0,38,,""">Nov 29<sup><u>th</u></sup> 1834</time></p>

<p>To all my Kinsfolks in Richland. I received your letter<br/>
under date of Aug 9<sup><u>th</u></sup> But have not attempted to Answer it untill the present time. But being sensible that<br/>
time is short with many of this generation, I feel desireous to address you by letter as I think it vary uncertain<br/>
whether I ever ^shall^ behold your faces again untill I <strike>f</strike> meet you at the [[bar of God|bar]] of the <strike>g</strike>Great Jehovah. I would inform <br/>
you that my health is good and at present I possess a contented mind. It rejoices my soul that the Lord<br/>
hath speared my life to the present time and supported me through so many dangers seen and unseen<br/>
both temporally and spiritually and embraced me within the [[new and everlasting covenant|new and Everlasting covenant]] and given me the<br/>
privilege of Enjoying the society of those [[servants of God|servants of God]] who are determined to follow Christ through evil as<br/>
well as good report. Brethren; it was a satisfaction to me to hear from you, yet some of the contents of<br/>
your letters <strike>g</strike>caused me pain and that too for your sakes. And in answering your letter I must answer my ^own^<br/>
mind and clear my soul of your Blood, that your Blood be not required at my hands at the bar of God.<br/>
And could I have the privilege I would rather clear my mind by conversing face to face than by writing<br/>
but as I am wholey deprived of that privilege I feel it my duty to do it by writing and also to answer some<br/>
of your questions. Brethren in answering your letter I have no desire to injure your feelings yet I must<br/>
be plain and answer my mind and what I say to you I shall say with a realizeing sens that I shall one<br/>
day be called to give an account for this act to that God who has made me &amp; redeemed my soul.<br/>
Brother Thompson let me answer you by saying that the cause of my leaving Richland when and</p>",
42828.0,39,,"<p>as I did was not to injure you or out of any ill will towards you but I did this act with a settelled belief<br/>
that it was my duty. And I am more and more convinced that I did my duty in so doing. I acknowledge<br/>
your question to be vary civil in asking me wh<strike>i</strike>y I ""could not stay whare I was and worship God under<br/>
the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth and with Liberty."" In answering this question I would<br/>
say that you have the sentiments of my heart when I say that I verily believe that [[Lot (OT)|Lot]] would have<br/>
been as safe to have remained in Sodom after being warned to flee out by the Angel of God as I should<br/>
have been to have remained in [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], calculating to make it my abiding place with the light I had<br/>
before me. No I could not remain there and worship God under the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth<br/>
because the voice to me is, come out of her ye my people that ye partake not of her sins that ye receive not of her<br/>
plagues [##Revelation 18:4##]. Brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] you may be assured that God hath not finished his work on the Earth &amp;<br/>
his <strike>w</strike>sword is hathed in heaven and will soon fall upon Idumea or the world [##Isaiah 34:5##] yea I believe that<br/>
most awful events await this generation yea I believe God is about to exhort his power to overthrow Babylon<br/>
and to shake both Earth and heaven. yea I believe that sword pestilence and famine await this generation<br/>
of the human family who do not repent and turn unto God and [[stand in holy places|stand in Holy places]]. Brother Thompson<br/>
I feel deeply interested in your welfare and salvation both Temporally and spiritually both for time <br/>
&amp; Eternity therefore let me this once perhaps for the last time war<s>e</s>n you to prepare to meet your <strike>g</strike>God and<br/>
also this once not to despise &amp; reject the revelations of Jesus Christ for he will soon come to judge every man<br/>
for the deeds done in the body. Brother Thompson what more can I say to you, it is a day of warning<br/>
&amp; not of many words [##Doctrine and Covenants 63:58##], the day is not far distant when you will know of a truth whether the cause<br/>
in which I am Engaged is of God or from a source of Darkness and Error. Yea I verily believe the<br/>
hour is nigh at the door that will report in the Ears of those who remain in Babylon far more heart rending scenes <br/>
respecting the things which await them &amp; will overtake them than you are permitted to receive from my pen.<br/>
Although I should incur the displeasure of many of my fellow men or even my relatives by the [[grace of God|grace of<br/>
God]] assisting me I shall not scease to exhort my influence or to lift my voice to warn this generation to prepare<br/>
themselves to be accounted worthy to escape the Just Judgements of God that awaits this generation. I do not<br/>
expect to remain stationary long in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] But I expect to travel south during the winter how much<br/>
longer I do not know * * Brother Thompson I now bid you farewell and I desire that while the kingdoms<br/>
of this world are overturning that you may receive and obey the [[Celestial Law|celestial Law]] of God that you may abide<br/>
a [[celestial glory|celestial Glory]] And that God will Enlighten your understanding to that degree that you may so improve<br/>
the blessings which are within your reach in the last days so as to find a seat in the [[celestial kingdom|Celestial Kingdom]] of God with<br/>
[[Abraham (OT)|Abram]] [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] and [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]] is the prayer of your Absent Brother Wilford Woodruff</p>

<p>Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] I not ownly feel it a privilege but my duty to address you <strike>this</strike> again by writing and<br/>
answer some of your questions given to me in your communication. I am sensible we cannot give<br/>
a fair representation of things by writing as by word of mouth. We are more liable to form wrong<br/>
conceptions of things by letter (even where the intention is good) than by word of mouth. The questions<br/>
which you have asked in your letter appear very clear to me and could I see you I think I could <s>e</s><br/>
explain them to your satisfaction but it is a thing almost impossible to do it upon one sheet of paper<br/>
yet I feel it my duty to say a few words respeting some of them as it respects carnal weapons being<br/>
used by the saints of God in the last days there is much said up on the subject by the Ancient Prophets<br/>
The Plough shares are to be beat into swords &amp; the pruneing hooks into spears, Let th[e] weak say I am strong [##Joel 3:10##]<br/>
Yea, one is to chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight [##Deuteronomy 32:30##] this is to take place in Gods own time<br/>
in the [[last days|last days]]. It is to be said to Zion, (according to the Prophet [[Isaiah (OT)|Isaiah]]) that her horn should be made</p>",
42828.0,40,,"<p>""Iron and her hoofs Brass and she should beat, in peaces many people &amp;c"" [##Micah 4:13##] As it respects the remark I made<br/>
about the Lord's being pleased with those who came up in th[e] [[Zion|camp of Zion]] or they being compared with<br/>
[[Abraham (OT)|Abram]], it was their offering which he was pleased with. that is to say they were willing to lay down <br/>
thare lives for Christs sake and the sake of their Brethren. Yet He was not pleased with any murmurings<br/>
or complainings that might be in the camp but rather they were chastized for it, some mens sins go<br/>
to judgment beforehand while others follow after. Again as it respects [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] being a stake of Zion<br/>
there never has been any revelation given to infringe upon Kirtland's being a stake of Zion or <br/>
bearing any import why it should not become a stake &amp; evry word of the Lord be fulfilled.<br/>
Because the Lord said He would not hold any guilty who should go up to Zion with an open<br/>
heart, after the space of 5 years, which time the Lord willeth to retain a strong hold in the Land of <strike>Zion</strike><br/>
Kirtland [##Doctrine and Covenants 64:21-22##]. This saying does not prove that Kirtland will not be a stake of Zion for a longer <br/>
period than 5 years but it goes to show that the Lord wished many of his servants to remain in<br/>
Kirtland that length of time for a special purpose. Neither does it prove because the Lord<br/>
has commanded his people to build unto his name a [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] or a city that it will not eventually<br/>
be thrown down. Again you say that if the brethren or sisters in [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] are a fair sample<br/>
of Mormonism you wish to be delivered from it. I wish to ask you if you consider such means<br/>
a fair way to investigate the subject, if they as members of the Church of Christ have done wrong<br/>
does this prove that the whole body is corrupted or that it is not a true church. Because there was<br/>
a [[Judas (NT)|Judas]] with Christ and the Apostles, does that prove that they were fals teachers or Christ a<br/>
fals Prophet certainly not. Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] I think it is for the want of intelligence &amp; <br/>
information that causes you to discover such gross Errors and contradictions (as in your view)<br/>
there is in the Revelations given in there last days. for my part I cannot discover any<br/>
contradictions in themselves or that contradicts the teachings, precepts, &amp; revelations of Jesus<br/>
Christ our Savior. But rather I behold them beaming with gospel light, truth intelligence and glory<br/>
Brother Azmon I was not a little surprised to learn from your letter that you had denyed and<br/>
rejected the Revelations of Jesus Christ for I know them to be such which you have rejected. I<br/>
say I was not a little surprised to learn this fact after your having received as great a degree of<br/>
light as you have in your day and generation. Let me this one call your mind to review the past with<br/>
reflection, and at the same time permit me to ask you some questions. I wish you to call to mind the days and<br/>
years of your youth. while standing as it were alone to maintain and contend for that faith once delivered<br/>
to the Saints. Also the many times you have stood and proclaimed in the ears of this generations those<br/>
things which awaited them if they rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ. Again have you not long been<br/>
looking for the Church of Christ to arise out of the wilderness of darkness and Error yea when you<br/>
heard the sound of the gospel proclaimed did you not gladly receive it with your whole soul and went<br/>
forth and was baptized the first sermon that you herd an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter<br/>
day saints deliver unto the people. I now wish to ask you, By what spirit was you actuated and moved upon<br/>
when you bore witness unto your fellow men and testifyed unto them that the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]] bore witness to<br/>
you of the truth of the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] and by what spirit was you governed when you went<br/>
to Brother [[Noah Hatton|Holton]] in the name of the Lord and told him if He rejected the work which the Latter Day<br/>
Saints brought unto us that his days would be short and what light he had would be taken from him<br/>
And also when you told [[William Hubbard|W<sup><u>m</u></sup> Hubbard]] that you knew that He would be condemned if He rejected it<br/>
And also when you declaired that you was Delivered both soul and body by the [[laying on of hands|laying on off hands]] of</p>",
42828.0,41,,"<p>Elder [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] in the name of the Lord. I believe that you was actuated and moved upon by the [[spirit of God|spirit of<br/>
God]] yea I believe that you was honest and sincere in those things. And if this was the case let me now<br/>
ask by what spirit are you governed and controlled when you turn around and deny and reject these<br/>
things it certainly is not of God. And now Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] considering exhisting circumstances<br/>
with you I cannot forbear unreservedly telling you what I Believe concerning you and your course<br/>
when I have behel the light and Glory that the [[Celestial Law|Celestial Law]] and [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]] is presenting to us in these<br/>
[[last days|last days]] it has been a source of Great Enjoyment to me in the reflection that the day was near when<br/>
I should Join with you in the kingdom of God in partaking of those Celestial Immortal and Eternal<br/>
glories But Alas how am I disappointed Brother Azmon unless you repent like [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] and humble<br/>
yourself before God I do not ever expect to meet you there. Dear Sir you have but a faint<br/>
idea of the immortal Joys &amp; glories that you have in a voluntary manner deprived yourself<br/>
the privilege of ever enjoying. I intreat you in Christ stead to stop while to stop is in your<br/>
power and consider the awful calamity and destruction you are bringing upon your own soul.<br/>
I mean by denying the Lord that bought you, and put him to an open shame. perhaps you may<br/>
consider this a light thing But those revelations which you have denyed are the Revelation of Jesus<br/>
Christ And you will soon find it a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God. I had not<br/>
received your letter when I sent you the [[Book of Commandments|Book of Commandments]] and if you have received them<br/>
and consider them of No worth unto you, You will do me a favor by giving them to Brother Fisk<br/>
or to someone in the church of the Latter Day Saints. But above all things I warn you to beware about<br/>
treating those things with disdain or making ridic<s>l</s>ule of them for of a truth if you do they will<br/>
rise in Judgment against you. you now profess to believe those revelations to be of man &amp; not of God<br/>
but should they at last prove to be of God it would be better for you that they had not fallen into your hands<br/>
inasmuch as you treat lightly the things which they contain. But there is no doubt upon my mind upon<br/>
this subject And I again warn you in the name of Jesus Christ that you no more tread lightly those<br/>
Revelations and Commandments for in so doing you treat with disdain the council of the Almighty<br/>
and set at naught the Revelations of Jesus Christ and if you continue to do those things they will serve<br/>
to pearce your soul Yea if you continue such a course and do not repent you will have cause to<br/>
drink with carefulness &amp; Eat your bread with trembling for your days of prosperity will be few<br/>
Brother Azmon the day is nigh even at your own door when you will know of a truth that these<br/>
sayings are not fables but Eternal truths. the time is at hand when the heavens will be rolled together as<br/>
a scroll and Jesus Christ will be revealed in the clouds of Heaven with his saints to take vengance on<br/>
those who know not God and obey not the Gospel And He will reward evry man according to the deeds<br/>
done in the body.</p>

<p>Brother Azmon I have dealt thus plain with you that I may be clear of your<br/>
Blood and be found acquitted at the [[bar of God|bar of God]]. I think it doubtful whether I meet you short of<br/>
the Eternal world. But I commend you into the hands of Almighty God who doeth all things<br/>
wright. I leave these remarks in your hands to deal with as you see fit. But remember we are<br/>
Accountable to God for all the deeds done in the Body That the Lord will be merciful unto you and deliver<br/>
you from Darkness And Error, give you light and truth &amp; so direct your remaining days as to cause you to<br/>
repent and humble yourself before God that you may again Embrace the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness]] of the [[everlasting gospel|Everlasting Gospel]] &amp; the<br/>
[[new and everlasting covenant|New and everlasting covenant]] that you may escape the Just Judgments of God is the earnest Prayer of you[r]<br/>
Absent Brother.</p>

<p>I would say to all my friends that I desire your welfare and your salvation And<br/>
I intreat you all not to treat lightly or abuse any sacred things or principles which you have in</p>",

to visit them for a few minutes not expecting to tarry; but<br/>

the evening I had an interview with Elder [[Arnold Stephens|Arnold Stephens]].</p>

privation and that we could not travel through that country.</p>

to stop for a season in the region of Rochester as doors were<br/>

<p>On the following day still indisposed in health<br/>
I walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] wrote a letter to ^my brother^ [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]] and<br/>
spent the night with Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] at brother [[John Benbow|Benbow's]]<br/>
and the next day I occupied in writing to several of my friends in<br/>
America. There was a meeting that night at Froom's Hill when<br/>
Elder Young preached and we ordained [[Thomas Henry Clark|Thomas Clark]] to the office<br/>
of Priest.</p>

<p>I walked with Elder Brigham Young to [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|^Dymock^]]<br/>
next day the 30th and had an interview with Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]] and<br/>
Kington with whom we spent the night. I received three letters<br/>
one from ^Mother^ [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Woodruff]] one from [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] and the other<br/>
from [[Alfred Cordon|H Cordon]].</p>

<p>My travels and labours continued and on the<br/>
5th of May I preached at [[Crowcutt, Worcestershire, England|Crowcutt]] and baptized 5 persons and<br/>
confirmed them one of whom was a preacher and on the 6th I<br/>
baptized and confirmed them and afterwards preached at<br/>
[[Dunns Close, Herefordshire, England|Dun's Close]] and walked to [[Tapperdy, Herefordshire, England|Taperdin]] where I baptized and<br/>
confirmed 4 making on this day one of whom was a preacher</p>

<p>The next day I walked to [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]]<br/>
and preached at [[Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Colwall]] and on the following visited the Saints<br/>
and friends at Malvern Hill</p>

<p>In my walk to Colwall on the 9<sup>th</sup>, I had<br/>
a grand survey of Nature send the Power of the Creator while<br/>
standing upon the top of Malvern Hill elevated from 1200 to<br/>
1500 feet above the level. The surrounding country was before<br/>
my view<strike>s</strike> stretched out many miles. [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] City lies on the<br/>
North and is clearly seen in the prospect and [[Gloucestershire, England|Gloster]] on the South<br/>
with several large villages between laid stretch out before me<br/>
with [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]] and other villages in the West and a fine beautiful<br/>
cultivated vale upon every hand</p>

<p>While standing upon the eminance of this<br/>
noted Hill beholding the grand and charming prospect before me<br/>
the thunders began to roll and the lightenings flash beneath<br/>
my feet in the vale below on which the rain descended in<br/>
torrents. The solemnity and granduer of the scene was<br/>
impressive as I stood on the Hill above the clouds surveying<br/>
the beautiful works of the Creator and his majesty in the storm.</p>",

with her children at the house of sister [[Sarah Marrietta Kingsley Howe Cleveland|Cleaveland]]</p>

<p>Sister Smith had passed through a scene of<br/>
severe affliction since I last saw her and even at this time<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] her husband was in [[Liberty Jail, Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|prison]] with other of the Saints</p>

<p>^We^ I took dinner with sister Emma and afterwards<br/>
we rode to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] a distance of 4 miles</p>

<p>Here an interesting scene was met. I first called<br/>
at the house occupied by [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Father]] and Mother [[Lucy Mack Smith|Smith]] the<br/>
parents of Joseph and also by his brothers [[Samuel Smith|Samuel]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Carlos]]<br/>
and their families.</p>

<p>The street was the next scene and here<br/>
I met on every hand the Saints with whom I had been<br/>
formerly acquainted. There were Petty, [[Randolph Alexander|Alexander]], [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]],<br/>
and their families from the South; and there were [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]], [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], [[John Portineus Greene|J. P. Green]] and most all the other<br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] Saints. Soon brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan Hale]] came<br/>
along with a shovel on his back and gave me a ""How<br/>
do you do brother Woodruff?""</p>

<p>I saw so many old friends that I hardly<br/>
knew who to go home with first. Finally I concluded<br/>
to go home and spend the night with Brother Jonathan</p>

<p>We had an interesting time together in talking <br/>
over our travels upon the Islands of the sea. He also gave<br/>
me an account of the sufferings of himself and family and<br/>
of the sufferings of the Saints in [[Missouri|Missouri]] during the<br/>
past winter.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Missouri had become<br/>
transformed into a State mob with Governor [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Bogg]] at<br/>
their head. They came from time to time upon the<br/>
Saints in battle array. Our people were shot down by<br/>
them like wild beast others were butchered in cold blood<br/>
and some had their brains knocked out after they were taken<br/>
prisoners. The soldiers also shot down the cattle cows<br/>
and hogs of the Saints for the mere purpose of destroying<br/>
them.</p>

<p>At times the Saints stood in their own defence<br/>
and some of their enemies fell before them. In consequence<br/>
of this the Governor of Missouri issued orders for the</p>",

returned to Brother Hubbal's to keep an appointment.<br/>

our leasure time in laboring whenever we were. This<br/>
I considered right.</p>",

confirmed 12 and then preached at brother Lucy's dined<br/>

<p>A Visit<br/>
On The [[Herefordshire Beacon, Herefordshire, England|Herfordshire Beacon]]<br/>
South of Malvern Hill.</p>

<p>Having my mind prepared for a lonely walk<br/>
and meditation by reading [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt's]] Book upon<br/>
the ""Eternal Duration of matter I commenced ascending th<strike>e</strike>is<br/>
famed hill upon the south side and after ascending several<br/>
hundred feet <strike>I</strike> came to the top of an ancient entrenchment<br/>
about a mile in length reaching around all this part<br/>
of the Hill and meeting. Having ascended about one<br/>
hundred feet farther I entered another entrenchment like<br/>
the one below and after that another; and thus entrenchment<br/>
after entrenchment above each other until I reached<br/>
the top of the Hill which was nearly a flat or level surface<br/>
of circular shape and not more than from one to two<br/>
acres in size. Thus I stood upon this Beacon of <br/>
Hertfordsire more than a thousand feet in height surveying<br/>
the surrounding county from which I could fairly gaze<br/>
upon the tiers of entrenchments below me thrown up for<br/>
war nearly [blank space] in the times of the Romans<br/>
being their military defences and capable of holding hundreds<br/>
of thousands of fighting men. These hills are altogether bare<br/>
of timber but covered with grass which is grazed by<br/>
sheep and asses. Several acres on the S. W. side is<br/>
covered with rabbit burrows from which you could see</p>",

Sangrain informed us that he had abandoned all<br/>

to our own recourses again. So we concluded to<br/>
proceed on our journey in our canoe. Embarking we<br/>
sailed twenty-four miles down the river to [[Petit Jean Mountain, Conway County, Arkansas Territory|Petty-John<br/>
Mountain]] w[h]ere we stoped for the night with a Mr</p>",
42828.0,203,,"<p>scores of rabbits running about the ground. But I soon with- <br/>
drew my thougths from the agile little creature that sported upon<br/>
the hills to the solemner reflections of the past called up by the<br/>
entrenchments of battlefields around which told of bloody conflicts<br/>
between the natives and their invaders when England was young<br/>
Offering up a prayer upon the summit of the Hill to Him who<br/>
will redeem the earth from the curse of sin and prepare it for<br/>
the abode of the Saints of the Most High I returned to the Vale<br/>
reflecting upon the rise progress decline and fall of the nations<br/>
and empires of the earth and of the revolutions which must<br/>
still transpire before the winding up scene and the coming<br/>
of Christ to reign</p>

<p>At candle light I preached at Brother<br/>
[[John Hallard|John Allard's]] at [[Wind Point, Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Wind Point]] and was endowed with the<br/>
Spirit of God. I baptized and confirmed four.</p>

<p>12th A member of the Wesle<strike>an</strike>yan Methodist<br/>
came to me to enquire what she should Do to be saved. I<br/>
answered in the words of Jesus that she must be born of<br/>
water and the spirit. She received my testimony and<br/>
wished me to baptize her. I also called upon a woman<br/>
who kept the Toll Gate at [[Chance|Chancy's Pitch]] and preached<br/>
the word unto her. She received it gladly and desired<br/>
baptism at my hands. I then called upon Mrs<br/>
[[Sarah Stanton|Sarah Stanton]] the house keeper of the splendid mansion<br/>
bearing the name of [[Brand Lodge, Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Brand Lodge]]. This lady was a<br/>
Wesleyan but she received my testimony and I administered<br/>
the ordinance of baptism to the three ladies refered to<br/>
above. I baptized them in a pond on the enclosed<br/>
grounds of Brand Lodge. I also confirmed them and then<br/>
walked to [[Keysend Street, Berrow, Worcestershire, England|Keys<strike>and</strike>end's Street]] and held a meeting with the Saints<br/>
experienced a good time and confirmed 19 persons.</p>

<p>It seemed as though some would worship<br/>
me while they cried out—""Here is a man of Zion— the<br/>
Man of God that we have so long looked for. Who is <br/>
worthy to receive him into their house."" I told them<br/>
to worship God for I was only his servant. I baptized<br/>
three and in all confirmed 22 on this the 12th day of May.</p>",

[START HERE] [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]] where I received two letters one from Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]]<br/>
and the other from [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parly P. Pratt]] after which I walked to<br/>
[[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standly Hill]] and had an interview with Priests [[John Cheese|Cheese]] and<br/>
[[James Barnes|Barnes]]. Brother Cheese had baptized 15 since I last<br/>
saw him: also Priest [[John Parry, b. 1799|John Parry]] had baptized 3 on<br/>
May the 3rd. (In his letter Elder Turley informed me<br/>
that he should be liberated from prison on the morrow)<br/>
Afterwards I walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] and baptized 3 and<br/>
met the Church in company of Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]. We<br/>
had a good meeting and broke bread with the Saints. We<br/>
also at this time ordained John Cheese to the office of Elder<br/>
[[William Parsons|William Parsons]] and [[Joseph Pulling|Joseph Pullen]] to the office of Priest<br/>
and [[Thomas Jenkins|Thomas Jenkins]] to that of Teacher. Besides these<br/>
we confirmed 9 souls and Elder Cheese baptized 2 and [[Thomas Henry Clark|Thomas<br/>

baptized one. I foun that Elders Richards and Kington<br/>
had baptized fifty confirmed 100<strike>0</strike> ordained ten Priests and<br/>

<p>But persecution had arisen to such an height that<br/>
about ten thousand souls of the Saints had been driven from<br/>
the State and the city of Far West almost made desolate and<br/>
waste. At the same time the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his council<br/>
with other Elders were in [[Liberty Jail, Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|prison]] and had been under the sentence<br/>
of death several times because of their religion and they would<br/>
have been put to death had not the Lord preserved them<br/>
their lives were in His hands and not at this time in the<br/>
hands of their enemies. Yet there were about thirty five of<br/>
the Church killed at this time among whom was [[David Wyman Patten|David W.<br/>
Patten]] of the Twelve Apostles.</p>

<p>These were the circumstances of that time<br/>
and moreover the Missourians had sworn that the revelation<br/>
above alluded to should not be fulfilled. Yet in spite of<br/>
all this we were now moving for<strike>th</strike>ward to the building spot of<br/>
the House of the Lord in the city of Far West. The sacred spot<br/>
was reached the Council held the revelation fulfilled and after<br/>
taking leave of the Saints we returned thirty two miles and<br/>
camped for the night.</p>

the mud and water but I had not gone far before I was taken with<br/>
such rheumatic pains in one of my knees that I could not travel<strike>l</strike><br/>
My companion, Elder [[Henry Brown|Brown]] was very anxious to make a speedy<br/>
journey to the river take a steamer up the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]] and hasten<br/>
to his friends in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. He therefore thought we had better<br/>
seperate as he could travel faster than I in my lame condition</p>

<p>I did not object to Elder Brown's proposition although I thought<br/>
that <u>I</u> should not have been willing to leave a lone companion in <br/>
the ministry in an open swamp without knowing whether he would<br/>
be able to walk far enough to meet again any companion more<br/>
acceptable than the wolves bears and alagators with which I was<br/>
surrounded</p>

<p>My fellow traveller left me sitting upon a log in the mud and<br/>
water without any food and twelve<strike>s</strike> miles to the nearest house on my<br/>
road. I gazed upon him as he hastened out of my sight, then<br/>
knelt down in the mud and water and prayed unto the Lord in the<br/>
name of Jesus Christ in faith that he would heal me and open my<br/>
way that I might continue on my journey. The Lord heard my<br/>
prayer: His Spirit descended upon me and I was healed. I arose,<br/>
went on my way rejoicing, and, after walking fourteen miles was<br/>
kindly received by Mr [[John Casber|John Cas<strike>p</strike>ber]]. At this place there was quite<br/>
a settlement and the people came together and filled the house.<br/>
I preached to them and bore a strong testimony of the [[work of God|work of<br/>
God]] revealed in our days.</p>

three miles upon me during the day; and in travelling those<br/>
in the evening he got lost in a thicket of brambles or Mohawk briars</p>",

in the name of the great God and according to the laws of<br/>
the land commanded order. Two of the brethren<br/>
went to the door to keep peace one of whom was Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
They were enabled to overcome the enemy and restore order<br/>
We administerd the Lord's supper and confirmed five.<br/>
We also ordained four Priests—namely, [[Thomas Brooks|Thomas Brooks]]<br/>

<p>A Feast Day With the Saints.</p>

<p>The 10th of May was an interesting day to me and<br/>
and my brethren who had come on the Lord's business from<br/>
our native land to establish the first ^<span class=""unclear"">[forein]</span>^ mission of the<br/>
Church in the nations of Europe. It had been a custom<br/>
of the United Brethren to hold ^the meeting^.</p>

<p>But they were now members of the Church of Latter<br/>
Day Saints and had received the fulness of the Gospel<br/>
and as such they continued their old custom by brotherhood<br/>
Accordingly Brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] formerly the presiding<br/>
minister and Superintendent of the Church of United<br/>
Brethren and now their Presiding Elder as a part of the<br/>
Church of Latter-day Saints on this day once more prepared<br/>
a temporal feast for his flock.</p>

two of whom were Churchmen and the other a Wesleyan<br/>
from thence we walked to [[William Hart|William Hart's]]</p>

<p>Elder Kington baptized seven<br/>
and Elders Brigham Young and Willard Richards<br/>
confirmed them. In a few minutes I baptized five<br/>
more who were confirmed as they came out of the water<br/>

also desired to be baptized. Elder Kington baptized</p>",

[[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi River]] crossed the ferry and walked into the<br/>
city of [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]] a stranger and alone—weary hungry and<br/>
without money—my clothing rough dirty and nearly<br/>
ragged, having walked through so much swamp water<br/>
and brush. But in this situation I called at one of the<br/>
most respestable taverns in the city kept by a Mr [[Josiah Jackson|Jackson]]<br/>
between whom and myself the following dialogue took<br/>
place:</p>

<p><u>Myself</u>: Sir I am a servant of God—a preacher of the ^Gospel^<br/>
and without purse or scrip—Will you entertain<br/>
me for the night?</p>

<p><u>Jackson</u>: How do I know sir but what you are an impostor?<br/>
You don't look much like a preacher. What<br/>
denomination are you of?</p>

<p><u>Myself</u>: I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ<br/>
of Latter-day Saints. It is true you do not<br/>
know but that I am an impostor; but I can<br/>
show you my licence and recomendation.</p>

<p><u>Jackson</u>: How do I know but you forged them?</p>

<p><u>Myself</u>: You do not and if you are not willing to take<br/>
my word for it I will go my way and try elsewhere.</p>

<p><u>Jackson</u>: No sir y[ou] cannot go. Give me your valise. I<br/>
will keep you for the night and get you a<br/>
congregation and you must preach to us in<br/>
order to prove whether you are an impostor<br/>
or not.""</p>

<p>By this time I found that Mr Jackson really beleived that<br/>
I was an impostor. I was alone yet must confess that I<br/>
felt somewhat mischevious. I feigned to appear as though<br/>
I was frightened and not wish to be put to the test: at which<br/>
Mr J. grew excited and I saw that he was in for fun. It</p>",
42828.0,206,,"<p>her. The Saints began to gather at 2 o'clock and by 5 p.m.<br/>
we had nearly one hundred Saints together to the feast prepared<br/>
for them. We had indeed that day a most interesting<br/>
and spiritual time as well as <strike>our</strike> social communion<br/>
in temporal things. Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] first addressed<br/>
the Saints and was clothed with the Spirit and power of<br/>
God. He then asked a blessing upon the food so<br/>
bountifully prepared. We then sat down to the table<br/>
and eat and drank with nearly one hundred Saints<br/>
who possessed glad hearts and cheerful countenances<br/>
Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]] remarked that he did not beleive that<br/>
there had ever been such a company of Saints prepared<br/>
in so short a time and who bid fairer for the <br/>
Kingdom of Heaven then the company then assembled<br/>
at least since the Church of Latter-Day Saints was<br/>
first organized.</p>

<p><b>A Church of Four Hundred<br/>
Raised up By Me<br/>
In Two Months &amp; a Half</b></p>

<p>I trurly felt grateful to my Heavenly Father when<br/>
I reflected back upon the time when I first proclamed<br/>
the fulness of the Gospel in this region, and began<br/>
to baptize such as received my testimony. Only two<br/>
months and a half a go since I came into the [[Herefordshire Beacon, Herefordshire, England|Hertfordshire]]<br/>
field of labour and now there was a Church raised ^up^ of nearly<br/>
four hundred souls and the prospect of the work constantly<br/>
increasing.</p>

<p>After our feasting was over the<br/>
house was called to order by Elder Brigham ^Young^ who then<br/>
delivered a short address after which three were confirmed<br/>
by myself and Elder Willard Richards. There were also<br/>
ordained to the office of Elder [[Daniel Browett|Daniel Browett]] and to<br/>
the office of Priest [[John Sivel Smith|John Smith]] [[John Davis|John Davis]] [[James George Morgan|James Morgan]]<br/>

commenced our journey from the Grove in upper Missouri where<br/>
we had returned and camped the night before. This was<br/>
32 miles from the city of Far West.</p>

<p>The company with us consisted of seven of the<br/>
Twelve, a number of the committee, and several other familes</p>",
42828.0,67,,"<p>suited my purpose for matters to take this turn for I was desirous to preach<br/>
to the people.</p>

<p>They sat me a table in a large hall and gave me a good supper<br/>
<strike>and large</strike> Mr [[Josiah Jackson|Jackson]] went into the town immediately and gave notice<br/>
to a certain class to come to his house and hear an impostor<br/>
preach and before I had finished my supper the room began<br/>
to be crowded with men in broad-cloth and ladies in silks<br/>
and satins.</p>

<p>As soon as I had done my meal the table departed<br/>
over <s>my</s>the heads of the people. My host gave me a chair in<br/>
the corner of the room and placed a stand before me with<br/>
a Bible and a hymn-book upon it. About a dozen of the<br/>
company formed a circle in front of me; and I saw by the<br/>
countenances of the people that they expected some fun.</p>

<p>Commencing my meeting by reading a hymn I asked the<br/>
congregation to sing; but no one sang. I then knelt down and<br/>
prayed and the men in front of me all droped upon their knees.<br/>
When I arose I read the ##Romans 11|11th ch. of Romans## and preached from<br/>
the ##Romans 11:21|21st## verse: ""For if God spared not the natural branches,<br/>
take heed lest he also spare not thee""</p>

<p>I spent but a very few minutes in discourse about the<br/>
Jews but turned to the assembly before me and as the [[spirit of God|Spirit<br/>
of God]] rested upon me and revealed to my understanding the<br/>
wickedness of their hearts I poured it out upon them telling<br/>
them of their wickedness whoredoms and abominations in very<br/>
plain terms. I suppose they never had their sins so plainly<br/>
pointed out before. The men in front of me dropped their<br/>
heads in the early part of my discourse and I could not catch<br/>
their eyes afterwards. Having thoroughly satisfied my mind<br/>
and spoken about an hour and an half I closed the meeting<br/>
and not a word was spoken by any one. The room was instantly<br/>
cleared. In two minutes I was left alone and soon after the<br/>
landlady came in and lit me to bed.</p>

<p>I had not been in bed more than an hour before a crowd<br/>
of men who had attended the meeting collected in a room adjoining<br/>
mine and discussed the subject of my being an impostor or not<br/>
and also my sermon. Their decision was that I was not an<br/>
impostor and it puzzled them much to understand how I should<br/>
know so fully of their sins for I had told them much of which<br/>
they were guilty. The subject was discussed until near midnight</p>",
42828.0,207,,"<p>After our meeting was closed three more were baptized<br/>
The ordinance of baptism was administered by Priest<br/>
[[James George Morgan|James Morgan]] who was baptized confirmed and ordained<br/>
on that ^day^ and now officiated in one of the ordinances of<br/>
the Church. There was baptized and confirmed in all<br/>
<strike>that day</strike> nineteen and ordained one Elder and six Priests</p>

<p>On the following day Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
and myself went to [[Keysend Street, Berrow, Worcestershire, England|Keysend Street]] where brother Young<br/>
preached and after the meeting I baptized four who were<br/>
confirmed by Elders Young and Richards as they came out<br/>
of the water.</p>

<p>May the 20th we walked to [[Wind Point, Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Wind Point]] and<br/>
brothers Young Richards and myself went on to the top of that<br/>
part of [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]] called [[Herefordshire Beacon, Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire Beacon]]. Here we <br/>
united in prayer</p>

<p><b>And Held A Council.</b></p>

<p>We jointly felt that it was the will of God that Elder Brigham<br/>
Young should immediately go to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] to assist<br/>
in publishing a</p>

<p><b>Collection of Hymn^s^ <strike>Books</strike><br/>
Of 3000 Copies.</b></p>

<p>and also to immediately print and publish</p>

<p><b>Three Thousand Copies of the Book of Mormon</b></p>

<p>for we had procured three hundred pounds for this purpose<br/>
^donated from [[John Benbow|John Benbow]]^ and was anxious to have this book of God circulated<br/>
and the knowledge of the great work connected with its coming<br/>
forth published to all nations.</p>

<p>Returning to the Vale from the Hill we<br/>
took the parting hand of Brigham Young who star<strike>d</strike>ted for<br/>
Manchester while Elder Richards and myself tarried and<br/>
preached at Wind Point; he baptized two and confirmed <br/>
one and I the other. I also ordained [[John Hallard|John Allard]] to the office<br/>
of Teacher.</p>

have their beloved Prophet with them again. During the day</p>",

at the house of brother [[Cade A. Crawley|Cade Crawley]] in [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphry's County]]<br/>
He was the first Saint whom I had met in [[Tennessee|Tennessee]].</p>",

the Valley Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]] baptized two persons We preached<br/>
at [[Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Colwall]] that evening and there was also ordaind by us<br/>
on this day three Priests</p>

<p>On the 22nd I went over [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]]<br/>
with Brother Richards and had a splendid view of the Vale<br/>
beneath. We stoped at the resting house half way down<br/>
the hill and brother Richards engraved his name with<br/>
mine in the building. We went into the Valley and<br/>
dined after which we walked up to the Holy Well House<br/>
and drank of the Holy Water of great note which comes<br/>
out of Malvern Hill. After visiting several friends east<br/>
of the Hill we ascended to the top of [[Great Malvern, Worcestershire, England|Great Malvern]] which<br/>
is the highest peak of any part of the hill. Here we could<br/>
overlook all the hills and surrounding country. We bowed<br/>
down and offered up prayer unto God and then walked down<br/>
<strike>by</strike> the west side and preached at Malvern Hill town<br/>
We then walked to brother [[Thomas Jenkins|Jinkins]] at [[Moorends Cross, Malton, Worcestershire, England|Moorend's Cross]]<br/>
where we spent that night and the next day and blessed<br/>
the family of our worthy brother and host.</p>

<p>Sunday the 24th I walked to [[Old Storridge Common, Alfrick, Worcestershire, England|Old<br/>
Starridge Common]] to attend a Camp Meeting. I preached<br/>
in the morning and brother Willard Richards in the<br/>
evening after which we broke bread with the Saints<br/>
Three were baptized by me and we ordained three<br/>
Priests and one teacher.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in looking<br/>
up the aged and infirm and we baptized as many<br/>
as would receive our testimony. I baptized six and<br/>
brother Richards confirmed them one of whom was<br/>
eighty years of age. We also preached at [[Dunns Close, Herefordshire, England|Dunn's Closs]]<br/>
and the next day at [[Bishops Frome, Herefordshire, England|Bishops Froome]]</p>

a blessing after which we walked to [[Stokes Lane, Herefordshire, England|Stokes Lane]] and<br/>
preached, confirmed ten persons into the church and<br/>
ordained two Priests and one Teacher and on the <br/>

42828.0,161,,""">6th of May</time> I met with the Quorum of<br/>

<p>After this I with the Twelve and Bishops met<br/>
brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] at the house of Bishoph [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] where we again<br/>
had an interesting time. This ended the Conference.</p>

<p>Several brethren who attended this conference<br/>
had been wounded by the Missourian mob. I will here<br/>
relate<br/>
<u><b>A Remarkable Incident of the Persecution</b></u></p>

<p>Brother [[Isaac Laney|Isaac Leany]] was in company with about<br/>
20 others at <b>[[Haun|Hawn's Mills]]</b> in upper [[Missouri|Missouri]] when a large<br/>
armed mob fell upon them with loaded rifles and other<br/>
weapons and shot down seventeen of the Saints and murdered<br/>
them in cold blood.</p>

<p>Brother Leany fled from the scene for life and<br/>
while fleeing the mob poured forth a shower of balls upon him<br/>
which pierced his body through and through. He showed<br/>
me eleven holes in his body and there w<s>as</s>ere 27 in his shirt<br/>
7 in his pantaloons and his coat was literally cut to rags.<br/>
One ball entered his body at one arm pit and came out at<br/>
the other; another ball entered the back and came out of the<br/>
breast and balls passed through each hip each leg and each<br/>
arm. All th<s>i</s>ese w<s>as</s>ere received while runing for life.</p>

<p>Strange in fact miraculous as it was all these<br/>
wounds with the addition of a broken rib from one of the balls <br/>
yet the speed of this brother was not lessened but he entirely<br/>
out-run his pursuers and saved his life.</p>

<p>This is as remarkable a case as ever recorded in<br/>
history of a man being literally riddled with balls besides having<br/>
his clothes almost cut to rags on his back with the shower of<br/>
lead and yet to outrun his pursuers and save his life just as<br/>
though only a few pees had been showered after him. He <br/>
was at this Conference now; and we can only acknowledge his<br/>
miraculous preservation to be by the [[power of God|power]] and mercy of God.</p>",
42828.0,69,,""">23rd of June</time> we received a letter from [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver<br/>
Cowdery]] containing a request for Elder Parrish to return to<br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] as he was one of the Seventies chosen. He also<br/>
stated that it was wisdom for me to remain in the South and<br/>
to take charge of the Churches which we had raised up. I<br/>
was instructed to labor in great humility and told that I<br/>
should lose nothing as there were other Seventies to be chosen<br/>
and that I should be remembered.</p>

<p>My Autobiography is not about to branch into my ordination<br/>
to the office of Elder and to take in an account of my labors<br/>
while holding that office. I will therefore close this chapter by<br/>
subjoining the following synopsis:</p>

<p><u><b>Synopsis of My Travels, Etc.</b></u></p>

<p>Travels As A Teacher:</p>

<p>I travelled while holding the office of Teacher from the 11th of April 1834<br/>

42828.0,209,,"<p>by Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]]. We then walked to [[Hope|Hope Rush]] and preached<br/>
when I baptized five more who were also confirmed by<br/>
brother Richards</p>

<p>On this day we visited the greatest curiosity<br/>
of Evergreen known in [[Europe|Europe]] or in any part of the world<br/>
so far as I can learn. This Evergreen was upon the farm<br/>
known as hopton in the Hole in the Parish of [[Much Cowarne, Herefordshire, England|Much Cowen<br/>
Herefordshire]] and owned by [[Richard Gardner|Richard Gardner]]. It was in a<br/>
circular form inclosing about one acre composed of Yew trees<br/>
growing out and standing in the midst of a border of Box<br/>
<strike>B</strike>brush. The yew trees were about in the form of a high<br/>
and well built hay or wheat stack and were suposed to be<br/>
several hundred years old. This Evergreen was surrounded by<br/>
a canal of water.</p>

<p>Our labours of the following day commenced<br/>
with my baptizing two at the creek who were confirmed by<br/>
Elder Richards and then we walked to [[Shucknall Hill, Herefordshire, England|Sucknell Hill]] and<br/>
preached after which I baptized three more one of whom was<br/>
a preacher and ordained one Priest</p>

<p>Next day Elder Richards baptized two<br/>
whom I confirmed and then we walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]]<br/>
to spend the night at brother [[John Benbow|Benbow's]]. Elder Richards<br/>
and myself had retired to rest for the night when brother<br/>
[[John Fidoe|John Fidoe]] came in and brought us six letters three of which<br/>
were for myself. One of these were from [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]<br/>
[[Georgetown, Essex County, Massachusetts|George Town]] Massachusetts and another from my wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]<br/>
[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] Lee Co. Iowa. This was the first letter which I<br/>
had received from my wife since my arrival in [[England|England]]<br/>
Her letter contained much interesting news to me. She<br/>
informed me of</p>

He also fled and though the balls fell around him like hail<br/>
stones yet was he delivered also.<br/>

<p>Introductory Remarks.</p>

<p>In continuing th<strike>y</strike>e embodiment of my Journals in the form<br/>
of history I do not design to make it a mere diary. In<br/>
describing my journey and the incidents thereof I followed<br/>
a consecutive daily detail and shall adopt the same form<br/>
at times hereafter when it appears most suitable but as in<br/>
general one days record must be very similar to those<br/>
of many days so as a general rule I shall not follow a<br/>
diary form. My journals will show that as a rule<br/>
every day was spent in the active performance of<br/>
ministerial duties in daily travels and daily preaching<br/>
from place to place. I shall only note in this history<br/>
that which contains some leading incident or which has<br/>
a variation worthy of notice.</p>",

<p>Another of the letters was from Sister [[Jennetta Richards Richards|Richards]] and one<br/>
also from Elder [[James Whitehead|Whitehead]] and there was so much glorious <br/>
news that sleep was driven from our eyes for the night. I <br/>
felt more like shouting Hallelujah.</p>

<p>According to appointment Sunday the<br/>
31<sup>st</sup> of May we attended a Camp Meeting at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]]<br/>
when I preached in the morning on the authenticity of<br/>
the Book of Mormon after which we went to the pool<br/>
where I baptized 12 and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] confirmed<br/>
them at the water's side. Elder Richards preached in the <br/>
afternoon <strike>when</strike> when we administered bread and wine to <br/>
the Saints and then about one hundred of us went to<br/>
the water <strike>when</strike> ^where^ two more were baptized by Elder [[John Cheese|Cheese]].<br/>
Two of those baptized this day were preachers.</p>

[[Hawcross, Redmarley D|Haw Cross]] and on the Sunday according to appointment I met a<br/>
congregation at Coars lawn and held a camp meeting. There was<br/>
a large congregation of various denominations <strike>A</strike>after thee meeting<br/>
we repaired to a house and broke bread. Eight were confirmed<br/>
and one baptized by Bro [[John Spiers|Spires]].</p>

<p>The next day I walked to [[Deerhurst, Gloucestershire, England|Deerhurst]] and preached<br/>
and at night I dreamed I saw a large Church on fire. The steple<br/>
which was high was in flames. Several men were in the belfry<br/>
trying to save some part of the building with ropes pullies and <br/>
chains but they were soon obliged to flee for their lives and <br/>
much of the surrounding country was on fire. I dreamt that<br/>
I was on a large horse and rode out of the way.</p>

<p>On the 9th I attended the funeral of brother<br/>
[[Nathan Roberts|Nathan Roberts]]. I sung a hymn and prayed before the body<br/>
was conveyed to the grave. I bless^ed^ the children of the widow<br/>
and endeavoured to comfort her. I also baptized six and<br/>
confirmed them blessed eleven children and laid hands on<br/>
four for the healing of the sick Afterwards I walked from<br/>
Deerhurst to [[Apperley, Gloucestershire, England|Apperly]] and preached and on the next two<br/>
days preached at several places and baptized one and blessed a <br/>
number of children.</p>

<p>June 12th I walked to [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] and<br/>
had an interview with Elder Richards who had just returned<br/>

<p>The Prophet said that when an angel of God<br/>

been a hard storm of rain which had swollen the<br/>

council of the Priesthood should be held alternately on the<br/>
south and North sides of the [[River Severn, England|River Severn]] to commence at<br/>
[[Leigh, Gloucestershire, England|Leigh]] on the 26th of June and organized the same by appointing<br/>
Elder Daniel Browett President and [[John Hill|John Hill]] clerk of these<br/>

his Council came across the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] to Montrose to spend the day<br/>
with the Twelve to bless them and their families before they<br/>

down the river to see the place called Blesens-point where the<br/>

where we preached and had an interesting time. Elder<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] spoke from the text ""If the Lord be God<br/>
serve Him."" The power of the Priesthood rested upon him<br/>
and the principles of eternal truth were presented so plain that no<br/>
opposing power could ^with^stand them. After he closed I arose and<br/>
bore my testimony to what the congregation had heard</p>

<p>The church minister of the parish had<br/>
sent ^his curdle^ a spy to our meeting to carry him word concerning<br/>
what was preached. As soon as the meeting closed<br/>
I put my hand upon his shoulder and asked him<br/>
what he thought of our doctrine and he replied ""I<br/>
think it is of God."" He appeared astonished when<br/>
he left the house. Almost every person with whom<br/>
I conversed said that they wished to be baptized<br/>
as soon as an opportunity offered. Several were<br/>
baptized by Elder [[Philip Green|Green]] after their return home<br/>
and one after the meeting by Priest [[Benjamin Williams|Williams]].</p>

<p>We had baptized on this day<br/>
six persons and confirmed them ordained two Priests<br/>
blessed thirteen children and healed two who were sick<br/>
The night was spent at brother Williams.</p>

<p>On the morning of the following<br/>
day I arose early and baptized and confirmed one<br/>
and a number of others soon came to us and requested<br/>
to be baptized</p>

<p>We immediately walked to the [[River Lugg, Herefordshire, England|River<br/>
Lug]] but being hindered for a short time in looking <br/>
for a place suitable for the purpose a man by the<br/>
name of Pitt ^came^ up to us filled with the devil and at<br/>
the head of a mob and commanded us not to<br/>
baptize in that river and threatened us much if we<br/>
did so. Elder Richards preached to him and warned<br/>
him to repent but the Devil raged so much in him<br/>
and his company that we deemed it wise to postpone<br/>
the administration of the ordinance</p>

upon our mission and many souls as seals of our ministry.</p>

<p>Brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] afterwards gave us<br/>
some beneficial counsel relative to our mission and advised<br/>
as best to only preach the [[first principles of the gospel|first principles of the Gospel]]</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] then arose and gave to us some<br/>
of the precious things of the Kingdom in the power of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy<br/>
Ghost]]. He said in substance what I here record in<br/>
the following synopsis of<br/>
<b><u>Joseph's Charge to the Twelve!!</u></b></p>

<p>""Ever keep in exercise the principles of mercy<br/>
and be ready to forgive your broth<s>er</s>ren on the first signs<br/>
of repentance and his asking forgiveness; and should we<br/>
even forgive our brother or our enemy before he ask it our<br/>
[[Heavenly Father|Heavenly Father]] will he equally as merciful unto us. We<br/>
ought also to be willing to confess all our sins and keep<br/>
nothing back.</p>

<p>Let the Twelve be humble and not be<br/>
exaulted and beware of pride. Seek not to exalt yourselves<br/>
one above another nor to excel one another but act for <br/>
each other's good. We should honorably make mention of<br/>
each other's name in our prayers before the Lord and before<br/>
our fellow men and not backbite and devour our brother.</p>

<p>Why will not man learn wisdom from<br/>
precept and example? Why at this late age of the world<br/>
must we be obliged to learn everything we know by sad<br/>
experience?</p>

<p>Must the new ones who are chosen to fill<br/>
the places of those who are fallen of the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
begin to exalt themselves until they get so high as to tumble<br/>
over and have a great fall? Must they do so and afterwards<br/>
go wallowing through the mire and be left in darkness &amp; [[Judas (NT)|Judas]]<br/>
like be delivered to the buffatings of Satan as several of the<br/>
Twelve before? Or will they learn wisdom from experience<br/>
and be wise? O God give them wisdom and keep them <br/>
humble I pray!</p>",

day for we had much buisness to attend to. Among<br/>
the duties of this day I baptized eight persons and<br/>
we confirmed fourteen administered to the sick and<br/>
blessed three children. The power of God was in the<br/>

Jesus Christ stand before the congregations of the earth and preach<br/>
in power and demonstration of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] and the people<br/>
are astonished and confounded at the doctrine and shall say that<br/>
man has preached a powerful discourse—a great sermon, then<br/>
let that man or those men take care that they do not ascribe the<br/>
glory unto themselves but be careful that they are humble and<br/>
ascribe the praise and glory to God and the [[Lamb of God|Lamb]] for it is<br/>
by the power of the [[Holy Priesthood|Holy Priesthood]] and the Holy Ghost that<br/>
they have the power thus to speak.</p>

<p>What art though O man but dust and from<br/>
whom dost thou receive thy power and blessing but from<br/>
God! Then O ye Twelve notice this key and be wise for<br/>
Christ sake and your own souls sake.</p>

<p>Ye are not sent out to be taught but to teach.<br/>
Let every man be sober and vigilent and let all his words be<br/>
seasened with grace. Keep in mind also that it is a day of warning<br/>
and not of many words.</p>

<p>Act honestly before God and beware of Gentile<br/>
sophestry such as bowing and scraping unto men in whom you<br/>
have no confidence. Be honest open and frank in all your<br/>
intercourse with mankind.</p>

<p>And O ye Twelve and all Saints profit by<br/>
this important key which [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] now give you: In all your trials<br/>
troubles <strike>and</strike> temptations afflictions bonds imprisonment and death<br/>
see to it that you do not betray heaven that you do not<br/>
betray Jesus Christ that you do not betray your brethren and<br/>
that you do not betray the revelations of God whether in the<br/>
Bible [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and Covenants]] or any of the <br/>
[[word of God|word of God]]. Yea in all your kickings and flounderings<br/>
see to it that you do not this thing lest inocent blood be found<br/>
in your skirts and you go down to hell!</p>

<p>We may ever know <strike>by</strike>that there is danger of<br/>
our being led to a fall and [[apostasy|apostacy]] when we give way to the<br/>

Elder [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] was speaking. He occupied the stand<br/>
in the fore-part of the day and spoke much of the proof of<br/>

I followed and afterwards [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] then addressed us with remarks peculiarly<br/>
adapted to the circumstances of the Twelve taking their<br/>
departure from all they held dear on earth to go to other<br/>
nations to bear the testimony of God's work and revelation of<br/>
the [[last days|last days]]. His appeal to our affections was <strike>so</strike> powerful<br/>
touching our parting from our wives and children the<br/>
trying circumstances that surrounded our families the perils<br/>
that we might meet and the blessings we should receive &amp;c.<br/>
Tears were brought from many an eye while he addressed us</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] then spoke to us a few words<br/>

Joseph has been imprisoned before you; if you are<br/>
placed where you can <strike>only</strike> see your brethren only through<br/>
the grates of a window while in irons because of the Gospel<br/>

of the Second Seventies. My ordination was requested by<br/>
the Presidency of the Church at Kirtland. There were<br/>
glorious things pronounced upon my head by the [[spirit of prophecy|Spirit of<br/>
prophecy]] and [[spirit of revelation|revelation]]. It was said that my enemies would<br/>
strive to take my life but that God would deliver me out of<br/>
their hands; that the Lord would give me the desire of my<br/>
heart and that his eye had been upon me all my life long<br/>
to prepare me for this work; that I should travel to the nations<br/>
of the earth and the Islands of the sea to proclaim the [[word of God|word of <br/>

had an interview during the evening with a Mr Adams who<br/>
had been a constant companion of my brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] for several<br/>

of the strictness of his principles. He said Asahel got along well in<br/>
his business until the last year of his life. He bought a large<br/>
quantity of books and they did not sell as well as he expected<br/>

bered in consequence of the prospect of the fulfilment of the words<br/>
of the ancient Prophets who testify of the great events of the last<br/>
days especially the gathering of Israel.</p>

<p>The time had now arrived when some of the Saints of God<br/>
in the South began to take their families their carriages wagons<br/>
oxen horses tents arms &amp;c and move towards Zion as the [[children of Israel|children<br/>

of baptism and he was confirmed upon the bank</p>

<p>The ceremony concluded we took the parting hand<br/>
of those beloved servants of God who with sister [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|Patten]] set off<br/>
towards Zion to be followed by others on the same day<br/>
with ox teams.</p>

<p>After spending a short time in arranging the<br/>
wagons and teams the company was prepared to move forward<br/>
It consisted of four families; including three Elders in the<br/>
camp. The families were these: [[Lewis Clapp|Lewis Clapp]] and family<br/>
[[John Camp|John Camp]] and family [[Albert Petty|Albert Petty]] and family and Elder<br/>
Benjamin Clapp and family; also Elders [[Benjamin Boydston|Boydstun]] and<br/>

leader in their journey Zionward.</p>

<p>The company consisted of males 6 females 5, children 10<br/>
and one servant making in all twenty-two. They were principally<br/>
the first fruits of my ministry.</p>

<p>After bidding adiu to their friends they moved<br/>
forward on their journey in good spirits and with joy I rode<br/>
with them on their first day's travel as far as the Southfork<br/>
of [[Mayfield, Graves County, Kentucky|Mayfield]] w[h]ere we camped for the night.</p>

I never before had left a field of labour with as much<br/>
satisfaction and I felt to render up unto God the gratitude<br/>
of my heart for giving me so many souls as seals to my<br/>
ministry and I noted in my journal of that day the remarkable<br/>
fact that I had been led by the Spirit (a little over a quarter<br/>
of a year before) through a densely populated country for<br/>
eighty miles and chose no part of it for my field of labour<br/>
until I was led by the Lord to the house of [[John Benbow|John Benbow]]<br/>
at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] where I preached for the first time on the<br/>
5th of March. Now on the 22nd of June I was journing<br/>
to the Manchester Conference where will be represented<br/>
this fruitful field of my labours with thirty three organized<br/>
Churches numbering five hundred and forty one members<br/>
three hundred of whom received the ordinance of baptism<br/>
under my own hands</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] laboured with<br/>
me in this vineyard about one month from whom I and<br/>
the Saints received much benefit for he is mighty<br/>
in council and endowed with much wisdom.<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] had laboured with me two months<br/>
and was also a great blessing to us for he had<br/>
passed through a great school of experience and learnt<br/>
much wisdom and his sound judgement was very manifest<br/>

sat together.</p>

a distance of eight miles where we spent the night and<br/>
baptized one.</p>

and myself took coach to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] and thence to<br/>

Elder Taylor felt much better and we concluded to spend the day<br/>
in the place and preach to the people. It was a German<br/>
settlement. I delivered a discourse on the [[first principles of the gospel|first principles<br/>
of the Gospel]] and other subjects. Brother Taylor followed and<br/>
spoke until he was quite exhausted not realizing his bodily<br/>
weakness. I became chilled myself and we returned to the<br/>
inn where we stoped when I was immediately taken with<br/>
the ague followed with high fever which lasted most of the<br/>
night.</p>

<p>The next day Elder Taylor was worse and had a<br/>
high bilious fever and could not continue his journey. It was<br/>
now evident that brother Taylor would have to be left behind<br/>
It was painful to think of parting from him and to leave<br/>
him sick nor should I have done so had I been able to<br/>
take care of him myself but this my health would not permit</p>

<p>Elder Taylor advised me to continue my<br/>
journey with Father [[John Coltrin|Coltrin]] and make the best of my way<br/>
to [[New York|New York]] and I accordingly concluded to take his<br/>
advise.</p>

<p>After committing my companion in the<br/>
ministry into the [[hands of God|hands of God]] I parted from him in<br/>
[[Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]] Wayne Co. Indianna leaving him in the hands<br/>
of our Divine Master on whose work we were and in<br/>
the care of a kind and benevolent family who promised<br/>
to do everything in their power to make him comfortable<br/>
until his recovery of which I had full confidence and<br/>
faith that the friends who promised to care for him<br/>
would keep their word.</p>

out of the State of [[Indiana|Indianna]] into the State of [[Ohio|Ohio]] and<br/>
passed through the town of [[Eaton, Preble County, Ohio|Eaton]] on our way where my<br/>

accompanied me to brother [[John Robinson|John Robinson's]] [[Greets Green, Staffordshire, England|Gritts Green]] near [[West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England|Bromwich]] when<br/>
I learned that Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] had gone to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]. I wrote to<br/>
him to return and see me</p>

<p>I had not been in the house but a short time<br/>
before two men came in full of wrath and brought a little blind<br/>
girl and demanded of me to heal her and work a miracle that they <br/>
might have a sign. After telling them the character of those who<br/>
sought for signs one of them brought a railing accusation against<br/>
me and rejected my testimony. Brother Turley had been preaching<br/>
at this place for three weeks and had baptized nine persons. During<br/>
the evening several came to inquire into the work and four offered<br/>
themselves for baptism. I spent the night at [[George Murrall|George Morrall's]]</p>

<p>Next day I met Elder Turley and was happy<br/>
to see him. He read a letter to me which he had received<br/>
from his wife containing much interesting matter to me. <br/>
He informed me among other items that Elders [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and<br/>
[[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] were set apart at the general conference by the Prophet<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] on the 6th of April to go to [[Jerusalem|Jereusalem]] and that they would<br/>
visit [[England|England]] on their way. The letter from sister [[Frances Kimberley Turley|Turley]]<br/>
also stated that sister [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] was at the conference and was<br/>
in good health. I preached that night at the house of Bro. <br/>
[[William Walker|Walker]] and four were baptized by Elder Turley.</p>

<p>The day following was also spent at<br/>
[[West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England|West Bromich]] and preached in the evening when another was<br/>
baptized and we ordained one priest and one teacher</p>

<p>So also was the 25 spent at the same<br/>

and Wolverhampton. The whole county arround was<br/>

description of the lake of fire and brimstone as that scene<br/>

I had suffered with the chills and fever almost daily for<br/>
about 15 days and to undertake to preach a sermon in<br/>
my weak state and at the very hour my ague usually<br/>
came on required much resolution and faith. However<br/>
I promised to go and gave out the appointment. It was<br/>
a chilly day. I rode in company with my step-mother<br/>
and sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] to [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] three miles from Farmington.</p>

<p>Arriving at the house of uncle Adna<br/>
the neighbours soon began to assemble and I had the<br/>
pleasure of meeting many friends whom I had not seen</p>",

and my feelings and impressions upon visiting <strike>and</strike> ^the^ city and [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] as<br/>
written by me at that date.</p>

<p>The Temple of the Lord came in sight (first in importance<br/>
to our view) before we reached [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. I truly rejo<strike>y</strike>^i^ced as the<br/>
House of the Lord rose in the view as we drew near this stake<br/>
of Zion. It was the first time that I had seen the Temple<br/>
built by the commandment of God in this generation</p>

<p>We soon entered the place and I spent one of the most<br/>
interesting and happy days of my life. The day was occup<strike>p</strike>ied in<br/>
looking around Kirtland visiting the Temple and calling on the<br/>
Elders and Presidents of the Church</p>

<p>After a seperation of two years and a half I was much<br/>
rejo<strike>y</strike>iced to strike hands with the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] again and also<br/>
of many others of the beloved ones engaged in rolling on the<br/>
mighty work of God and of Israel. Among the rest I had<br/>
the privilege of again meeting with Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] and<br/>
becoming acquainted with his companion and [[Martha H. Raymond Parrish|wife]]. This gave<br/>
me much pleasure; for there is a joy in meeting our brethren<br/>
and companions in tribulations that the world knows not of<br/>
because it flows from a celestial source.</p>

<p>I spent a short time in conversing with my friends<br/>
and then a more important scene opened to my view than ever<br/>
kings saw in this generation. It was that of the Temple of<br/>
Israel's God. Our visit to that holy house was to us the<br/>
crow[n]ing event of the day. I was accompanied by brothers<br/>
[[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] and Parrish. Each ap<strike>p</strike>artment of the Temple was<br/>
visited in turn. When we crossed the thresho[l]d of the house<br/>
and passed into the lower room great solemnity amounting almost<br/>
to a feeling of awe came over me for I felt indeed that my<br/>
<strike>my</strike> footsteps were in the Temple of the Lord of Host^s^.</p>

<p>Having walked into the pulpits e<strike>r</strike>rected for the Priesthoods<br/>
and viewed the curtains we as<strike>s</strike>cended into the upper rooms. And<br/>
as we passed from view to view scenes met our eyes showing<br/>
the grandeur solemnity and order that nothing short of wisdom<br/>
from God could design</p>

<p>In the upper rooms we saw four Egyptian mumies<br/>
and the Book of ##Abraham|Abraham## written by his own<br/>

truly to rejoice to once mmore meet the Saints in this region<br/>
We had an interview with Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] and preached at Stoke<br/>
where we spent the night</p>

<p>The next day I met Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A<br/>

President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and on the following being Sunday<br/>
we held a camp meeting at Stoke</p>

the day.</p>

42828.0,86,,"<p>my eyes around upon the pulpits arranged in order for the High<br/>
Priests. I beheld the Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith sen]] standing in<br/>
the upper pulpit and the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and Elder [[Jared Carter|Carter]]<br/>
in the second one. In the third Elders [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson <br/>
Pratt]] and [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] were seated. Soon Elder Carter<br/>
arose and opened the meeting and then preached and<br/>
then came a discourse from the Prophet Joseph.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I was called into the Stand<br/>
in company with Elder [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]]. I commenced by<br/>
prayer and then opened the Bible at random at the<br/>
##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah##.</p>

<p>As there is something remarkable connected<br/>
with my turning to this chapter which seems to be<br/>
more than mere chance I will here give a page of <br/>
reminiscences of an earlier period of my life and before<br/>
I heard the Gospel. Indeed this I did on the occasion<br/>
of my first preaching in the House of the Lord on this<br/>
same afternoon of the Sa^b^bath of which I am writing<br/>
This page of reminiscences which I then related to the<br/>
congregation and which I shall here write was called<br/>
forth by the chapter in question and the scene before all<br/>
of which I looked upon as fulfilment of Divine promises<br/>
made to me by the Spirit years prior to this date.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of my life my mind had<br/>
been much exercised for several years concerning the<br/>
true Church and Kingdom of God for I did not beleive<br/>
that it existed in its true organization upon the earth<br/>
The growth of such ideas in my mind was doubtless<br/>
strengthened much and more or less ingendered there by the<br/>
teachings of an old Prophet by name [[Robert Mason|Mason]] of whom<br/>
I have spoken in [blank]</p>

<p>At the time to which I refer I had pled much<br/>
with the Lord in secret to lead me right. In the year<br/>
1830 I tended a flower mill in [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]] Ct. and during<br/>
this year there were great revivals in that town. The church<br/>
of Pres [blank] held protracted meetings ranging from three to<br/>
twenty <strike>daily</strike> ^days^. I attended some of them and had the privilege<br/>
of speaking my feelings to the people. They seemed frequently</p>",

Gospel to that distant colony sixteen thousand miles from his<br/>
native land.</p>

<p>July th 7th I met with the Twelve and a number<br/>
of the Priesthood beside in council at the Millinnial Star Office<br/>
whe<strike>re</strike>n much important business was transacted and a field<br/>
of labour assigned to each officer until the next General<br/>
Conference.</p>

<p>After dinner the Twelve met by appointment<br/>
in front of the Infirmary and proceeded to a Paper storehouse<br/>
where [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley]] had made a contract for paper suficient<br/>
to print five thousand copies of the Book of Mormon. After<br/>
seeing the papers weighed and prayed for (cost £107) we walked<br/>
to Brother ^Miller^ where I took refreshments with about 20 Elders<br/>
and had a pleasant time. The Twelve then went to the Star Office<br/>
and held a council when it was voted that Parley might<br/>
go to [[New York|New York]] and get his family and that Elder [[Theodore Turley|Theodore <br/>
Turley]] should lead a company of Saints from [[England|England]] to <br/>
[[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] (or [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]) After some other business the meeting<br/>
adjourned to meet the next morning.</p>

<p>I wrote a letter to [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] next day and<br/>
on the following one for publication in the Millinnial Star<br/>
and on the day after a number of letters to my friends and<br/>
family in America to be forwared by Brother Parley to New<br/>
York and on the next I assisted brother Brigham and several<br/>
of the sisters in doing up a package of No 3 of the Millennial<br/>
Star for Parley to take to New York</p>

<p>On the 12th I attended meeting at the Joiners<br/>
Hall. Brigham preached in the morning and I in the evening<br/>
and in the afternoon we commenced with the Saints</p>

<p>Next day I received a lengthy and a<br/>
very interesting letter from my wife Phebe from which<br/>
I made some extracts to be inserted in Millinnial Star<br/>

<p>I travelled in ten of the United States and crossed<br/>
one half of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]</p>

<p>I attended seven Conferences and held thirty four<br/>

<u> to the Twelve.</u></i></p>

<p><u><i>Miscellaneous</i></u>.</p>

<p>I ordained three Elders and one Priest attended<br/>
the baptism of a number of persons but did not baptize<br/>
more than one. I [[priesthood blessing|administered]] to sixteen sick persons and<br/>
some were healed wrote 35 letters and received six and<br/>
procured ten subscribers for the [[Latter Day Saints|Messenger and Advocate]]<br/>
I also confirmed one into the Church.</p>",

of earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the Saints and for<br/>
the organization of the Church upon the ancient pattern and when I <br/>
farther contended for the gifts and graces of the Church as manifested in<br/>
the days of the Prophets and of Christ and his Apostles both priest and<br/>
people would oppose me. Therefore I could not unite with them<br/>
in Spirit nor feel at home in their meetings</p>

<p>It was during this state of things that I went before the<br/>
Lord one evening and prayed till past the midnight hour. I pled<br/>
with him to show me what to do and asked him in substance<br/>
the following questions:</p>

<p>""If the sects of the day are thy people O Lord and are<br/>
by Thee acknowledged in their worship and ordinances why am<br/>
I seperated from them in Spirit and feeling? and if they are not<br/>
Thy people why do they prosper?""</p>

<p>Of course in my prayers and suplications of that night<br/>
the questions which I have here tersely given was much lengthy<br/>
and varied than written above. But they contain the burden of<br/>
my petitions to the Lord at that time, to whom I talked in<br/>
the simplicity and straitforwardness of a child approaching his<br/>
father.</p>

<p>The Spirit answered and said unto me open the<br/>
Bible and it shall there be shown thee. This injunction I obeyed<br/>
and opened at random apparantly though I beleive it was directed<br/>
by the Spirit and read the ##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah##. There is not<br/>
a Chapter in the whole Bible which affords a more remarkable<br/>
and suitable answer to the prayers of that night. The chapter <br/>
indicated that salvation was near and the righteousness of God about to<br/>
be revealed; and [blank]</p>

<p>[eight lines blank]</p>

<p>I was satisfied with the answer to my prayer and<br/>
became convinced that the Churchs of the day were not of heavenly<br/>
origin and that they did not form the Church and Kingdom of God</p>",

<p>To be Hung on the Fourth of July for Murder</p>

<p>My wife also informed me that an Indian with<br/>
his wife and daughter had been baptized. He was the Indian Interpreter<br/>
of six tribes. Two Elders with their families had gone out on mission<br/>
to the Indians.</p>

<p>July the 15th I parted from Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
and the Saints at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and rode to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] where I again<br/>
met Elders [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]]. I brought with<br/>
me 110 Stars for brother Cordon and for brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] for<br/>
the [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] Saints 550 numbers and about 100 Hymn Books</p>

<p>Next day I visited [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] and [[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]]<br/>
where the Saints manifested much joy at seeing me again. I<br/>
was presented with a small splendid china box as a present<br/>
from the Saints in Stoke upon Trent. That night I preached<br/>
at Hanly and baptized one.</p>

<p>On the following day July 17th I wrote two<br/>
letters to [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] to be sent in a letter. I afterwards found that<br/>
my first born child</p>

from [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]] at [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa|Montrose]] and then walked to [[Leek, Staffordshire, England|Leek]] in<br/>

broke down on the road and he was thrown into the mud<br/>

and he could not utter a word but left the room as soon<br/>
as I had closed. In the even^ing^ George A Smith preached and<br/>

Liverpool appeared in sight and soon after a steam<br/>

taken at 6 o'clock and there were gathered there that evening<br/>

and found the Saints strong in the faith and increasing<br/>
fast in numbers and preparing for emigration with<br/>
the Saints to the body of the Church in America. [[John Benbow|Bro]]<br/>
and sister [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Benbow]] were willing to make every sacrifice<br/>
for the gathering of the poor among God's people. A company<br/>

<p>The churches here now numbered 800 members. I no longer continued<br/>
myself to baptize but called the local and traveling ministry under<br/>
my direction to administer the ordinance of baptism while [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>

go with him to</p>

to warn the inhabitants thereof and preach to them the<br/>
Gospel.</p>

<p>On the 5th of this month I wrote a letter to the<br/>
Millennial Star and on the next day I sealed up a package<br/>
of 42 letters and my Journal from [[Montrose, Angus, Scotland|Montrose]] to [[England|England]] to send<br/>
to my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] by Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]]. It contained all my correspondence<br/>
since the 8th of August 18<strike>2</strike>39. Enclosed also was No 1 and 3 of<br/>
the Millennial Star.</p>

<p>It was one year on the 8th since I left<br/>
Montrose and parted from my family to take a mission<br/>
to England and my history will show how the Twelve started<br/>
under afflictions and pain how fever and ague followed us<br/>
on our journey and it will show how also the Providence<br/>
of God afterwards was manifest and how wonderfully we<br/>
had been blessed in the British Mission</p>

seeds of the work in this part of the Lord's vineyard now<br/>
gathered at his own expense 40 of this 80 bound for the gathering<br/>

Elder Turley to pay the deposit money and secure the passage<br/>
of those who were to go through his benevolence. From<br/>
my soul I said ""Let the blessing of Almighty God<br/>

death of the Presiding Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Edward Patridge]] who died<br/>
May the 27th 1840 and his [[Harriet Pamela Partridge|daughter]] died a week before<br/>
him. Bishop Patridge was one of the wisest and<br/>
best men of the last days. He was like [[Nathaniel (NT)|Nathaniel]]<br/>
of old in whom there was no guile. He had passed<br/>
through much persecution with the Saints for the<br/>
word of God and the testimony of Jesus. In 1833 he<br/>
was imprisoned and tared and feathered. In 1839 he<br/>
was again imprisoned and passed through the great<br/>
persecutions of that year and he was a member and the<br/>
Bishop of the Church almost from its foundation</p>

40 miles through a level country having quite the appearance<br/>

is the largest and most famed University in the world</p>

to<br/>
The [[George Granville Sutherland-Leveson-Gower|Duke of Sutherland's]] Park.</b></p>

<p>It is about five miles in length and five<br/>

as we came on the road from Stone to Stoke was the estate<br/>
of several hundred acres of ground planted over with young<br/>
^timber^ sprouts. This land was hilly.</p>

<p>Next came spring vale. The lower fountain<br/>
is a forced vein throwing a stream of water twelve feet high<br/>
There is a fish pond above the first fountain but rather<br/>
small. On the hill above is a spendid stone house for<br/>
the purpose of keeping persons who might be insane. Around<br/>
this vale are a number of small monuments.</p>

<p>Then came into our view the Manor House<br/>
built of stone. This was mostly in ruins and was more than<br/>
five hundred years old. One family had lived in it for more<br/>
than three hundred years descending from father to son.</p>

<p>We next visited the spendid monument<br/>
errected in memory of [[George Granville Leveson-Gower|George Granville]] the late Duke and <br/>
father of the present Duke of Sutherland.</p>

of the great wonders of the age. The other collossal and<br/>
magnificent bridges of the royal Thames (England's chief river)<br/>
are London Bridge Blackfriars Waterloo Westminster and<br/>

into the lower court of the House of the Lord with Elders [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B.<br/>
Nobles]] and G. W. Meeks to spend the night in prayer and fasting<br/>
before God. Part of the night we had a severe trial of our faith<br/>
by temptation from Satan but before day we obtained a good degree<br/>
of victory over him and the Lord poured out his [[spirit of the Lord|spirit]] upon us<br/>
and we felt it good to be in the House of our God when nature<br/>
was hushed in silence and the shades of night covered the earth<br/>
In the morning we returned to our homes intending to spend the</p>",

on the face of the earth that would present to our view so grand<br/>
a scenery as the one before us</p>

<p><strike>This Monument on which we stood is 24<br/>
feet higher than Trajans Pillar at Rome and on it is the following <br/>
inscription in Latin:</strike></p>

from hence at the distance of 202 feet, the hight up this column<br/>
about midnight a most terrible fire broke out which driven<br/>
on by a high wind not only wasted the adjacent parts but<br/>
also places very remote with incredible noise and fury.<br/>
It consumed 89 churches the gates of the City, Guild Hall<br/>
many public structures hospitals schools libraries and a vast<br/>
number of stately edifices 13,200 dwelling houses 400 streets<br/>
of 26 Wards it utterly destroyed 15 and left 8 others shattered<br/>
and half burnt. The ruins of the City were 436 acres:<br/>
from the Tower by the Thames side to the Temple Church<br/>
and from the North East Gate along the City wall to Holborn<br/>
Bridge. To the estates and fortunes of the citizens it <br/>
was merciless but to their lives very favourable (only eight<br/>
being lost) That it might in all things resemble the<br/>
last conflagration of the world the destruction was sudden<br/>
for in a small space of time the same city was set [ink smear]<br/>
most flourishing and reduced to nothing. Th<strike>e</strike>^ree^ days after, <br/>
When the fatal fire had baffled all human councils and<br/>
endeavours, the opinion of all, as it were by the will of<br/>
heaven it stoped and on every side was extinguished.</strike></p>

<p><strike>August 22nd I received a letter from<br/>
Mrs Woodruff which gave me much joy and I wrote her<br/>
in return. We also received one from Brigham Young<br/>
and a copy of the 4th No of the Millennial Star. I walked<br/>
out in the evening near the house of Parliament and bought<br/>
a good pocket watch and paid £2.90</strike></p>

<p><strike>Next day</strike> ^August 23rd^ we went to Zion's chapel and<br/>
heard the celebrated Rev [[Robert Aitken|Robert Aitken]] preach two sermons<br/>
He delivered <strike>an interesting</strike> ^a powerful^ warning to the Gentiles, and presented<br/>
some of the most sublime truths I ever heard from a sectarian<br/>
priest; but he was building without the foundation.</p>",

one of whom was a preacher. I then walked to [[Shucknall Hill, Herefordshire, England|Shuknell Hill]] a<br/>
noted and sightly place. The plains looked beautiful and the<br/>
valleys around the <strike>place</strike> ^town^ made the scenery picteresque in<br/>
appearence. Notwithstanding that this was but a country<br/>
place I counted twenty one churches from the top of the hill</p>",
42828.0,96,,""">April the 6th</time> was the great day of the Solemn Assembly<br/>
As upon this day the Church was organized in 1830 the six of April<br/>
has become a day specially set apart and as this an[niversary]<br/>
of the organization of the Church was like the Pentecost at<br/>
[[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] [##Acts 2##] I shall somewhat fully record the proceedings of this time</p>

<p>At 8 o'clock a.m. I went up to the [[House of the Lord|House of the<br/>
Lord]] and spent an hour in the lower part. The Presidents<br/>
of the Church then called the quorums of the Seventies in the<br/>
upper part of the house as there was some business to be attended<br/>
to before they could proceed with the order of the day</p>

<p>In the first place six of the Presidents of the<br/>
Seventies were taken from that position and transferred<br/>
to the quorum of the [[traveling high council|travelling High Priests]] and six other<br/>
Presidents were chosen in their stead. I shall not give the<br/>
particulars of this change: suffice it to say that all of the<br/>
counsellors first chosen excepting [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] were High Priests<br/>
before the organization of the Seventies and they had the right<br/>
to officiate in the lower offices of the Church</p>

<p>The six new Presidents chosen out of the Seventies to<br/>
take the places of those who were to be transferred were [blank]</p>

<p>After this matter was arranged there was a glorious<br/>
ordinance performed upon the heads of those of the Elders who<br/>
had been anointed. While all the anointed present standing<br/>
lifted their hands towards heaven the First Presidency of<br/>
the Church confirmed and sealed upon our heads all the blessings<br/>
of our ordination anointing and [[patriarchal blessing|Patriarchal]] with a seal in the<br/>
presence of God and the Lamb and his holy angels. This seal was<br/>
confirmed with a [[Hosanna Shout|shout]] from all the anointed with uplifted hands of</p>

<p>Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna to God and the Lamb!<br/>
Amen, Amen, and Amen!</p>

<p>This was repeated three times and if ever a shout entered<br/>
the portals of heaven this did and was echoed by the</p>",

Merryfields]], No 15 Glousester Row, Grange Road, where we obtained<br/>
room for all three of us.</p>

<p><strike>We visited St. Paul's Cathedral and went all<br/>
through the lower court. Excepting St Peter's at Rome this is the<br/>
largest and most famed in the world.</strike></p>

<p><strike>St Paul's is 500 feet long 285 feet wide<br/>
from North to South 404 high from East to West and<br/>
it contains 74 monuments of fine marble erected over the<br/>
toombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals and Earls and men<br/>
of other titles who have distinguished themselves in the military<br/>
service of Great Britian and otherwise. Lord Nelson's <br/>
Monument is the largest and most noted of the whole of<br/>
the men thus honoured. Their bodies are placed in the <br/>
vaults and their monuments erected on the flour above</strike></p>

<p><strike>This cathedral has three lofty spires and the<br/>
whole building is magnificient.</strike></p>

<p><strike>St. Paul's church was first built by St Augustine<br/>
in the year 610 and was destroyed by fire in 961 and<br/>
rebuilt the following year. It was not until the reign of<br/>
Athelstan that London became the Metropolis of England<br/>
and it was to this King that St Paul's was mostly indebted<br/>
for its permanent establishment and pre-eminence. In 1086<br/>
it was again destroyed by fire which also laid the greater part<br/>
of the Metropolis in ruins. Maurice Bishop of London who<br/>
had been chaplain and Chancellor to William the Conqurer conceived<br/>
the vast design of erecting the magnificient structure which<br/>
immediately preceeded the present cathedral. In 1099 it was<br/>
sufficiently built to admit of public worship but was again partly<br/>
burned in 1132 and again in 1135-6 and sustained considerable<br/>
injury. The central tower was completed in 1221 and additions<br/>
was made to the building from time to time. The lofty spire<br/>
of the Cathedral was fired by lighting in 1444 and not repaired<br/>
till 1462 and in 1561 it again caught on fire and the roof<br/>
^was^ also destroyed. Queen Elizabeth commenced to repair it and<br/>
Charles the First completed it at the cost of ^£^104330.^S^4.^d^8; but<br/>
under the rule of the Parliament and Cromwell the cathedral<br/>
suffered beyond any former example. Its revenues were</strike></p>",

that he is in very deed and a Prophet of God raised up for the<br/>
deliverence of Israel</p>

<p>He desired us to give heed to his words and<br/>
teachings and be wise that Zion and her stakes might be<br/>
redeemed. He also presented us in some degree with the plot<br/>
of the city of [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] which is the strong hold of the daughter of<br/>
Zion. The plan which he presented was given to him by<br/>
vision and the future will prove that the visions of Joseph concerning<br/>
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] all the various Stakes of Zion and of the redemption<br/>
of Israel will be fulfilled in the time appointed of the Lord.</p>

<p>Presidents [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]] and [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney <br/>
Rigdon]] followed with suitable addresses to the congregation.</p>

<p>The Twelve were then called upon to break bread<br/>
for the multitude as Jesus did in the days of <strike>t</strike>his Apostles when the<br/>
multitude followed him. [##Matthew 14:19-20##] This was done and the congregation was<br/>
satisfied and we were made glad while feasting with Patriarchs Prophets<br/>
Apostles Evangelists Pastors and Teachers. [##Ephesians 4:11##]</p>

lifted hands to heaven. And this being at about the setting of the</p>",

converted into stables and barracks. In the reign of Charles the Second<br/>
it was again repared but was not finished when it became a prey<br/>
to the great fire of London in 1666. The new cathedral—the St<br/>
Paul's of to day was built by Sir Christopher Wren. The first<br/>
stone was laid on the 21st of June 1675 and the cap stone laid<br/>
by the son of the Architect in 1710 and it was finished and<br/>
issued by George the First in 17<strike>50</strike> ^1715^. Its cost was over one million<br/>
and half sterling English money or nearly six million dollars<br/>
Its length from East to West is 500 ^ft^ and the breadth of the<br/>
body of the Church 285 ft. and to the top of the cross over the dome<br/>
its height is 404 ft: and it covers over two acres of ground.</strike></p>

<p><strike>I again visited this cathedral on the 7th of<br/>
September and went from the lower floor to the ball and <br/>
visited every part of the building for public inspection. I walked<br/>
through the Whispering Gallery where a person can hear a<br/>
whisper from any part of it and when the door shuts<br/>
it penetrates the ear like peels of thunder.</strike></p>

<p>On the 25 of August we attended a meeting<br/>
of the Temperance Society, at their Hall which we engaged,<br/>
but could not have it until the 7th of the next month. Br [[George Albert Smith|Smith]]<br/>
a short speech. On the following day, we started out to try to<br/>
get some doors opened for preaching. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
went to one part of the city and brother Smith and myself<br/>
to another. We called upon two Baptist Ministers and<br/>
asked one for his chapel. In the evening we attended a <br/>
Methodist meeting in Song Lane.</p>

<p>Next day we again went to the Temperance<br/>
Hall, in St George's Road, near the Elephant &amp; Castle, and by the<br/>
request of the <strike>meeting </strike> ^comittee^ I addressed the meeting upon the subject<br/>
of temperance, followed by George A Smith. We gave out<br/>
an appointment to preach the Gospel at that place Sep the 7th</p>

<p>The day after we all started out to go<br/>
through the city of London to see if we could find a<br/>
man with the Spirit of God; and after wandering through<br/>
the city, not knowing whither we went, we came upon a<br/>
man and stoped him and spoke to him. Brother<br/>
Kimball asked him if he was a preacher? He said</p>",
42828.0,190,,""">15th<br/>
of April</time> and wished me to attend.</p>",
42828.0,98,,""">day</time> I spent in writing my Journal<br/>
until evening when I went up to the House of the Lord <strike>in</strike>with<br/>
Elders [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Nobles]]. We were afterwards<br/>
joined by an aged father in Israel by name [[Freeman Nickerson|Freeman Nickerson]]<br/>
who was very faithful and a man of much prayer. Before<br/>
he joined us the power of Satan strove much against us; but<br/>
our faith and peseverance in the Lord overcame him and we<br/>
were as baptized with the Holy Ghost</p>

<p>When we first entered the House of the Lord<br/>
we entered one of the Stands within the veils and fell upon our<br/>
knees but the Evil One strove against us with so much power<br/>
and temptation that at one time I was driven from my<br/>
stand. But notwithstanding his apparant victory good grew<br/>
out of it for by going into the courtyard I found father Nickerson<br/>
whom I solicited to join us that we might gain a victory over<br/>
Satan. He joyfully accepted the invitation and we were now<br/>
four in number and of one accord. Moreover we had great<br/>
cause to be united in heart for we had travelled together about<br/>
one thousand miles in the Spring of 1834 for the redemption of<br/>
Zion. At that time we offered to lay down our lifes and <br/>
our offerings were accepted as was [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham's]] [##Genesis 22##] and now we could<br/>
unitedly prevail and obtain a blessing through Jesus Christ.<br/>
We fell upon our knees and cried mightily unto the Lord and<br/>
the Evil one departed and the Spirit of God within us was like<br/>
fire shut up in our bones and many great things was shown unto<br/>
us by the Holy Ghost and minifested in prophecy and revelation</p>",
42828.0,238,,"<p>he was. He seemed to have a good spirit, and informed us<br/>
that he had been to america, and had come to London for<br/>
the purpose of going to [[South Australia, Australia|South Australia]], but had just burried<br/>
one child and another laid at the point of death. Brother<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] told him his child should live. He gave us some<br/>
information where we could preach. On the same day we<br/>
called upon him and found his child better, but he was<br/>
not at home. We then went and heard a Calvinest preach<br/>
and he gave us an invitation to call and see him</p>

<p>Next day we again went over the city to see<br/>
if we could ^find^ any of the children of God. We found one man<br/>
and his household who received our testimony, and he opened<br/>
his doors for us to preach. We appointed a meeting at his house<br/>
for Sunday evening. His name was [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]], and he lived at<br/>
52 Ironmonger Row, [[St. Luke|St. Luke's]] Parish, near the Church.</p>

The City of London.</strike></p>

<p>We had spent twelve days in going to and fro<br/>
^through^ [[London, Middlesex, England|London]], trying to find a people willing to receive our testimony,<br/>
but finding the doors shut against us, we determined in<br/>
the name of God to ^go^ into the streets and lift up our voices</p>

<p>Accordingly Elders Kimball, [[George Albert Smith|Smith]], and myself<br/>
started out on Sunday morning, August the 30th; walked<br/>
three miles and stoped in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]], Old Street, where<br/>
we found an Aitkenite preaching to the people, who was<br/>
followed by a Presbyterian. Just as the latter was about to<br/>
begin, Elder Kimball informed him that there was a preacher<br/>
from America present who would like to speak when he<br/>
got through. The preacher then informed the people that<br/>
there was an American minister present, and proposed that<br/>
he should speak first. Elder George A Smith then got into<br/>
the chair, and spoke about 20 minutes, and then the Presbyterian<br/>
spoke. George A. had informed the people that there were<br/>
two other American Preachers present who would like to<br/>
address them; and, when the Presbyterian <strike>had</strike> closed, Elder</p>",
42828.0,191,,""">14th of April eighteen hundred<br/>

there at 3 o'clock. He answered ""No;<strike>""</strike> not at all. What<br/>
denomination do you belong to?"" ""To the church of Jesus<br/>
Christ of Latter Day Saints"" was the reply</p>

<p>""Oh I have heard of them"" he said. They are<br/>
""a bad people; they have done much hurt; they divide churches;<br/>
""we don't want to hear you.""</p>

<p>He then mounted the chair again and said <br/>
to the people, ""I have just heard that the last man who spoke<br/>
belongs to the Latter-Day Saints;"" and <strike>then</strike> he began to rail<br/>
against us.</p>

<p>Elder Kimball asked him to let him step<br/>
into the chair to give out an appointment for a 3 o'clock<br/>
meeting, but he would not let him. Brother Kimball then<br/>
raised his voice and informed the people that some American<br/>
preachers would preach there at 3 o'clock. <strike>and</strike></p>

<p><strike>a</strike>At the appointed<br/>
time we were at the place. The conduct of the preacher and<br/>
the excitement upon the subject brought together a large <br/>
congregation to hear us. I opened the meeting by singing and<br/>
prayer and spoke about 20 minutes, from Gal I. 8, 9 v, and<br/>
was followed by Elder Kimball for about the same length of<br/>
time. The people gave good attention and seemed to be<br/>
much interested in what they heard</p>

<p>After meeting Mr [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]] invited us home;<br/>
but, soon after we arrived at his house, Elder Kimball<br/>
felt impressed to return to the place of preaching. When he got there he found a large company<br/>
talking about the things which they had heard, and they wished<br/>
him to speak to them again. He did so and addressed<br/>
them at considerable length, and afterwards several invited<br/>
him home to their houses.</p>

<p>While he was away a man who had been<br/>
a preacher came to Mr Corner's; <strike>and</strike> I gave him a brief<br/>

down into the earth we entered the archway on the left 1120 ft.<br/>
of which was finished. It was beautifully lighted up with gas. We<br/>
walked through the Tunnel with the River Thames and the shipping<br/>
over our heads and in some places there is not more than<br/>
fifteen feet between the top of the arch and the bed of the river<br/>
There are two archways running the whole length of the tunnel<br/>
with openings affording free communication from one archway<br/>
to the other: At the time we visited the Tunnel it was<br/>
considered of the kind one of the most gigantic and wonderful<br/>
of human achievements. Visitors to this place of note in after<br/>
years are familiar with a grand Bazar not there at the time<br/>
we visited it and [[Thames Tunnel, London, Middlesex, England|Thames Tunnel]] purchases of Jewelry toys and<br/>
fancy things are carried away by the visitors to all parts of<br/>
the world as curiosities of association with one of the wonderful<br/>
places of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and momentoes of their purchasers visits to the<br/>
great Tunnel under the monarch of [[England|England's]] rivers.</strike></p>

<p><strike>About under <strike>In</strike> the centre of the River Thames we wrote<br/>
in a record our names professions and residences and when<br/>
we came out we went to the [[Tower of London, London, Middlesex, England|Tower of London]] in a boat, the<br/>
distance being about 2 miles. We did not spend much<br/>
time here for it was getting late and we could not<br/>
therefore go through all the different appartments</strike></p>

<p><strike>Next day</strike> ^On the 2nd of Sept^ I was quite ill. I had been<br/>
unwell for several days but now I was obliged to keep to<br/>
my room; but Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] went into the<br/>
City to visit the people and found some who hearkened<br/>
to them favourably. We had by this time found that<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] was the hardest place for a mission ^that^ <strike>which</strike> we had<br/>
ever undertaken, but we did not feel discouraged in the<br/>
least; and were determined in the name of the Lord to set<br/>
up the standard of the Kingdom in that city</p>

<p>The following day I was still confined to<br/>
my room most of the time but on the next Elders Kimball<br/>
and Smith went to [[Deptford, London, Middlesex, England|Debtford]], and I took a walk into the<br/>
city called upon Brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]] and found him in good <br/>
spirits. I also called upon [[Mr. Panther|Mr Panther]], 17 Warf, City Road,<br/>

^seconded^ that Parley P. Pratt be chosen as the Editor of the monthly periodical<br/>
for the Church. Elder Kimball moved and P. P. Pratt seconded<br/>
that a committee of three be appointed to make a selection of<br/>

<p>Elder Willard Richards proposed that<br/>

which would ^hold^ 500 and that I might have that on Sunday. So<br/>
I gave out an appointment at Bowl Court 137 Thornditch. I<br/>
conversed with several others who received my testimony<br/>
and one woman said she would be baptized</p>

<p><strike>I returned home by the way of [[Smithfield, City of London, England|Smithfield's]]<br/>
market which covers about 20 acres of ground. It was<br/>
Fair time and I never saw such a sight before. There<br/>
were 20 acres of ground covered with cattle sheep and<br/>
caravans of beast of every name and large bands of music<br/>
belonging to these ""Shows"" were playing to call the people<br/>
to the exhibitions of the numerous manageries which had<br/>
gathered from all parts of the country to the Smith field<br/>
Market Fair. There was also a conglomeration of everything<br/>
there. I thought, ""Could a Missourian from the western<br/>
wiles of America whose Knowledge estended only to his<br/>
gun, corn, crib and hog-pen behold such a shight he<br/>
would think himself in another world and perhaps retire<br/>
heart-sickened with the sense as I did; and no man who<br/>
loved virtue peace and retirement could feel otherwise in<br/>
viewing a scene like the Smith field Market Fair. Yet<br/>
Fairs are yearly he<strike>n</strike>ld in every part of the nation and in<br/>
fact they form one of the venerable institutions of the<br/>
land. They are some of the ""good old English relics"" and<br/>
are strikingly pictorial of ""Merry England"" of olden times<br/>
^English^ Fairs are more plebian and belong more exclusively to the<br/>
peasantry and lower classes them English ""Races."" The latter<br/>
through just as much a national institution of the peasantry<br/>
and masses of England as the former also is a national institution<br/>
with the higher classes. The English Race course is not only<br/>
crowded with the tens of thousands of plebian <strike>stock</strike> ^fully folk^ but <strike>thee</strike> <br/>
crowds of mobility fashionable society and sportsman from<br/>
all the country around will be there gathered on race days<br/>
But English Fairs and English Races ^take^ from a moral point of<br/>
view are about on a level and there are none of the old<br/>
national institutions of that country so illustrative of the<br/>
type of ""Merry England"" in olden times. They are in<br/>

been convened three days. I felt happy to have the privilege<br/>
of sitting with my brethren of the Twelve to consult upon<br/>
the establishing of the [[work of God|work of God]] among the nations and<br/>
kingdoms of the earth and it was with much satisfaction that<br/>

holliday pictures magnified of ""Merry England"" in every day life<br/>
Smithfield Market Fair as viewed by me that day was one of these<br/>
pictorials of the merry days of yore. It is years this scene was<br/>
repulsion to me but it was none the less illustrative of the<br/>
national characteristics of the past. In later years this fair<br/>
which was known by the name of Bartholemew Fair was<br/>

<p>Visit to [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]]</p>

<p>September the 5th Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] and<br/>
myself visited the Westminster Abbey. Here going through<br/>
every appartment we saw all the [[tomb|toomes]] and monuments<br/>
of the Kings Queens Princes Lords and noted men who have<br/>
ever been entombed within its walls.</p>

<p>One part of the Abbey was built in the<br/>
year 600 and has now stood over 1200 years. Most of<br/>
the kings and queens of England are entoombed in<br/>
Westminister Abbey who have died during those twelve<br/>
centuries.</p>

<p>Here we saw what are esteemed perfect<br/>
likeness of Queen's [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and [[Anne of Great Britain|Ann]], Lord<br/>
[[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and others. We saw the full coronation<br/>
dress of Queen Ann and also the chair in which [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Queen<br/>
Victoria]] and all the kings and queens for the last eight<br/>
hundred years were crowned. This chair of State is<br/>
covered with gold tissue and it contains a stone under<br/>
the seat in which all the Scottish chiefs and [[Scotland|Scotland's]]<br/>
Kings were crowned since they were a people. Fabulous<br/>
tradition declare this stone to be the identical stone that<br/>
was [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob's]] pillar</p>

<p>I baptized Mr [[Thomas Kington|Thomas Kington]]<br/>

afternoon on which Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] preached and<br/>
I bore my testimony to their words. One man arose<br/>
and opposed us, and was angry because of the truth of<br/>
God. He continued opposing, until the police stoped<br/>
the conversation.</p>

<p>We met again in the evening at Bowl<br/>
Court, to preach to the people, but when we got there we<br/>
found a plan contrived by several of the preachers for<br/>
one of them to preach, lest some should beleive our<br/>
testimony. <strike>When we found this</strike>, We went our way and<br/>
found four persons who received our testimony and<br/>
offered themselves for baptism</p>

<p>Next day I wrote to Elder [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] of<br/>
my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] field of labour and walked to Bro<br/>
[[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] and visited several other friends. Two offered<br/>
themselves for baptism. I visited [[The Church of St. Paul, Liverpool, Lancashire, England|St Paul's]] and then<br/>
returned home. Elders Kimball and Smith had<br/>
just returned from</p>

<p>A Visit to the Rev. [[Robert Aitken|Robert Aitken]]</p>

<p>He received them kindly, acknowledged their<br/>
doctrine true, but was affraid of deception. His mind<br/>
was in a disturbed state.</p>

<p>In the evening we held a meeting in<br/>
the Temperance Hall; but we had almost the bare<br/>
walls to preach to, there being only about thirty present<br/>
I preached to the few present for about an hour, and<br/>
Elder Kimball followed me. After paying 7/6/ seven shillings<br/>
and six pence for the use of the hall we returned to our<br/>
lodgings.</p>

<p><strike>Part of the next day we spent in<br/>
visiting places and things connected with the crown. We<br/>
started out together and walked to King St. and Union<br/>
St. and passed by [[Surrey Chapel, Southwark, Middlesex, England|Surry Chapel]] which was built and<br/>
occupied for many years by the celebrated [[Rowland Hill|Rowland Hill]]<br/>
whose body lies under this chapel</strike></p>

<p><strike>From thence we continued to [[Westminster Bridge, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster<br/>
Bridge]] which brought us direct to [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]]</strike></p>",
42828.0,197,,""">17th</time> being [[Good Friday|Good Friday]] the Twelve<br/>
met at [[Penwortham, Lancashire, England|Penworthham]] two miles from Preston to visit the<br/>
Saints and spend the day together before they seperated for<br/>
their several fields of labour. Sister Moon opened a bottle<br/>
of wine for us to bless and partake of. This bottle of wine<br/>
she had kept for forty years. After spending the day<br/>
in conversing about the things of the [[kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] we<br/>
returned to Preston.</p>

<p>The time had come for the Twelve to seperate<br/>
and go into different parts of the [[vineyard of the Lord|Lord's vinyard]]. It was<br/>
thought widsom for Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimble]] to visist the Churches<br/>
which he had built up while in [[England|England]] on his former</p>",
42828.0,245,,"<p>and the House of Parliament. We walked through</p>

<p>the House of Lords and Commons</p>

<p>of [[England|England]] and sat  in the chair in which the speakers of the house<br/>
of Lords had sat for many years. In this room all the<br/>
speeches were made by that great orator [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] concerning<br/>
America before the [[American Revolution|revolution]]. As the House of Commons<br/>
was burned down about six years before our visit this room<br/>
was then occupied by the Commons and there was another<br/>
house built for the Lords at that time</p>

<p>One would naturally suppose that a<br/>
room fitted up to contain the Lords and Commons of<br/>
England would be extraordinary grand and expensive but<br/>
it is quite the reverse being exceedingly plain and undecorated</p>

<p>On entering the room one would sooner<br/>
think he was in an American School House than in<br/>
the House of the Lords of England</p>

<p>Next we visited St James Park and<br/>
saw a company of two hundred foot soldiers the Grenadier<br/>
Gards on parade accompanied by a fine martial band<br/>
Afterwards we saw the Queen's Horse Guards on parade<br/>
one hundred in number with their bodies covered<br/>
with steel which shone right martially. They wore<br/>
helmets and breastplates of steel which glistening in the<br/>
sun's rays made them appear as though they were encased<br/>
in polished armour; and they were mounted on powerful<br/>
black mares whose glosy coats and high mettle well<br/>
became the pride and pomp of war. It would be hard<br/>
to convince an Englishman that the Queen's Horse Guards<br/>
was not the finest regiment in the world. The charge<br/>
of the Guards at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] is immortalized by the Wellingtonian<br/>
household tradition of ""Up Guards and at them"" which won<br/>
that famous battle upon which the destiny of [[Europe|Europe]] hung<br/>
and gave to the Iron Duke the crown of glory as Conquerer<br/>
of [[Napoleon Bonaparte of France|Napoleon]] the Great. We may be told by those<br/>
who are sceptical to popular traditions that the great<br/>
[[Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington|Duke]] never uttered this famous command and we may <br/>
read that Iron Duke himself was doubtful of the tradition still<br/>
the masses will beleive it and the ""Up Guards and at them!""</p>",

the Twelve who were to branch out in other directions<br/>
and with Brigham Young started on my return to my<br/>
fields of labour. We took train a^nd^ journied to Manchester<br/>
and then continued by coach to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] where we spent<br/>
the night at brother Johnstons</p>

<p>Next day being Sunday Elder [[Brigham Young|B.<br/>
Young]] preached to the people of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] in the morning<br/>
and evening and in the afternoon we communed with<br/>
the Saints and spent an interesting time. We spent<br/>
the night at [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] with Brother [[William Hulme|Hulme]].</p>

<p>The following day we took coach at<br/>
Stoke and rode to [[Stafford, Staffordshire, England|Stafford]] and thence to [[Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England|Wolverhampton]]<br/>
where we stayed for the night and on the morrow we<br/>
proceeded by coach to [[Dudley, Staffordshire, England|Dudly]] and had a good view of the<br/>
old Dudly castle and from thence to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] in which<br/>
city we spent several hours.</p>

<p>Here we visited the ancient and noted<br/>

archetecture anything which I had ever viewed. Its length<br/>
is about 400 feet and this magnificient structure is between<br/>

tradition with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelsons]] ""[[England|England]] expects every man this day<br/>

most certainly a magnificient regiment any how. They are<br/>
to the English Army what [[Napoleon Bonaparte of France|Napoleons]] ""Old Guard"" was to the<br/>
^French^ but while the ""Old Guard"" of the Emperor was broken forever<br/>
at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], the Horse Guards of the grand Willingtonian<br/>
charge lived to do splendid service and maintain their<br/>
prestige in after years in the Crimean war fighting side<br/>
by side with the French whose Imperial head was<br/>
still a [[Napoléon III of France|Napoleon]] as before This time they were alies<br/>
and not foes yet then the French won from the English<br/>
some of the Glory lost at Waterloo in spite of the fact<br/>
that the Queens Guards and the crack regiments of England<br/>
never behaved better, for instance that madly brilliant<br/>
Balaclavia charge at the Light Horse of the English army<br/>
In viewing and visitng th famous things and places of<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] I always felt interested in their historical associations<br/>
and reminenscences</strike></p>

<p><strike>Passing from the martial view of the<br/>
Queens Horse Guards we visited the monument errected<br/>
in honour of the Duke of York which was 135 feet in<br/>
height. Here I parted from Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] and<br/>
walked the whole length of [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St James' Park]]. It has a<br/>
fine pond in the centre and mansions and palaces<br/>
around.</strike></p>

<p><strike>I first visited the palace of the<br/>
Queen Dowager [[Adelaide of the United Kingdom|widow]] of [[William IV of England|William]] the Fourth next the<br/>
mansion of the Duke of <strike>Sumerset</strike> ^Somerset^ which was quite<br/>
splendid and then [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]]. This palace<br/>
was occupied by Her Majesty Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Victoria]] and His Highness<br/>
Prince [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, b. 1819|Albert]]. It covers a number of acres of ground<br/>
and every door enterance and gate was strongly guarded by<br/>
armed soldiers</strike></p>

<p><strike>I walked nearly around this palace and<br/>
while doing so I had the privilege of seeing</strike></p>

[[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] and that evening we were to hold at his house the<br/>
weekly prayer meeting of the Branch.</p>

<p>As we began to gather together the beating<br/>
of drums and kettles were heard through the street and the<br/>
mob soon collected and paraded in front of the house<br/>
We closed the window and shutters and doors in the house and<br/>
I opened the meeting with singing and prayer</p>

<p>But we had no sooner commenced than<br/>
the mob armed themselves with rocks bricks eggs and any<br/>
thing they could lay their hands upon and began to throw<br/>
them at the house like a shower of hailstones for nearly<br/>
an hour. They dashed in the windows scattered bricks and<br/>
glass through the rooms broke the tiles of the roof and<br/>
continued such depredations until the close of the meeting<br/>
The brethren being disposed to test the virtue of the laws<br/>
which were strict against such outrages I proposed to<br/>
go into the midst of the mob to see who they were but<br/>
they would not permit me lest I should receive injury<br/>
from the shower of stones. Several of the brethren<br/>
however went themselves and took down the names of<br/>
the leaders and returned to the house in the midst of a<br/>
volley of stones and brik-bats but without injury. Soon <br/>
afterwards the mob broke up and having cleared the room<br/>
of the bricks stones and glass we laid down to rest<br/>
and had a good night</p>

<p>I was at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] on the 18th<br/>
and found the Saints in good spirits and learned that<br/>
Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] had sailed from [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] on the 8th with a<br/>
company of 200 saints. [[John Benbow|Brother]] and Sister [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Benbow]]<br/>
and the rest of the emigrant company were rejoicing in the<br/>

viewed its choice and extensive collection of the best paintings of<br/>

contain for one day. Three miles walk farther through<br/>
the city brought me to Brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] where I again joined<br/>

<p>We had spent twenty three days in<br/>
that great Babylon of modern times and had found it harder<br/>
to establish the Church there, than in any place where<br/>
we had ever been. We had baptized one man, and ordained<br/>
him a priest; and six others had given in their names to<br/>
be baptized on the following Sunday; and at this time<br/>
there was some little prospect of the Reverend [[Robert Aitken|Robert Aitken]]<br/>

the work was universally and rapidly progressing in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]<br/>
In some cases it was even reaching the nobility, and a lady<br/>
of title had become convinced of the work of God <strike>in</strike> ^through^ our<br/>
ministry.</p>

<p>On the 12th, two days after my<br/>
return I wrote from [[Leigh, Lancashire, England|Leigh]] a historical letter to Elder<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] including my travels with him in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]<br/>
This was the first letter I had ever written to him</p>

<p>The next day Sunday I met the<br/>
Saints at Leigh and communed with them and at<br/>
a neighbouring place preached in the afternoon at<br/>
2 o'clock to a large congregation. In the evening I again<br/>
preached at Leigh and 4 were baptized by Elder [[Henry Glover|Glover]]<br/>

<p>Elder Kington was appointed to represent this Conference<br/>
at the General Conference of the British Mission to the <br/>
held at Manchester Oct. 6, 1840.</p>

<p>The minutes were then read and accepted<br/>
and afterwards exhortations given by the Elders and then<br/>
the Conference adjourned till Dec. 14th 1840. Benediction from W. Woodruff.</p>",
42828.0,254,,"<p>These two Conferences, with their forty branch<br/>
churches, and over a thousand organized members, under<br/>
the direction of one hundred and thirteen ordained officers,<br/>
had been raised up <strike>in</strike>within six months and a half. Surely<br/>
the work of God had been marvellous, unparalleled<br/>
perhaps in the history of any new religious movement,<br/>
unparalleled in the foundation of Christian Churches of<br/>
every denomination either in ancient or modern times<br/>
To God the Giver of the power and efficacy of our<br/>
administration of the Gospel in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] and regions<br/>
around be the glory and not unto the humble ministers<br/>
of that work</p>

<p>I meditated upon these things and<br/>
in my journal of date Sept 21st 1840 I wrote thus:</p>

<p>""This has been a busy day with me. After<br/>
standing upon my feet from morning till evening I am<br/>
called to shake hands with hundreds of Saints with glad<br/>
hearts and cheerful countenances. It is with no ordinary<br/>
feelings that I meditate upon the cheering fact that<br/>
a thousand souls have been baptized into the New<br/>
and Everlasting Covenant in about half a year in one field<br/>
which God has enabled me to open. I pray Him to accept<br/>
the gratitude of my heart for his mercies and blessings<br/>
unto me in this thing and enable me to stand with<br/>
these Saints and all the righteous in His Celestial Kingdom""</p>

<p>This day I had stood upon my feet<br/>
eight hours in conference conversed much of the time in suggesting<br/>
speeking motioning &amp;c; ordained about 30 confirmed some healed<br/>
many who were sick shook hands with about 400 Saints<br/>
walked 2 miles and ended with 4 hours of chimney corner<br/>
preaching. I then laid down to rest and dreamt of<br/>
catching fish.</p>

<p>Next day I was called upon to visit<br/>
a young man who lay dangerously ill and in danger<br/>
of the lockjaw from a cut of the ancle and bruise<br/>
of the knee. I rebuked the inflamation and pain of<br/>
the body and he was made whole. I baptized<br/>
[[Edward Jones|Edward Jones]] a Game keeper and confirmed two</p>",
42828.0,250,,"<p>Next day I walked from [[Turkey Hall, Eldersfield, Worcestershire, England|Turkey Hall]] to [[Redmarley D|Forty Green]]<br/>
and wrote a letter to [[Lady Roberts|Lady Roberts]] a companion of the<br/>
lady of [[Squire Dowdswell|Squire Dowdswell]] and sent it by the hand<br/>
of sister Brooks.</p>

<p>Lady Roberts was of the nobility of<br/>
[[England|England]] and a lady of wealth, and had withdrawn<br/>
from the Church of England and the travelled much<br/>
in search of truth looking for the fulfilment of the<br/>
Prophets.</p>

<p>She became acquainted with the fulness<br/>
of the Gospel through a female servant in the employ<br/>
of Squire Dowdswell. She began to investigate<br/>
the subject; <strike>and</strike> the Spirit of God rested upon her<br/>
and convinced her of the truth of the work. <strike>and</strike> <strike>s</strike>She<br/>
obtained the 4 numbers published of the Millennial<br/>
Star and fearing that she should not be able to<br/>
obtain them for herself, copied the whole of them<br/>
with her pen. She also read the Book of Mormon<br/>
and copied a part of that, and became perfectly<br/>
convinced of the truth of the work of which she<br/>
read, and said she would go a thousand miles<br/>
but what she would see some of the Twelve and<br/>
be baptized under their hands. <strike>and</strike> <strike>h</strike>Hearing that<br/>
I was in London she was about to take a journey<br/>
there to see me, and the other brethren, and be baptized<br/>
She had two brothers ministers of the Church of<br/>
England.</p>

<p><strike>Having returned from London, I, therefore, <br/>
addressed her by letter upon the work of God, into which<br/>
at that time she was so earnestly entering, to which<br/>
she returned me a verbal answer by Sister Brooks, thanking<br/>
me kindly for the interest which I manifested in her welfare,<br/>
and saying that she should address me by letter in a few days</strike></p>

<p><strike>Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] in [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] had faithfully<br/>
warned the people and had succeeded in raising up a<br/>
Church of fifty saints. This had stired up the<br/>
inhabitants of that place to much anger against us<br/>
and especially the Rev. [[John Simons|John Simons]] Rector of the Church</strike></p>",
42828.0,255,,"<p>The day following I was called upon to visit another<br/>
young man who lay dangerously ill with the fever. He<br/>
covenanted to keep the commandments of God and I<br/>
anointed him and rebuked the fever and he began<br/>
to recover. I also visited an aged Saint upon her<br/>
death bed and blessed her. She was rejoicing in<br/>
the fulness of the Gospel in death</p>

<p>The Church ministers at this time were very<br/>
much stirred up in this region because of the success of the<br/>
work of God in the midst of the people and every exertion<br/>
were made by them to stay its progress. They were finding<br/>
that the Lord was delivering their flocks out of their hands<br/>
and giving them unto the Shepherds of the Church of the<br/>
Saints. They were alarmed and were holding conventions<br/>
and meetings to continue plans and adopt means to over-<br/>
throw the Latter-day Work of God which they understood<br/>
not and beleived not yet feared its power. And well<br/>
indeed they might for in some instances they did not<br/>
have more than 10 or 15 at their churches on the Sabbath<br/>
while around them on every hand they had seen forty<br/>
Branches of two organized Conferences of the Church of<br/>
Latter-Day Saints spring up in about six months with<br/>
over a thousand members and between one and two<br/>
hundred officers ordained to scatter the ^seed of the^ Gospel everwhere<br/>
<strike>upon the new broken ground of</strike> ^in^ this prolific field</p>

<p>On the 25th the time had come for<br/>
me again to take leave of the Saints in my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]<br/>
field of labour. I wrote an address to Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] baptized one and confirmed two and after<br/>
Visiting the Saints until midnight I took the parting<br/>
hand with them and started on my journey at 12 o'clock<br/>
at night.</p>

<p>I rode from [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] at night in<br/>
a cart to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] 15 miles took coach and thence 40 miles<br/>
to [[Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England|Wolverhampton]]. Here I rode 2 miles by the omnibus<br/>
to the railroad Station and travelled by rail 30 miles<br/>
to Whitmore Station where I again took omnibus 9 miles<br/>
to [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]] and then rode in a gig to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]].</p>",
42828.0,301,,"<p>of the Saints. In thy land thousands of the Saints of God <br/>
have been driven from place to place county to county and <br/>
State to State and the blood of martyrs has been spilt <br/>
for the testimony of Jesus: and when thy rulers have been <br/>
petitioned for the redress of the wrongs of the Lord's people <br/>
and thy citizens they have turned a deaf ear in their crys<br/>
Therefore O America! thou art weighed in the balance <br/>
and found wanting. From this time forth perplexity<br/>
shall rest upon thee and confusion in thy government <br/>
wisdom righteousness and truth shall depart from thy <br/>
rulers and fully sit in thy Congress and thy shame shall <br/>
be known among the nations of the earth. It shall be<br/>
a vexation to understand the report of the sorrow and<br/>
woe that shall come upon thee by sword fire tempest <br/>
earthquakes and pestilence from the hands of God <br/>
until thy government is broken up and thou art destroyed <br/>
as a nation from under Heaven. From this hour <br/>
shall these things come upon thee and shall not cease <br/>
until the whole is accomplished and fulfilled upon <br/>
thy head""</p>

<p>Elder Cordon was appointed by the meeting<br/>
to represent the Conference of the Staffordshire Potteries at the<br/>
General Conference of the British Mission to be held at<br/>
[[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] Oct 6th 1840.</p>

<p>The Conference then adjourned till the 28th<br/>
of the next Dec. and was closed by singing and prayer</p>

<p>In the afternoon a council of the officers meet<br/>
when Willford Woodruff addressed them at length and gave<br/>
much counsel and advise. There were five baptized after<br/>
the conference meeting and the Spirit and blessing of the<br/>
Lord was with us throughout the day</p>

<p>President Willford Woodruff<br/>
Clerk [[Osmond Shaw|Osmond Shaw]]</p>",
42828.0,303,,"<p>Moved by Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and seconded by Elder [[William Hill Pitt|Pitt]] that [[Richard Bates|Richard<br/>
Bates]] be ordained a Priest in the [[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] Branch</p>

<p>[Moved and seconded] by [[Robert Williams|Robert Williams]] and Elder Pitt that [[John Sheffield|John Sheffield]]<br/>
be ordained a Teacher at [[Bedford, Bedfordshire, England|Bedford]]</p>

<p>[Moved and seconded] by Elder Kimball and brother [[John Griffiths|Griffith]] that brother <br/>
[[A. Painter|A Painter]] be ordained a Teacher at Woolwich.</p>

<p>These motions were carried unanimously and those present <br/>
were then ordained under the hands of Elders Kimball <br/>
Woodruff and [[Lorenzo Snow|Snow]]</p>

<p>Afterwards Elder Kimball moved and <br/>
Elder Woodruff seconded that Elder Lorenzo Snow be <br/>
appointed President of this Conference and to take the <br/>
Superintendency of the Church in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]</p>

<p>Much valuable instruction was <br/>
given by Elders Kimball and Woodruff in relation to <br/>
the duties of official members and afterwards it was <br/>
moved by Elder Kimball and seconded by Elder <br/>
Snow that this conference be adjourned till Sunday <br/>
the 16 of May 1841; after which the Conference closed. <br/>
<strike>duly</strike>.</p>

<p>President Wilford Woodruff<br/>
Clerk Dr [[William Copeland|Wm. Copeland]]</p>

<p>During this Conference meeting we also broke bread<br/>
with the Saints and confirmed four at 1/2 past 1<br/>
o'clock in the evening ^we meet again^ and had the largest congregation <br/>
which had assembled at our preaching place. One came <br/>
forward for baptism</p>

<p>This was a day which we had <br/>
long desired to see for we had laboured exceedingly<br/>
hard to establish a Church in London and at <br/>
times it seemed as though we should have to give <br/>
it up but by holding on to the work of our Divine <br/>
Master and claiming the promises of God we <br/>
were now to leave an established London Conference<br/>
with a prosperous Church planted in the Metropolis <br/>
under the care of our beloved brother Lorenzo Snow</p>",
42828.0,351,,"<p>are fixed and unalterable. For instance, He set the Sun the<br/>
moon and the Stars in the heavens and gave them their laws <br/>
conditions and bounds which they cannot pass except by his <br/>
commands. They all move in perfect harmony in their sphere <br/>
and order and are as wonders lights and signs unto us</p>

<p>""The sea also has its bounds which it cannot <br/>
pass. God has set many signs in the earth as well as in <br/>
the heavens. For instance the oaks of the forest the fruit of <br/>
the tree, the herb of the field all bear a sign that seed hath <br/>
been planted there, for it is a decree of the Lord that every <br/>
tree fruit or herb bearing seed shall bring forth after its own <br/>
kind and cannot come forth after any other law.""</p>

<p>Upon the same principle do I contend that <br/>
baptism is a sign ordained of God for every believer in <br/>
Christ to take upon himself in order to enter into the <br/>
Kingdom of God. ""Except a man be born of water and of the <br/>
Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God said the <br/>
Saviur</p>

<p>""As it is a sign and commandment which <br/>
God hath set for man to enter into his Kingdom those <br/>
who seek to enter in by any other way will seek in vain<br/>
God will not receive them neither will the angels acknowledge<br/>
their work as accepted for they have not taken <br/>
upon themselves those ordinances and signs which <br/>
God ordained for men to receive in order to receive <br/>
celectial glory. God has decreed that all who will <br/>
not obey his voice shall not escape the damnation <br/>
of hell. And what is the damnation of hell? Why to go <br/>
and be numbered with that society who have not obeyed <br/>
His commands.</p>

<p>Baptism is a sign to God and to angels <br/>
and to Heaven that we do the will of the Father and there <br/>
is no other way ordained by God for man to come unto <br/>
Him and any other course is vain. It is the decree of <br/>
Heaven and ordained that man shall repent of all his sins<br/>
and be baptised for the remission of them.  Then he can <br/>
come to God in the name of Jesus Christ in faith <br/>
and obtain the promise of the Holy Ghost.""</p>",
42828.0,258,,"<p>The day after the Conference I baptized one<br/>
and preached at [[Tunstall, Staffordshire, England|Tunstell]] and on the next evening at [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]]<br/>
to a crowded audience and the power of God rested upon<br/>
me. Great solemnity pervaded the congregation. The <br/>
Spirit of God was moving the people and they felt that<br/>
the Lord was doing a work in their midst</p>

<p>October ^1st^ <strike>2</strike>nd I walked to [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]]<br/>
and thence to [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] where I found [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
who had just returned from [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. We then went to<br/>
[[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]] where we found brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]. After<br/>
partaking of food we went to the water and baptized<br/>
two and thence to the preaching room where we met an<br/>
overwhelming congregation. I testified to them of the<br/>
work of God and was followed by Elder Kimball. The<br/>
power of the Almighty was upon the people and they <br/>
felt that it was a day of warning and repentance. Six<br/>
were confirmed and three baptized</p>

<p>Next morning Elder Kimball and<br/>
myself arose from our bed with the power of God resting upon <br/>
us yea His Spirit was like fire shut up in our bones<br/>
I said</p>

<p><strike>O my God why is thy Spirit thus upon me? Why<br/>
<strike>i</strike>a<strike>s</strike>re <strike>t</strike>m<strike>h</strike>y eyes like a fountain? What art thou about to do<br/>
O my God that causes this thing? I ask thee Father<br/>
to tell it unto me in the name of Jesus Christ thy Son<br/>
And the Spirit of revelation came upon me and I was answered</strike></p>

<p>""Thus saith the Lord God unto thee my<br/>
servant Willford; This is my Spirit which resteth upon<br/>
thee to enlighten thy mind to show thee things to<br/>
come and not only upon thee but upon all my faithful<br/>
servants upon the face of the whole earth saith the Lord.<br/>
Mine indignation is about to be poured out without<br/>
mixture upon all the nations of the earth and they<br/>
shall not escape. The cry of the poor the widow<br/>
and the orphan ascendeth into mine ears saith the Lord<br/>
and I am about to avenge the cry of mine elect by<br/>
laying low the oppressor and executing the decree of<br/>
mine heart upon all the ungodly amongst men</p>",
42828.0,304,,"<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] on the 15th received a letter <br/>
from his wife informing us that the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
had written for the Twelve to come immediately home <br/>
for our personal safety and the next day we met <br/>
with the Church previous to our parting with the <br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] Saints</p>

<p>Greater excitement than ever prevailed <br/>
throughout London and specially in the House of <br/>
Parliament over the imprisonment of [[Alexander McLeod|M. C. Cleod]] <br/>
and the North Eastern Boundary question and <br/>
Government secured determined on war and to every <br/>
appearence hostilities between [[England|England]] and America <br/>
seemed almost certin and it appeared as much <br/>
^as^ we should do to sail from [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] before war <br/>
broke out</p>

<p>I received a letter from Elder [[William Hill Pitt|Wm<br/>
Pitt]] containing 3 pounds and informing me that <br/>
there was an appointment for me to preach in <br/>
[[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]] on the Sunday</p>

<p>Dr [[William Copeland|Copeland]] introduced us by <br/>
letter to the Overseer of the Library of Bartholimew <br/>
Hospital which we visited and was very politely <br/>
conducted by [[Dr. Lyon|Dr Lyon]] through the various<br/>
departments of the Hospital and after visiting the <br/>
Museum Lecture Rooms and other places we last <br/>
of all visited the Dissecting Rooms where there ^were^ about <br/>
twenty human bodies which the doctors were dissecting</p>

<p>On the same day I corrected <br/>
the proof sheet of our Address to the citizens of London <br/>
and in the evening our sitting room was full of Saints<br/>
as we were soon to leave London and they brought us <br/>
some money and presents for our wives and children</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we baptized <br/>
a Jew and Jewess.</p>

<p>I was unwell that night and arose next <br/>
morning quite ill but walked to the printing office <br/>
and got three throusand copies of our Address to the <br/>
Citizens of London for which I paid three guineas</p>",
42828.0,352,,"<p>""What is the sign of the healing of the sick?<br/>
The laying on of hands is the sign marked by [[James (NT)|James]] <br/>
and the custom of the ancient Saints as ordained by the <br/>
Lord; and we shall not obtain the blessing by pursuing <br/>
any other course than that which God hath marked out.</p>

<p>What if we should attempt to obtain the Holy <br/>
Ghost through any other means except the sign or <br/>
w<strike>h</strike>ay which God has appointed?  Should we obtain <br/>
it? Certainly not. All other means would fail. The <br/>
Lord says do so and so and I will give the blessing<br/>
There are certain key words and signs belonging to the <br/>
Priesthood which must be observed in order to obtain <br/>
the blessings</p>

<p>The sign of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] was to repent and <br/>
be baptised for remission of sins with the promise <br/>
of the gift of the Holy Ghost; and in no other way is <br/>
the gift of the Holy Ghost obtained</p>

<p>There is a difference between the <br/>
Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. [[Cornelius (NT)|Cornelius]]<br/>
received the Holy Ghost before he was baptised which <br/>
was the convincing power of God unto him, of the <br/>
truth of the Gospel; but he could not receive the <u>gift </u><br/>
of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptised. Had <br/>
he not taken this sign, this ordinance upon himself <br/>
the Holy Spirit which convinced him of the truth of <br/>
God would have left him until he had obeyed the <br/>
ordinance of baptism and received the gift of the Holy <br/>
Ghost by the laying on of hands according to the order <br/>
of God he could not have healed the sick nor commanded <br/>
an evil spirit to come out of a person and be obeyed for <br/>
the Spirit might say to him as to the sons of Seeney <br/>
Peter I know and [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] I know and Jesus I know but who <br/>
are you?</p>

<p>It mattereth not whether we live long <br/>
or short after we come to a knowledge of the principles<br/>
of the Gospel and obey them. I know that all men will<br/>
be damned if they do not come in the way which God </p>",
42828.0,259,,"<p>Therefore I put my Spirit upon thee and say unto thee, Lift<br/>
up they voice and spare not and call upon all men to<br/>
repent that come within the sound of thy voice and<br/>
many souls shall be given unto thee and great shall<br/>
be they reward and eternal shall be they glory saith<br/>
the Lord""</p>

<p>The people were much stirred up throughout<br/>
the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] and felt as they never felt before. I walked to<br/>
[[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] and preached to the people and the power of God rested upon<br/>
us. Three were baptized and confirmed</p>

<p>On the 5th I took coach in company of Elders<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Brother Kneadham|Needham]] for [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]. <strike>I had a touch of the<br/>
ague on the way and had</strike> of the cholera the day before</p>

<p><strike>When I</strike> <strike>a</strike>Arrived in Manchester I had an<br/>
interview with brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and many<br/>
other brethren.</p>

<p><strike>Minutes</strike><br/>
of<br/>
^At^ The General Conference<br/>
held<br/>
At Manchester<br/>
Oct. 6th 1840</p>

<p>^There were^ Present: of the Twelve Brigham Young Heber C<br/>
Kimball Willard Richards Orson Pratt [[George Albert Smith|George A<br/>
Smith]] and Willford Woodruff: also 5 High Priests 19<br/>
Elders 28 Priests 14 Teachers and 2 Deacons.</p>

<p>The meeting was called to order at 10 o'clock<br/>
by Brigham Young when it was moved by him and<br/>
seconded by Wilford Woodruff that Orsen Pratt be President<br/>
of the Conference which was carried unanimously [[George Walker|George<br/>
Walker]] chosen clerk of the day.</p>

<p>After singing and prayer there <strike>was</strike> ^were^ represented 27<br/>
Conferences besides other Churches not yet organized into</p>",
42828.0,305,,"<p>I took the parting hand of Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] who <br/>
this day left [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. But my distress and pains of <br/>
body increased throughout the day insomuch that my <br/>
friends thought that I had caught the small-pox through <br/>
administering to the daughter of brother <strike>[[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]]</strike> ^[[James George Morgan|Morgan]]^</p>

<p>Sunday I grew worse but Dr [[William Copeland|Copeland]]<br/>
coming to visit me said it was not the small pox but <br/>
a severe attack of cold and fever. He prescribed for me <br/>
and I began to recover</p>

<p>Two days after I was better though still <br/>
weak in body and only able to trace a few lines in <br/>
my Journal with a feeble hand, and I was forced to fall <br/>
back upon Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Snow]] to write for me to Elder [[Brigham Young|Young]]</p>

<p>Last evening the noble spirited and <br/>
celebrated Temperance lecturer [[James Silk Buckingham|J. S. Buckingham]] finished <br/>
his course of lectures concerning his tour through the United <br/>
States which was delivered to a crowded audience Intreating <br/>
upon the country goverment laws customs fashions <br/>
religions sects and a variety of other matters he omitted <br/>
the Mormons or Latter-day Saints although he had <br/>
informed the public he should speak upon that <br/>
subject</p>

<p>This omission was in consequence of <br/>
his having the day previous to his lecture received <br/>
a letter from Dr Copeland including one of our Addresses<br/>
to the citizens of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] which clearly showed him <br/>
that we were American citizens Elders of the Church <br/>
and in the City and should have a knowledge of <br/>
what he presented to the community concerning us</p>

<p>Early this morning Dr Copeland received <br/>
a letter from J. S. Buckingham who acknowledge his <br/>
ignorance concerning our cause and very much wished information <br/>
by obtaining our writings. So I made him a present <br/>
of the Book of Mormon the Millennial Star and other <br/>
works hoping they <strike>may</strike> ^might^ do good</p>

<p>I walked out as far as brother Corner's <br/>
and found myself very weak. Many friends came <br/>
to see me in the evening.</p>",
42828.0,353,,"<p>has appointed.</p>

<p>""As concerning the resurrection I will merely say <br/>
that all will come from the grave as they lie down whether old <br/>
or young there will not be added to their stature one cubit <br/>
neither taken from it all being raised by the power of God <br/>
having Spirit in their bodies and not blood</p>

<p>Children will be enthroned in the presence <br/>
of God and the Lamb with bodies of the same statue as they <br/>
were on earth having been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br/>
They will there enjoy a fulness of that light glory and intelligence <br/>
which is received in the celestial Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>""Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord for <br/>
they rest from their labours and their works do follow them""</p>

<p>Before closing the speaker called upon the <br/>
vast assembly to humble themselves before God and in<br/>
mighty faith prayer and fasting call upon his holy name <br/>
that the inhabitants of that city might escape the power <br/>
of the Destroyer that ridest upon the face of the earth and <br/>
that the Holy Ghost may rest upon them and the earth <br/>
be sanctified under their feet.</p>

<p>After the close of the meeting the Prophet <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] informed the congregation that he should attend to <br/>
the ordinance of baptism in the river near his house <br/>
at 2 o'clock, and at the appointed hour the bank of the <br/>
Mississippi was lined with a multitude of people and <br/>
President Joseph Smith went forth into the river and <br/>
baptized with his own hands about 80 persons for the <br/>
remission of sins and what added joy to the occasion <br/>
was that the first person baptized was Mr. [[Lorenzo D. Wasson|L. D Wason]] <br/>
a nephew of sister [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma Smith]] and he was the <br/>
first of her kindred who had embraced the Gospel</p>

<p>At the close of this interesting scene the <br/>
administrator lifted up his hands toward heaven and <br/>
implored the blessing of God to rest upon the people <br/>
and verily the Spirit of God did rest upon the multitude <br/>
to the joy and consolation of our hearts.</p>

<p>After baptism the congregation again <br/>
reprised to the grove near the Temple to attend to </p>",
42828.0,260,,"<p>Conferences. The representation stood as follows:</p>

<p>Conferences and Churches 41<br/>
<strike>&amp;</strike> with members 3626; Elders 81 Priests 222</p>

<p>Teachers 74; Deacons 26.<br/>
This was an increase since the last Conference of the<br/>
British Mission of Members 1113; Elders 25 Priests 96</p>

<p>Teachers 15; Deacons 13.</p>

<p>After the transaction of much other business the<br/>
meeting was dismissed by prayer</p>

<p>President, Orson Pratt<br/>
Clerk [[George Walker|George Walker]].</p>

<p>Next day October 7th I sat in council with the<br/>
Twelve and many other officers at the Millennial<br/>
Star Office and in the evening we all attended a<br/>
discussion held at the Carpenter's Hall between a Mr<br/>
T [blank space] and Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]] on the one side<br/>
to prove the Book of Mormon not true and baptism<br/>
non essential to salvation. Elder Cordon sustained the<br/>
affirmative. The discussion was before 1500 people<br/>
In lighting the chandeliers before the meeting 12 of the<br/>
glasses bursted. During the day I filled two<br/>
mamouth sheets with an account of my travels from<br/>
Montrose to the present time to send by the hand of<br/>
Elder [[Samuel Mulliner|Mulliner]] to [[Ebenezer Robinson|E. Robinson]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith]]<br/>
editors of the ""Times and Seasons""</p>

<p>In Council with the Twelve next<br/>
day at the house of [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and on the following<br/>
Father [[Peter Melling|Peter Melling]] Patriarch of the Church of England<br/>
bestowed a patriarchal blessing upon my head and also two<br/>
days after became the mother of a<strike>s</strike> fine <strike>a</strike> son <strike>as I ever</strike><br/>
<strike>saw</strike>. He was named [[Heber John Richards|Heber John Richards]]</p>

<p>This was Sunday Oct 11th and we held<br/>
our asked meetings and in the evening Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]</p>",
42828.0,306,,"<p>I spent the 25 in paying my last visit <br/>
to the Saints in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and preparing for my <br/>
departure and in the evening I preached for the last <br/>
time in London before my return to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Next day I parted <strike>with</strike> ^from^ Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo<br/>
Snow]] and the London Saints and took train at the <br/>
Great Western Station for [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]]. I rode by rail <br/>
to [[Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, England|Wolton Basset]] eighty miles and then took coach 36<br/>
miles to [[Bath, Somerset, England|Bath]]. The road was very bad</p>

<p>Bath is the most striking place<br/>
to the eye of the Traveller that I ever saw. The city <br/>
extends to the summit of the high hills—Beechen <br/>
Clift and Bacon Hill and fills the valley between <br/>
The city is a very ancient <strike>antique</strike> looking place and <br/>
very picturesquely situated</p>

<p>I again took train at Bath to <br/>
Bristol and arriving called at No 12 Redcliff Crescent <br/>
Bedminster Parish where I found Elder [[Thomas Kington|Thomas <br/>
Kington]] and all his household and also Elder [[William Hill Pitt|Pitt]]<br/>
all of whom I was glad to meet.</p>

<p>The city of Bristol is a noted<br/>
place and one of [[England|England]]'s <strike>capital</strike> ^principal^ cities. Here I found <br/>
a small branch of the Church of Latter day Saints<br/>
raised up numbering thirteen souls.</p>

<p>On Sunday though still labouring <br/>
under a sever cold I preached for the first time in <br/>
the city of Bristol in the afternoon and evening. I <br/>
preached in the Theatre which was crowded to overflowing <br/>
with persons to hear me. There was good attention <br/>
paid and I felt that many souls would embrace the <br/>
work in Bristol</p>

<p>Next day was the first of <br/>
March and</p>

<p>My Birthday</p>

<p>This was the first day of Spring and I was 34 <br/>
years of age. My severe cold continued to afflict me <br/>
much. I spent the day with brother Kington and <br/>
the next ^(2<sup>nd</sup>)^ was somewhat better when I again preached</p>",
42828.0,354,,"<p>the ordinance of confirmation; and notwithstanding that<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] had spoken in the open air and stood in the water<br/>
and baptized so many about 56 of those baptized<br/>
received confirmation under his hands and during the<br/>
intermission of the meetings there was probably as<br/>
many more baptized and confirmed for their dead relatives<br/>
at the font by the Twelve. [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]] baptized about<br/>
40 and I assisted in confirming 20. It was truly an<br/>
interesting day.</p>

<p>On the Sunday following a large<br/>
assembly met in the grove near the Temple when<br/>
Elder [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] addressed the assembly and<br/>
was followed by the Prophet Joseph who proved from<br/>
the Bible the doctrine of baptism for the dead.</p>

<p>At the close the congregation again<br/>
assembled upon the bank of the river and Joseph went<br/>
into the water and baptized all who came unto him<br/>
As I considered it my privilege to be re-baptized for<br/>
the remission of sins not having had the benefit of<br/>
the ordinance since administered to me by Elder [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah<br/>
Pulsipher]] when I entered the church I went forth into<br/>
the river and was baptized under the hands of Joseph<br/>
the Prophet. Likewise did [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and many<br/>
others and Joseph called upon me to assist him and<br/>
I did so baptizing twelve. Then the Prophet lifted<br/>
up his hands to heaven and blessed the people and<br/>
the Spirit of God rested upon the congregation. And<br/>
after the multitude had gathered again to the grove<br/>
Elder Taylor and myself were confirmed ^by the laying on of hands^ <strike>with the gift of</strike><br/>
<strike>the Holy Ghost</strike> and we then commenced <strike>to confer the<br/>
like blessing upon others</strike> confirming others.</p>

<p>On the next day Elder [[Lyman Wight|Lyman<br/>
Wight]] landed in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with about one hundred and<br/>
seventy Saints mostly from [[England|England]] and three thousand<br/>
dollars worth of property for the benefit of the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]<br/>
and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]]</p>",
42828.0,261,,"<p>preached to about 1500 persons. We commenced a letter historical and<br/>
religions to [[Ebenezer Robinson|E Robinson]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith]]</p>

<p><strike>Next day Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]] [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A Smith]] and myself purchased a broad cloth cloak just alike. I<br/>
spent some portion of the day in reading to proof sheet of the Book <br/>
of Mormon: so also I did the day following</strike></p>

<p>The work of God had progressed in the town of<br/>
[[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] the Elders had preached in the streets and the ministers<br/>
of the day especially the Methodists were full of malice and the<br/>
spirit of persecution was manifesting</p>

<p>I parted with Brother Richards, Young<br/>
and Kimball and took coach to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] on the 14th and<br/>
on the morning arose refreshed by sleep and better in body<br/>
than I had been on the previous day.</p>

<p>But my mind was troubled for the Spirit<br/>
manifested much discomfort and persecution among the Saints<br/>
throughout [[Europe|Europe]] and America and that many willfull<br/>
away: also that the ""Powers that be"" in America will rise up<br/>
against the Church and that it will be again driven and<br/>
that while trouble lay in the future before the people of<br/>
God greater calamities awaited the world</p>

<p>This same spirit rested at that time upon<br/>
the Elders and Saints generally in the British Mission and<br/>
there was mourning because thereof and multitudes of<br/>
the Saints were receiving testimonies of the clouds which were<br/>
gathering over the Church afterwards over the whole world<br/>

<p>There is no doubt that the Lord was beginning<br/>
at this time to manifest what in a few years afterwards<br/>
completed the blacken written page of our history in the cruel<br/>
martardom of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] the Prophet and<br/>
Patriarch of the Church and the merciless extermination<br/>
of the Saints from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

were many present and as before good attention was paid</p>

<p>The follow day ^(3<sup>mch</sup>)^ I took a walk with <br/>
Brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] through the city <strike>of Bristol</strike>; after which we <br/>
visited the suspension bridge then being errected across the <br/>
river [[River Avon, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Avon]] at St Vincent's Rocks Clifton</p>

<p>This Suspension Bridge is 100 feet high <br/>
and 700 feet in length. There was a bar and two ropes <br/>
extending across from pillar to pillar and persons could <br/>
only pass over in a basket one or two at a time. This <br/>
basket goes on rollers or wheels and almost with the speed <br/>
of a steem engine. I saw several pass over in this way</p>

<p>At this place there were some of the greatest <br/>
curiosities in the petrified stones formed from the various <br/>
shells fish worms and other living creatures of the sea which <br/>
had been transformed into fossils of beautiful figures and <br/>
colours. I purchassed some small specimens and after<br/>
walking over and viewing the sea we returned and having a <br/>
look <strike>of</strike> ^at^ the Great Western—the first steem ship which <br/>
crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].</p>

<p>After we had returned home I went <br/>
to the water and baptized a lady by the name of <br/>
[[Elizabeth Howells|Howell]] and confirmed her at the room where we had <br/>
a good time. I laid my hands upon many and <br/>
blessed them. I blessed Elder Kington and all his <br/>
household.</p>

<p>Next day ^(4<sup>th</sup>)^ I parted from the Saints<br/>
in Bristol and took coach and rode to the ""passage""<br/>
over the river [[River Severn, England|Severn]] which I crossed in a passenger <br/>
boat and again took coach to the town of [[Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales|Cheapstow]]<br/>
Monmouthshire Wales. I arrived here at 11 o'clock &amp; <br/>
spent three hours in this noted town. I visited the <br/>
old famous Cheapstow Castle in which it is said that <br/>
[[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell]] was imprisoned for a season. This <br/>
castle is very antique and partly in ruins and there <br/>
are many of the same kind in [[Wales|Wales]] built for <br/>
defence against the English but it is evident from <br/>
their construction situation and location that they were </p>",

General Conference of the Church in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
April 6, 1842</p>

<p>The day was rainy and the Conference did not<br/>
meet until 1 o'clock p.m. President [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] occupied<br/>
the time mostly through the remainder of this day giving<br/>
instruction.</p>

<p>The following morning was also rainy<br/>
and the Conference did not re-assemble until 1 o'clock in<br/>
the afternoon.</p>

<p>A variety of subjects was presented to the<br/>
congregation by the First Presidency and the Twelve, and<br/>
those who desired to be ordained to the office of Elder<br/>
were called upon to come forward and give in their names<br/>
Many obeyed the call.</p>

<p>The sun arose pleasantly on the next<br/>
day and Conference continued at 10 o'clock in the morning<br/>
Elder [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] Presidents [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] &amp; [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]<br/>
and others spoke.</p>

<p>Then those who were to be ordained<br/>
Elders were requested to withdraw by themselves from<br/>
the congregation and they did so and six of the Twelve<br/>
namely [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
Lyman Wight [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and<br/>
myself went forward and ordained two hundred and <br/>
seventy five to the office of Elders.</p>

<p>This was truly an interesting time. More<br/>
Elders were ordained on this day than were ever before in<br/>
the Church of Latter-day Saints <strike>ordained</strike> in one day.</p>

<p>While this was going on Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] was from<br/>

of the Elders and Saints from the beginning</p>

<p>Soon indeed were the forebodings of the<br/>
Spirit concerning the dark and tempesteous clouds looming<br/>
in the future fulfilled in the rapid development of<br/>
events monumentous to the church and the whole world<br/>
First came the troubles of Saints at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] ending<br/>
with the dark and bloody page in our history of assassin<br/>
and extermination of the Saints from the civilized world<br/>
Quickly followed the rising of all [[Europe|Europe]] in revolution and<br/>
from that to the awful struggle between the North and<br/>
South such a rapid succession of great startling &amp; dire<br/>
events enough to fill in the history of the half a dozen <br/>
centuries.</p>

<p>I left the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]] on<br/>
the 16th with Bro [[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] and preached in [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]<br/>
that night which was the first time I ever preached<br/>
in that great town. At this time there were four<br/>
Saints in Birmingham and several others ready for <br/>
baptism. I felt that there would be a great work<br/>
done in that town.</p>

<p>Next day I took the rail at<br/>
Birmingham at 10 o'clock A.M. and arrived in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]<br/>
at 3 o'clock P.M. At the station I took the omnibus<br/>
to brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] where I found Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
We were glad to meet with each other once more.</p>

<p>We hired lodgings—board and sitting<br/>
room at No 40 Iron Monger Row [[St. Luke|St Luke's]]. Everything<br/>
was dear and we found that with the greatest economy<br/>
we could not do with much less than a pound per week<br/>
for each.</p>

<p>What few Saints were in London<br/>
at that time were very poor and not able to assist<br/>
us but we hoped the Lord would soon open the way<br/>
in that great Babylon of the nation that His work<br/>
might roll forth. It was however certainly the darkest<br/>
prospect before us of any place I had ever been in since</p>",

<p>From thence by coach 16 miles to [[Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales|Monmouth]] <br/>
the capital of [[Monmouthshire, Wales|Monmouthshire]] through an exceedingly <br/>
mountaineous country. Much of the route was by the <br/>
windings of the [[River Wye, Monmouthshire, Wales|River Y]] [blank space] The coachman ran his <br/>
hor<strike>e</strike>ses down the mountains which would have <br/>
endangered out lives had not the roads been good</p>

<p>When I arrived at Monmouth Elder <br/>
[[James George Morgan|James Morgan]] was waiting my coming and had given <br/>
out an appointment for me to preach in the town at 7 o'clock<br/>
at the house of [[Robert Houston Davis|Robert Davis]]. There was a crowded <br/>
meeting and many could not get into the house. Four offered <br/>
themselves for baptism. The Spirit witnessed to me <br/>
that there would many embrace the Gospel in Monmouthshire<br/>
and I said, ""The harvest is great and the labourers <br/>
few.</p>

<p><strike>I arose in the morning ^5<sup><u>th</u></sup>^ refreshed <br/>
by sleep and having taken breakfast with [[Mr. Maston|Mr Maston]]<br/>
I walked ten miles throug^h^ mud and water in a driving <br/>
March rain storm to sister [[Mary Morgan|Mary Morgan]] at [[Little Garway, Herefordshire, England|little<br/>
Garway]] where I found a pleasant family of the Saints.<br/>
We were drenched with rain but found a good fire &amp; <br/>
spent the day comfortably and in the evening I had an <br/>

[[Little Garway, Herefordshire, England|Garway]] Conference<br/>
^held^ March 8th 1841</p>",

Smith]] occupied the Stand and <strike>wa</strike>were followed by [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] with<br/>
a few remarks and the Conference closed.</p>

<p>On the following day the Saints in<br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] assembled at the house of President [[William Marks|Marks]] to<br/>
pay their last respects to the remains of Ephraim his<br/>
son.</p>

<p>A large procession formed two by two<br/>
and walked to the Grove where a great concourse of the<br/>
citizens <strike>h</strike>a<strike>a</strike>s<strike>i</strike>sembled.</p>

<p>The Prophet Joseph spoke upon the<br/>
occassion with much feeling. Among his remarks<br/>
he said:</p>

<p>""It is a very Solemn <strike>and awful</strike> time.<br/>
I never felt more solemn. It calls to my mind the<br/>
death of my oldest brother who died in [[New York|New York]] and <br/>
of my youngest brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Carlos]] who died in Nauvoo<br/>
It has been hard for me to live on Earth and see<br/>
those young men upon whom we have leaned as<br/>
support, and comfort taken from us in the glory<br/>
of their youth. I have sometimes felt that I should<br/>
have been more reconciled to have been called myself if<br/>
God had so willed it. Yet I know we ought to be still<br/>
and know that it is of Him and be reconciled.</p>

<p>""All is right. It will be but a short<br/>
time before we shall all in like manner be called. It<br/>
may be the case with me as well as with you. Some<br/>
have supposed that brother Joseph could not die but this<br/>
is a mistake. It is true there have been times<br/>
when I have had the promise of my life to accomplish<br/>
such a such things; but having accomplished those<br/>
things I have not at present any lease of my life and<br/>
am as liable to die as other men""</p>

<p>The Prophet made many other remarks<br/>
of a similar kind and President [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] closed<br/>
The body was then conveyed to the grave in solumn<br/>
silence and each as they passed by droped a branch<br/>
of evergreen into the grave</p>",
42828.0,263,,"<p>I had entered the vineyard. But the Lord was with us and<br/>
we were not discouraged.</p>

<p>Sunday we met with the Saints at Bro<br/>
[[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] three times read in the Book of Mormon gave instruction and<br/>
broke bread unto them. We had a good time though there was<br/>
only about half a dozen present. I felt the Spirit bear testimony<br/>
that there would be a work done in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]</p>

<p>I fell asleep having retired to rest in good<br/>
season and slept until <strike>12 o'clock</strike> (midnight) when I awoke and <br/>
meditated upon the things of God until 3 o'clock in the morning<br/>
and while forming a determination to warn the people in London<br/>
and overcome the power of darkness by the assistance of God<br/>
a person appeared unto me whom I consider was the Prince<br/>
of Darkness. He made war with me and attempted to<br/>
take my life. He caught me by the throat and nearly<br/>
choked me to death. He wounded me in my forehead<br/>
and I also wounded him in a number of places in the head<br/>
As he was about to overcome me I prayed to the Father<br/>
in the name of Jesus Christ for help. I then had power<br/>
over him and he left me though much wounded. Afterwards<br/>
<strike>a</strike> ^three^ persons dressed in white came to me and prayed with<br/>
me and I was immediately healed of all my wounds and<br/>
delivered of all my troubles</p>

<p>Next day [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and<br/>
myself spent several interesting hours in visiting the <br/>
[[British Museum, London, Middlesex, England|British Museum]]. In company with the rest of<br/>
my brethren of the Twelve who attended the General Conference<br/>
of July I had visited the [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] Museum and <br/>
to day I had a greater treat in spending a few hours<br/>
in one of the most worthy places in the world for a<br/>

After the representation it was motioned that <br/>

and [[Thomas Rough|Thomas Rough]] Teacher

<p>These were ordained under the hands <br/>
of Elders Woodruff and Richards.</p>

<p>The meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock and <br/>
one was baptized.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Elder Levi Richards <br/>
spoke and I followed him. After meeting the Saints <br/>
contributed one pound to help me and I sold them 3 <br/>
Books of Mormon and fifty Addresses to the Citizens <br/>
of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. I then walked 5 miles with brother <br/>
Richards to brother [[John Holley|Holley's]] and spent the night. This <br/>
was the first time I had seen Brother Levi for <br/>
about two years</p>

<p>Next day in company of Elders Levi <br/>
Richards and [[Thomas Pitt|Thomas Pitt]] I walked to the city of [[Hereford, Herefordshire, England|Hereford]] <br/>
where Elders [[William Kay|Kay]] and others had been preaching. <strike>and</strike><br/>
<strike>the people were much stirred up</strike></p>

[[William Law|William Law]] addressed the assembly for about an hour.</p>

<p>Then [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Seer arose in the power<br/>
of God and reproved and rebuked the wickedness before the<br/>
people in the name of the Lord. ""I wish to say a few<br/>
words to suit the condition of the general mass and I shall<br/>
speak with the authority of the Priesthood in the name of the<br/>
Lord God which shall prove a savior of life unto life or of<br/>
death unto death.</p>

<p>""Notwithstanding this congregation profess <br/>
to be Saints yet I stand in the midst of all characters and all<br/>
classes of men.</p>

<p>""If you wish to go where God is you must<br/>
be like Him or possess the principles which he possesses<br/>
for if we are not drawing towards God in principle we<br/>
are going from Him and drawing towards the Devil.</p>

are like God. I have searched mine and feel to repent <br/>
of my ^all^ sins.</p>

<p>""We have thieves among us, adulterers<br/>
liars hypocrites. If God should speak from heaven<br/>
He would command you not to steal nor to commit<br/>
adultery nor to coveet not deceive but to be faithful over<br/>

descend to the Devil and lose our knowledge and without<br/>
knowledge we cannot be saved.</p>

of any of his time. These he directed should be<br/>
offered after his death to the British Parliament. He<br/>
died in 1753 and the offer was accepted and the act<br/>
of 26 [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] which directed the purchase of the collection<br/>
of Sir Hans Sloane also directed the purchase of<br/>
the Harleian Library of Manuscripts and enacted<br/>
that the Cottonian Library which had been given<br/>
to the Government in the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] should<br/>
with these form one general collection. In the<br/>
spring following the death of Sir Hans <br/>
Montague House was purchased as a repository for the whole<br/>
and it was determined that the new institution<br/>
should bear the name of</p>

<p>The [[British Museum, London, Middlesex, England|British Museum]]</p>

<p>Till the arrival of the Egyptian Antiquities from<br/>
Alexander in 1801 Montague House was sufficient<br/>
for the reception of its acquisitions. Most of the<br/>
Egyptian monuments were too massive for a private<br/>
dwelling and this first suggested the necessity of<br/>
an additional building which was rendered still more<br/>
indispensible by the purchase of the Townly Marbles<br/>
in 1805. A gallery adequite for the reception of<br/>
both was completed in 1807 and in 1823 upon the<br/>
donation of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George]] the IV of the Library of [[George III of Great Britain|George III]]<br/>
Government ordered the eviction of the present building<br/>
known as The British Museum of which the old<br/>
building Montague House forms the general front</p>

has been added unto until the British Museum when<br/>
we visited it covered five acres of ground</p>

every apartment of this famous Museum which<br/>
contains the greatest collection in the world yet I felt<br/>
more deeply interested in that part called the Gallery<br/>

new story it had been published for <strike>two</strike> ^seven^ years throughout <br/>
the United States and also <strike>throughout</strike> ^in^ [[England|England]]. This caussed <br/>
a great uproar for while some were driving the <br/>
man out of the place for lying others were crowding<br/>
around Elder Richards and [[William Kay|Kay]] to hear them preach<br/>
The crowd however was so exited that they left the <br/>
ground with hundreds following them.</strike></p>

<p>There never was a time when the <br/>
people were so much stirred up and eager to hear the <br/>
Latter-day Saints <strike>than</strike> ^as^ at the present and it was <br/>
expected that we should not get through the city without <br/>
having crowds around us. We did however and had <br/>
a view of [[Hereford, Herefordshire, England|Hereford]] Cathedral as we passed along and <br/>
reached Sister Buftons</p>

<p>There was at this time a small <br/>
Branch of the Church at Hereford numbering seven <br/>
members.</p>

<p>We parted <strike>wi</strike>from Brother [[William Hill Pitt|Pitt]] at Hereford <br/>
and continued to [[Lugwardine, Herefordshire, England|Lugwardine]] where I met with the <br/>
Church for the last time and preached from the <br/>
24 ch of Isaiah.</p>

<p>On the morrow I walked to <br/>
[[Shucknall Hill, Herefordshire, England|Shucknell Hill]] and had an interesting meeting with the <br/>
Saints and preached upon the gathering to Zion and <br/>
[[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. It as my last meeting with them <br/>
and I bid them farewell</p>

<p>Next day I walked to [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley <br/>
Hill]] and dined with Brother [[Edward Ockey|O<strike>a</strike>ckey]] whom I was <br/>
truly glad to see once more. We went together through <br/>
Standly Hill and called upon the Saints</p>

<p><strike>It was</strike> Six months had passed <br/>
since I had parted from the Churches in this region <br/>

consequently more power than many men on earth. Hence<br/>
it needs revelation to assist us and give us knowledge<br/>

of the day do not get revelation? They ask only to <br/>
consume it upon their lusts. Their hearts are corrupt and<br/>
they cloke their inequity by saying there is no more<br/>

<p>The Nauvoo Legion met on Parade on the<br/>
7th of May. The whole Legion was mustered and<br/>
it consisted of 23 companies. The Legion that day<br/>
on parade numbering not much less than 2 thousand<br/>
men and officers mostly all ^in^ well dressed uniform truly<br/>
made a splendid appearance. General Joseph Smith<br/>
had provided a sumptious dinner for the whole staff<br/>
with their ladies.</p>

under the salute of the martial band, and landed<br/>
about forty Saints mostly from [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] England.</p>

and for more than two hundred years it formed the principal<br/>
ornament of the Barberini Palace. The material of which the<br/>
vase is made is glass. The figures which are executed in relief are<br/>
of a beautiful opake white and the ground of a dark transparent<br/>
blue. This superb specimen of Greek art was deposited in the<br/>
British Museum in 1810 by the Duke of Portland</p>

<p>Among the Egyptian Antiquities are a large<br/>
number of toombs coffins mummies hi<strike>y</strike>eroglyphics &amp; papyri enough<br/>
if translated into the English language to make a hundred vols.<br/>
as large as the Bible. In this part I felt more interested<br/>
then in any thing I saw as they were from three to four<br/>
thousand years old and would no doubt if translated have<br/>
revealed many most valuable and glorious things historical<br/>
and sacred concerning the early ages of the world and of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]]<br/>

of the institutions of religion recorded by the profound and <br/>

<p><strike>From [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Stanley Hill]] we went to [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]] <br/>

she had been in Lord Summers family from a child but <br/>
was now rejected for receiving the fullness of the Gospel. Lord <br/>
Summers had since died and his son had commanded <br/>
her soon to leave his house. By letter from Elder [[Henry Glover|Glover]] <br/>
we heard that Elders [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[George Washington Joshua Adams|G. J. Adam]] had <br/>
just arrived in [[England|England]] from [[New York|New York]].</strike></p>

a child confirmed a member and administered the ordinance <br/>
of the Gospel to five sick persons; and on the morrow <br/>
I continued to [[Turkey Hall, Eldersfield, Worcestershire, England|Turkey Hall]].</p>

<p>Here on the Sunday I communed with <br/>
the Saints and preached to a large congregation upon <br/>
the gathering. I found the Saints in the region around <br/>

they were poor and had not the means</p>

the meeting was called to order by Elder Woodruff</p>

<p>There were present one of the quorum of <br/>

month I was also baptized for my mother and two brothers<br/>
This made five for whom I had been now baptized.</p>

<p>On the Sunday following which was the<br/>
29th of May I baptized in the font Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
for the restoration of his health. At the same time I was<br/>
baptized by him in behalf of my grandfather [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad Woodruff]]<br/>
and grandmother [[Dinah Woodford Woodruff|Dinah Woodruff]]; and I also baptized my<br/>
wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] for her Grandfather [[Joshua Fabyan|Joshua Fabyan]] and grandmother<br/>
[[Sarah Brackett Fabyan, b. 1740|Sarah Fabyan]] and her great-uncle [[John Fabyan, b. 1704|John Fabyan]]. At the<br/>

<p>May the 30th I was baptized under the<br/>
hands of George A Smith for my [[Samuel Thompson, b. 1709|Great grandfather]] and<br/>
[[Hannah North Thompson|great grandmother Thompson]] and for my grandfather [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot<br/>

time I baptized my wife for her uncle John Fabyan and<br/>
aunt Sally Fabyan and her uncle George Fabyan and <br/>
uncle Joseph Fabyan. I also baptized Brother [[John Benbow|John <br/>
Benbow]] for six of his dead kindred and his [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]] for<br/>
six of her dead friends.</p>

<p>On the 14th of the following month<br/>
June, I sat in council with the Twelve and we decided that<br/>
Elder [[Hiram Clark, b. 1795|Hiram Clark]] should go to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] and take the<br/>
place of Elder [[Amos Fielding|Fielding]] who was to return with his family<br/>
to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Four days afterwards the citizens of <br/>
Nauvoo both male and female to the number of many<br/>
thousands assembled in Mass Meeting at the Grove<br/>
near the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]].</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Seer arose and spoke in<br/>
great plainness concerning the corruption and wickedness of<br/>
Gen. [[John Cook Bennett|John Cook Bennett]]. He also prophesied that if<br/>
the merchants of the city and the rich did not open their<br/>
hearts and contribute to the poor they would be cursed by<br/>
the hand of God and cut off from the land of the living</p>",
42828.0,266,,"<p>Two days after we took an interesting tour called<br/>
upon several persons has a view of the Palaces of St James<br/>
and strolled into Hyde Park visited the Lowther Bazaar the<br/>
only subterranen exhibition in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. We returned home<br/>
and held a prayer meeting at brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]]</p>

<p>Next day we hired Mr. [[J. Barrett|J. Barrett's]] [[Barrett|Academy]]<br/>
King's Square Goswell Street for three months to preach<br/>
in and I went to the printer and got 500 hand bills printed<br/>
to publish our place of worship and on my return Elder<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|Smith]] presented me with three letters to read and No 10 <br/>
of the Times and Seasons. The letter from Father [[John Smith, b. 1781|John<br/>
Smith]] to his son George A. informed me of the death of<br/>
my daughter.</p>

<p>In the evening of the same day<br/>
in company of Elder George A Smith I attended a <br/>
Missionary meeting of the Wesleyan Methodist connection<br/>
in their chapel City Road. It was considered one of the greatest<br/>
Missionary meetings ever held in the City of London and<br/>
the chair was filled by the [[Thomas Johnson|Lord Mayor]]. He was<br/>
a noble looking man and the insigna of office which<br/>
hung about his neck consisted of six gold chains which<br/>
were large and heavy</p>

<p>The object of the meeting was for<br/>
the Wesleyan Methodist to send out foreign missionaries<br/>
and to make collections enough to clear themselves of<br/>
a debt of £50,000. The best talents of [[Europe|Europe]] were<br/>
gathered together on this occassion Ministers of the<br/>
Church of England and of [[Scotland|Scotland]] were present besides<br/>
numerous ministers of the Methodist connection<br/>
There was much policy manifested in this combination<br/>
of the ministers of the different churches and their<br/>
influence for the purpose of raising means.</p>

<p>I heard speeches from 10 to 12 ministers<br/>
One from the Scotch church as he arose and addressed<br/>
the chairman and meeting said</p>

<p>""My Lord and Wesleyan friends, let<br/>
my tongue cleave to my mouth and my right hand<br/>
forget its cunning when I will not take a Wesleyan by</p>",

<p>In the afternoon Conference re-assembled <br/>
and the meeting opened with the usual form after <br/>
which it was moved and carried that [[Henry Webb|Henry Webb]] be <br/>
ordained a Priest. He was ordained by Elders Levi <br/>
Richards and Willford Woodruff who afterwards gave <br/>
much instruction and counsel. This concluded the <br/>
Conference ^after^ <strike>by</strike> singing and prayer</p>

42828.0,360,,"<p>The main portion of the day was taken up with<br/>
the business of the ""Agricultral and Manufacturing Society""<br/>
which was established under the charter granted by the Legislature<br/>
with a view of helping the poor.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] also commanded the Twelve<br/>
to organize the Church more according to the law of God:<br/>
that is to require of those who come in to be settled according<br/>
to their council and also to appoint a committee to wait<br/>
upon those who arrive make them welcome and counsel<br/>
them what to do. [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]]<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] formed the <br/>
committee to settle the emigrants.</p>

<p><u>The</u> [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|<u>Nauvoo</u> <u>Masonic</u> <u>Lodge</u>]]</p>

<p>assembled at the Celebration of St. [[John (NT)|John]] on the 24th<br/>
^of June^ at 9 o'clock in the morning at the store of Joseph<br/>
Smith where the visiting brethren were received. The <br/>
procession was formed and marched to the stand in the<br/>
Grove near the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]. There were present about<br/>
six thousand persons. [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] delivered an <br/>
appropriate address and we then returned to the Lodge<br/>
where we dispersed for refreshment and re-met at<br/>
2 o'clock in Lodge capacity.</p>

<p>Sunday the 3rd of July about<br/>
six thousand persons assembled and was addressed<br/>
by Joseph the Seer from the 7th Ch. of [[Daniel (OT)|Daniel]] concerning<br/>
the Kingdom of God to be set up in the last days.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July the Nauvoo<br/>
Legion met and celebrated the day.</p>

<p>I preached in the afternoon of Sunday<br/>
the 1<strike>8</strike>7th and at the close of the meeting I went to the<br/>
font and confirmed about one hundred most of whom<br/>
were baptized for the dead.</p>

<p>The time had come when there <br/>
was again excitement throughout the land against<br/>
the Saints. This excitement had arisen partly because<br/>
the citizens of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] were disposed to exercise the</p>",
42828.0,267,,"<p>the hand and call him brother!""</p>

<p>A minister of the Church of [[England|England]] said</p>

<p>""My Lord and Wesleyan friends I wish you while looking<br/>
at the Church of England to cover her with the <br/>
cloak of charity"" . . . ""I would readily cover the imperfections<br/>
of the Wesleyan society but I know not where they are. I <br/>
would not hesitate to cover the imperfections of the Church<br/>
of [[Rome, Lazio, Italy|Rome]] were it in my power but they are all scarlet""</p>

<p>A Wesleyan minister then arose and said</p>

<p>""We are highly favoured on this occassion by having<br/>
""for our chairman the [[Thomas Johnson|Lord Mayor]] of London the chief<br/>
""Magistrate of the most renowned city in the world<br/>
""and his Lordship has like Caesar submitted himself to<br/>
""the worship and acknowledgement of Christ in this condescention<br/>
""But when rightly considered is not my Lord as highly honoured<br/>
in presiding over this vast body of respectable citizens this<br/>
evening who have met together on so important an occassion<br/>
as he would be to reign upon a throne for the angels in<br/>
heaven honour every effort that is made on earth for the<br/>
spread of the Gospel and the saving of the souls of men<br/>
My Lord and Christian friends How did the ancient<br/>
Apostles prevail? They were illiterate and had neither<br/>
money nor influence and their doctrinal were unpopular<br/>
yet they established the Gospel maintained the doctrine of<br/>
Christ and caused the nations to tremble; but this was<br/>
all by the power of God and not of men. My Lord<br/>
our circumstances are different from theirs. We have<br/>
influence and wealth we have splendid chapels and respectable<br/>
bodies and our numbers are many yet if God is not with<br/>
us we cannot prevail."" (I shouted Amen)</p>

<p>Thus speech after speech was made until<br/>
10 o'clock when a collection was made after which the<br/>
Lord Mayor arose and addressed about 3000 persons<br/>
in the city Road Chapel which was the first chapel ever<br/>
built by the immortal [[John Wesley|John Wesley]]. The Lord Mayor<br/>
said</p>

<p>""It is with pleasure that I have been permitted<br/>
to preside over this respectable body this evening on so</p>",
42828.0,313,,"<p>We had a very interesting time at the Conference <br/>
and a large assembly of the Saints. It was the last ^time^ that <br/>
I should attend in that part of my old and beloved field of labour <br/>
during my present mission to [[England|England]] and whether or not <br/>
I should ever meet here a conference assembly of Saints <br/>
again was one of the secrets of my future left to time to <br/>
reveal.</p>

<p>We had held our meeting without disturbance<br/>
from the mob who were present for they were kept quiet <br/>
by the Police in attendance, who were in disguise, <strike>but</strike><br/>
after the closing of the conference meeting a scene followed <br/>
not easily described in which the Saints and myself were<br/>
the actors.</p>

<p>I had escaped the mobbing of the <br/>
wicked but now if I may so describe it I was fairly <br/>
mobbed by the brethren and sisters</p>

<p>No sooner had the meeting closed than <br/>
multitudes of the Saints crowded around me and hands <br/>
were presented me on every side to bid me farewell<br/>
Many called for me to bless them before I departed, they <br/>
cried out ""Lay hands upon me and heal me before you <br/>
go"" One came with, ""Brother Woodruff I am turned out of <br/>
doors for my religion. What shall I do?"" Another with <br/>
""I am ready to go to Zion but my wife wont go with <br/>
me. Shall I leave her to gather with the Saints?""<br/>
A wife in turn says ""My husband beats me and turns <br/>
me out of doors because I have been baptized. I have <br/>
money enough to carry me and the children to Zion <br/>
will you let me go without him?"" ""Brother Woodruff<br/>
my mother is over 80 years of age and has willed me <br/>
60 pounds at her death but will not emigrate with me <br/>
Must I stay for her to die or leave her now to go <br/>
with the Saints?"" One said, ""I have sold my little <br/>
place and shall have 30 pounds to-morrow but must go <br/>
out into the street. I have not enough to carry my family <br/>
to America. Can you help me to a few pounds or tell <br/>
me what to do? And an Elder cried out ""How much <br/>
longer must I preach in England before you will let me</p>",
42828.0,361,,"<p>rights which the Constitution of the United States guaranteed<br/>
to them in common with all other citizens—namely in<br/>
attending the elections and voting for whom they pleased<br/>
It was also partly in consequence of [[John Cook Bennett|John C. Bennet]] who had<br/>
been cut off the Church for his wick^ed^ness and corrupt deeds<br/>
and had gone forth into the regions around stiring up strife<br/>
against the Church by lying against [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and others.</p>

<p>At this date the office of the Times and<br/>
Seasons needed a new stock of Paper and other materials<br/>
for printing and binding which could not be purchased nearer<br/>
than [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis]] and Joseph appointed me to go to that<br/>
city to purchase the new supply.</p>

<p>So on the 23rd of July I went up to<br/>
the Steamboat landing to watch for a boat and tarried<br/>
near by for four days at brother [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wights]] when<br/>
myself and Messrs [[Thomas Ashton|Ashton]] and [[Freedom Moulton|Moulton]] took passage on<br/>
board the Galena.</p>

<p>We found the boat heavily loaded with led<br/>
and the water being low we soon saw that we should <br/>
have a slow journey.</p>

<p>The boat crossed to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] and<br/>
unloaded into lighters and the hands had a tremendious<br/>
fight while doing so.</p>

<p>Next day we sailed to [[Nashville, Dubuque County, Iowa Territory|Nashville]] and<br/>
over the rapids to [[Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Keokurk]] and ran upon the rocks<br/>
many times.</p>

<p>Next morning we left Keokurk in rainy<br/>
weather and after we had passed Tully the boat ran upon<br/>
a sand bank and lay till next morning when we got<br/>
off and after passing [[Marion City, Marion County, Missouri|Marion City]] the boat ran upon<br/>
another Sand bank which hindered her course for<br/>
six hours.</p>

<p>I took a severe cold which settled into<br/>
the Bilious Fever and was exceedingly ill the remainder of the<br/>
journey.</p>

<p>We arrived in St Louis on the 2nd of<br/>
A^u^gust. I had suffered severely and my face was frightfully<br/>
spotted by Musketoes</p>",
42828.0,268,,"<p>important an occassion the memory of which will be indelibly<br/>
fixed upon my mind as one of the most pleasing events<br/>
of my life and I trust I shall ever be as ready to perform<br/>
every duty required of me by the citizens of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]<br/>
as I have been to meet with our Wesleyan friends this<br/>
evening."" The house rang with applauds.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all this who<br/>
can imagine my feelings? None only those in like<br/>
circumstances to myself. Here was I with a mission<br/>
and a message from the Lord to the inhabitants of<br/>
London and stood in their midst ready to deliver<br/>
it as soon as He should open the way yet I<br/>
was as little known to them as was [[Jonah (OT)|Jonah]] to<br/>
the citizens of [[Nineveh|Ninevah]] while in the whale's belly<br/>
Notwithstanding this great display of talant power<br/>
and policy to send missionaries to the heathen<br/>
they as much needed an humble messenger of<br/>
God to teach them the Gospel of Jesus Christ in<br/>
its primative character as Ninevah did a Prophet<br/>
to cry repentance unto its inhabitants. I retired home<br/>
alone reflecting upon these things.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we circulated<br/>
and posted our hand bills which contained the following</p>

<p>copy of the First placard of the Church in London</p>

<p>""He that judgeth a matter before he heareth isnot wise""</p>

<p>The Latter Day Saints meet for public<br/>
worship at Mr. [[J. Barrett|J. Barretts]] [[Barrett|Academy]] 57 King's<br/>
Square Goswell Road — (entrance door in President St)<br/>
every Sabbath at 3 and half past 6 o'clock p.m.: also<br/>
on Tuesday and Thursday Evenings each week at Eight<br/>
o'clock</p>

<p>Lectures</p>

<p>will be delivered by Elders Woodruff and Smith<br/>
(late from America)<br/>
who respectfully invite the citizens of London to attend.</p>

<p>The first principles of the Everlasting Gospel<br/>
in its fulness.</p>",
42828.0,314,,"<p>go to America"" ""Brother Woodruff wont you come and preach <br/>
in [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|Cheltenham]]?"" ""My head is in great pain Wont you heal<br/>
me?"" ""I want you to consecrate these bottles of oil before <br/>
you go"" ""Will you write to me?"" ""I have been waiting <br/>
a long while to get a chance to speak to you"". ""Good <br/>
by"" ""Remember me to Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]]!"" ""Good by! God <br/>
bless you!""</p>

<p>Thus was I for more than an hour <br/>
after the close of the meeting assailled with the affectionate <br/>
outbursts and adieus and the host of perplexities of these <br/>
Saints who crowded around me as children to their <br/>
father. <strike>for as such in Christ they were.</strike></p>

<p>Many of the Saints parted from me <br/>
in tears and many followed me to [[Turkey Hall, Eldersfield, Worcestershire, England|Turkey Hall]] where I <br/>
spent the night and saw they filled the house until a late <br/>
hour beging counsel and instruction of me. One <br/>
of these was a Baptist Minister who had just been <br/>
baptized into the church.</p>

<p>On the morrow in company of <br/>
Elder [[John Needham|Needham]] I walked to [[Keysend Street, Berrow, Worcestershire, England|Keysend Street]] where <br/>
I preached to a crowded congregation of Saints and <br/>
on the following day I walked to [[Wind Point, Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Wind Point]]</p>

<p>On the way I went into the <br/>
Giants cave on [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]]. It was dug out of <br/>
solid rock and its dimensions are six feet by four <br/>
at the mouth 12 feet in length and seven feet in <br/>
length. The stone that covered the mouth had <br/>
rolled down the Hill.</p>

<p><strike>After viewing the Giants Cave I</strike><br/>
^where I^ visited the Saints <strike>at Wind's Point</strike> and thence <br/>
continued to [[Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Colwall]], <strike>and</strike> ^where I^ met a large congregation <br/>
of the Saints and preach to them upon the <br/>
Gathering, which everywhere now formed the burden of <br/>
my soul to the Churches I were bidding farewell. <br/>
Two of those present Elders James and [[Henry Jones|Henry Jones]] were <br/>
like Paul had been great persecutors but were now <br/>
preaching what they had once persecuted</p>

<p>I received a letter from Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]]</p>",
42828.0,362,,"<p>We arrived at 12 o clock <strike>a</strike>A.<strike>m</strike>M. and stoped at<br/>
the American House.</p>

<p>I had only 24 hours to do my<br/>
business in and after dinner notwithstanding the <br/>
fever was raging upon me I commenced and bought<br/>
my stock of paper and walked till ten o'clock at<br/>
night and went to bed very weary sick and in severe<br/>
pain and did not sleep until 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>I was awoken with the bleeding of<br/>
the nose. I lost a pint of blood and felt very weak<br/>
yet I commenced business before breakfast and got<br/>
my goods on board by 2 o'clock in the afternoon.<br/>
I took dinner and went to bed tired and sick indeed.</p>

<p>The boat started at 1 o'clock in<br/>
the evening and we arrived at [[Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Keokurk]] having had<br/>
over two days and nights of suffering. I had bled<br/>
at the nose considerable and had the canker. <strike>which<br/>
I killed with tobaco</strike>.</p>

<p>I left the boat and took stage<br/>
and arrived at [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] at the time of a Masonic<br/>
procession and the institution of a Lodge in that<br/>
place.</p>

<p>I had an interview there with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
and then crossed to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and arrived home thoroughly<br/>
pickled with the bil<strike>l</strike>ious fever.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding my state I<br/>
could not stop to rest for I found that the printing<br/>
office had stood still ten days for want of paper.</p>

<p>Extract of the Letter from my Wife<br/>
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|<u>Phebe</u>]].</p>

<p>July 18th 1840</p>

<p>My Dear Willford,</p>

<p>What will be your feelings when I <br/>
say that yesterday I was called to witness the departure<br/>
of our little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] from this world. Yes she<br/>
is gone! The relentless hand of Death has snatched her<br/>
from my embrace. But ha! she was too lovely too<br/>
kind too affectionate to live in this wicked world</p>

<p>When looking upon her I have often thought<br/>
how I should feel to part with her. I thought I could not<br/>
live without her especially in the absence of my companion<br/>
But she has gone! The Lord hath taken her home to<br/>
himself for some wise purpose. It is a trial to me<br/>
but the Lord hath stood by me in a wonderful manner<br/>
I can see and feel; and that he has taken her home and<br/>
will take better care of her than I possibly could for a<br/>
little while until I shall go and meet her.</p>",
42828.0,315,,"<p>who informed me that the work of God was rolling on in <br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and that he had baptized seven the Sunday previous <br/>
I also received a letter from Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]].</p>

<p>Next day <strike>I had an interview</strike> with Elder <br/>
[[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] <strike>and then with him</strike> ^I^ walked over [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern<br/>
Hill]] and called upon Elder [[Samuel Jones, b. 1823|Samuel Jones]]; Thence through <br/>
Great Malvern to [[Crowcutt, Worcestershire, England|Crowcat]] and held a meeting at brother <br/>
[[George Brooks|George Brooks]]' and had an interesting time with a large <br/>
number of Saints whom I had baptized about a year before</p>

<p>To [[Dunns Close, Herefordshire, England|Dunsclose]] the day after visiting <br/>
many of the Saints by the way laying hands upon the <br/>
sick and blessing and counselling others of the flock. They <br/>
all were happy to see me for I had baptized most of <br/>
them when I first opened that field of labour. ^Next day^</p>

<p>I preached at Dunsclose at the house <br/>
of [[Edward Jenkins|Edward Jinkins]] to a crowded meeting but a wicked <br/>
rabble disturbed us much and I was constrained sharply <br/>
to reprove them in the power of God</p>

<p>A very rainy day was the 20th <br/>
but accompanied with a guide I journeyed to [[Rough Leasowe, Worcestershire, England|Rough Leaser]]<br/>
and thence to [[Ridgeway Cross, Herefordshire, England|Ridgeway ^Cross^]]. Here I found Elder [[Thomas Henry Clark|Thomas Clark]]<br/>
at his stone quary. I took several speciments of curious <br/>
petrified stone formed by the water. We <strike>then</strike> walked <br/>
to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frooms' Hill]] and visited the Saints by the way</p>

<p>Sunday followed and this was the <br/>
last Sabbath I should meet the Saints in [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standly]] <br/>
and Froom's Hill.</p>

<p>At <strike>brother [[John Cole|John Coles]]</strike> Frooms Hill,<br/>
I met the Saints <strike>in the</strike> ^Sunday^ morning and had a crowded <br/>
house and in the afternoon at Standly Hill where <br/>
I communed with the Church. <strike>and</strike> <strike>a</strike>At the close of the <br/>
meeting I had a busy time shaking hands with the <br/>
Saints and parting from them many of whom wished <br/>
me to bless them and others to heal them</p>

<p>I spent the night with brother Levi <br/>
Richards at Elder [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey]] and on the morrow <br/>
we held <u>conference</u>.</p>",
42828.0,363,,"<p>I ever had in my life.</p>

<p>I had a thorough course of bilious fever<br/>
and was brought exceedingly low and for a time struggled<br/>
between life and death. Some of the time I felt like<br/>
gathering up my feet and sleeping with my fathers</p>

<p>I was confined to my house and mostly<br/>
to my bed from the 10th of August to the 1<strike>2</strike>9th of September<br/>
making forty days.</p>

<p>The Twelve came and anointed me<br/>
and laid hands upon me and I felt the testimony<br/>
that I should recover but after I began to revive I had<br/>
a relapse twice</p>

<p>In one instance I was requested to attend<br/>
a council of the Twelve in the case of [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]. I<br/>
was very weak but yet I thought I would try to meet with<br/>
them and supposed that we should meet at Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor's]]<br/>
who was also very low with the bilious fever; but on our<br/>
arrival we found him so very feeble that he was not<br/>
able to have the council at his house. So we removed<br/>
to President [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smiths]] Office.</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] conveyed me<br/>
in his carriage to the place of meeting but I had not<br/>
been in the house more than ten minutes before my<br/>
strength began to fail me. I laid down upon a bench<br/>
but no sooner was I laid down than I became unconscious<br/>
and my breath stoped.</p>

<p>My brethren raised me up and took me<br/>
to the door and with the aid of air and water I was brought<br/>
to breath again but not without a hard struggle between<br/>
life and death.</p>

<p>The brethren laid hands upon me<br/>
and Hyrum Smith prayed for my recovery and I soon<br/>
began to breathe freer but my strength was entirely gone.</p>

<p>They conveyed me home and it being<br/>
in a warm season I was much troubled for breathing<br/>
through the night. Several days elapsed before I<br/>
revived again.</p>

<p>During my sickness there had been</p>",
42828.0,270,,"<p>Yes Willford we have one little angel in heaven and I think<br/>
it likely her spirit has visited you before this time</p>

<p>It is hard living without her and she<br/>
used to call her ""poor pa, pa; and putty Papa many<br/>
times in a day. She left a kiss for her Papa with<br/>
me just before she died.</p>

<p>She eat her dinner just as well<br/>
as usual on Thursday was taken ill about 4 o'clock<br/>
with prestness for breath. The Elders laid hands upon<br/>
her and anointed her a number of times; but the<br/>
next day her spirit took its flight from this to another<br/>
world without a groan</p>

<p>To-day little Willford and I with quite <br/>
a number of friends accompanying us came over to<br/>
Commerce to pay our last respects to our little darling<br/>
in seeing he decently burried. She had no relatives<br/>
to follow her to the grave or to shed a tear for<br/>
her but her Ma and little Willford******</p>

<p>I have just been to take a pleasing<br/>
melancholy walk to Sarah's grave. She lies alone in<br/>
peace. I can say ""The Lord gave and the Lord<br/>
hath taken away and blessed be the name of the<br/>
Lord. ****** [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]].</p>

<p>On the 20th I finished a long<br/>
communication to the Editors of the Times and Seasons<br/>
signed [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] W. Woodruff and [[George Albert Smith|George A.<br/>
Smith]]. It was commenced on the 12th. I copied it off<br/>
and it filled 4 sheets. We wrote several others to [[Alfred Cordon|A<br/>
Cordon]] &amp;c and next day heard from [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>
and received also a letter from [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] with the<br/>
present of one pound. On the 30th I wrote a long<br/>
letter to my wife and we were often receiving and writing<br/>
communications to our brethren of the Twelve and<br/>
the Elders Saints relatives and friends both in [[England|England]]<br/>
and America It may well be imagined that<br/>
the numerous letters which we received and wrote from<br/>
time were not only interesting but often important to<br/>
us and the Church and that they were as much a branch</p>",

42828.0,364,,"<p>some important events in the Church. The Lord had<br/>
manifested through the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] that it was his<br/>
will that the First Presidency the Twelve the High Council<br/>
the quorum of High Priests and the Elders quorum<br/>
should as a general thing go into the vineyard</p>

<p>The instructions were for the Elders<br/>
to confine themselves to the free States and mostly<br/>
to [[New England, United States|New England]] and the [[Canada, British North America|Canadas]] and not to go<br/>
into any of the Indian or Slave States</p>

<p>There had been a special Conference <br/>
called in consequence and about four hundred Elders<br/>
had gone into the Vineyard and many others were<br/>
going. Since the foundation of the Church there had<br/>
never been such a turn out into the ministry before<br/>
as now</p>

<p>Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] and myself were<br/>
the only ones of the Twelve left and we were sick<br/>
and could not go into the vineyard: moreover it<br/>
was thought wisdom for us to continue in the<br/>
printing buisness.</p>

<p>The Prophet had of late been much<br/>
persecuted by being hunted by Sherifs and officers<br/>
from [[Missouri|Missouri]] and [[Illinois|Illinois]] by the orders of Governors<br/>
[[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Carlin|Carlin]] under pretense of taking him<br/>
to Missouri to try him upon their false charge of<br/>
his being accessary to the shooting of Ex-Governor<br/>
[[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]. This was nothing but pretence and a trap<br/>
to take the Prophet upon a charge which caught the<br/>
spirit of persecution in our enemies and not because there<br/>
was any evidence in the case.</p>

<p>But though the Prophet Joseph had<br/>
been of late like [[John (NT)|John]] on the Isle of Patmos he<br/>
had presented the Church with some glorious principles and<br/>
had occassionally appeared in the midst of the Saints<br/>
but I was deprived of the privilege of being present as<br/>
I was confined with sickness</p>

<p>September the 19th I commenced<br/>
work for the first time for forty days and cut one</p>",
42828.0,271,,"<p>of our ministerial labours as preaching or baptizing. but I <br/>
cannot alwa<strike>s</strike>ys note the detail of our communications nor would<br/>
the bare mention give the value of the correspondence of the<br/>
Twelve one to the other and to the Elders labouring under their<br/>
direction and their communications to the representative men of<br/>
the Church in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. Much more than can appear to<br/>
the reader who will be told in my synopsis of the year that<br/>
in 1840 I wrote 200 letters and received 112 and much more<br/>
than would appear if told the amount of correspondence of the<br/>
rest of the Twelve and Elders in the ministry labouring with<br/>
us much of our letter writing to each other in counselling <br/>
directing assisting and building each other up belong to the<br/>
history of the rise and progress of the British Mission.<br/>
Therefore in my journal I always noted my correspondence<br/>
as a branch of my ministerial history</p>

<p>The dark season of the year November opened<br/>
upon us and the prospect of our mission in the city of<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] was in keeping therewith. There is so much going <br/>
on in this great modern [[Babylon|Babylon]] to draw the attention of<br/>
the people that it seemed almost to require the trumpets<br/>
blast from heaven to awaken the attention of the inhabitants<br/>
to our proclamation of the restoration of the fulness of<br/>
the Gospel</p>

<p>We were here like the Apostles of<br/>
old without purse or scrip to warn the city of London.<br/>
where we had to pay high for everything we required, and<br/>
to pay <strike>ourselves</strike> for a place to preach in. We were at<br/>
this time about out of money, but still we felt to trust<br/>
in God</p>

<p><strike>November the 14 was</strike> Sunday ^Nov 1st^ <strike>and</strike> I<br/>
preached in the afternoon in the Academy to about<br/>
thirty and in the evening to about 50. We broke bread<br/>
unto the Saints and this evening there seemed to be some<br/>
interest manifested in inquiring into the work.</p>

<p>I received a letter from my mother-in-law<br/>
containing the news of the death of my uncle [[Joseph Hart, b. 1787|Joseph Hart]]<br/>
and wrote to my father in reply</p>",

the next two days I spent in drawing wood to my door.</p>

<p>I was forced to these exertions as it were<br/>
on the first moment of my recovery for I had been sick so long<br/>
that we had consumed our food and fuel</p>

<p>Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] returned home<br/>
for a few days to some printing and they were going out<br/>
again to hold conferences throughout the State. I had an<br/>
interview with them and learned that they had met in Council<br/>
with brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] who thought it widom for Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]]<br/>
and myself to continue at home and attend to the printing.</p>

<p>There was at this time a prospect of<br/>
the town of [[Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Keokurk]] coming into the hands of the<br/>
Saints and Joseph's counsel was for me to go there<br/>
in that case and publish a political paper and Elder<br/>
Taylor to publish the Times and Seasons in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]].<br/>
So I managed the affairs of my family to be ready to <br/>
do as the Lord should direct however in the sequel I did<br/>
not go to Keokurk. In addition to my own sickness<br/>
Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] had a species of fellen on both her<br/>
thumbs which had caused her much pain for two or<br/>
three weeks and my little daughter had been quite ill<br/>
about the same length of time and dangerously ill <br/>
for several days.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly the next Sunday Joseph<br/>
appeared in our midst and spoke to the Saints much<br/>
to their edification and comfort</p>

<p>Three Sundays later I preached<br/>
to the congregation and warned the Saints <strike>against taking</strike> ^not to take^<br/>
a course against the interest of the Church but to <br/>
take one which would help Joseph in his exile.</p>

<p>Some time after this we had a fire<br/>
in the upper part of the printing office. A minutes<br/>
delay and we should not have saved the building</p>

<p>On the 30th of October for the first<br/>
time the Saints held meeting in the Temple of the<br/>
Lord in Nauvoo. A temporary floor was laid<br/>
within the unfinished walls and seats prepared for</p>",

again visited the Museum. I having formed an acompanitance<br/>
with the keeper of the Egyptan antiquities and it being<br/>
a private day he accompanied us through the various<br/>
appartments and spent several hours in explaining<br/>
the most important items of history of the collection<br/>
of Egyptian Jewish Greek and Roman antiquities</p>

<p>I had a specimen of [[Guy Fawkes|Guy <br/>
Fawke's]] day in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] on the 5th but the crowd<br/>
of boys with their historical effigy was not so interesting<br/>
to me as the letters which the postman brought. One<br/>
was from [[Samuel Jones, b. 1823|Samuel Jones]] containing good news and a<br/>
pound to assist me. The others were from my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]<br/>
and Elder [[William Oglesby Clark|Wm Clark]] who informed me that Phebe and<br/>
my little son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] was at his [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father's]] house. He<br/>
said they shall not want anything which I can bestow<br/>
and may God hold it as an everlasting covenant<br/>
between thee and me. He further informed me that<br/>
the temporal affairs of the church at Headquarters was<br/>
never in a more prosperous state and that a number<br/>
of families had arrived from [[England|England]] and my wife<br/>
had an interview with Bro [[William Benbow|Benbow]]. There was no<br/>
moving against the Saints but they were gathering rapidly<br/>
to the body of the Church in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Next Sunday we preached and broke<br/>

meetings and on the 9th received letters Elders<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]] [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]], [[Theadore Curtis|Curtis]] [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] and [[S. Johnson|Johnson]]<br/>
Elders Kimball and Pratt both informed us of the<br/>
death of Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] who was the first<br/>
Patriarch of the Church of Latter-Day Saints and the<br/>
father of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]].</p>

<p>Elder Kington spoke of the letter which<br/>
he or the Saints sent me containing £2 which was<br/>
lost. I went to the general Post Office and ^it^ and the<br/>
Post Master said he would trace it out. I mention these<br/>
letters with gifts of money sometimes for they explain<br/>
from whence came the means which first supported the</p>",
42828.0,318,,"<p>After the meeting was dismissed I was about <br/>
three hours shaking hands with the Saints healing the <br/>
sick and giving counsel to the multitude who surrounded <br/>
me many of whom were in tears as we parted. Nearly <br/>
fifty came to me to ask me to take them to Zion <br/>
when I had not means to take myself. I however gave <br/>
Sister [[Mary Jenkins Foxall|Foxal]] five pounds to make up enough to help <br/>
her and her [[James Foxall|husband]] and children to the land of <br/>
America. She had raised 30 pounds by using <br/>
every exertion for six months to gather with the <br/>
Saints and the five pounds which I gave her was a <br/>
donation of Elder [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey]] who was imparting <br/>
of his substance to help the poor of the Church <br/>
to gather.</p>

<p>After biding the multitude of Saints <br/>
farewell I went to Elder O<strike>a</strike>ckey's to spend the night <br/>
accompanied by Elders [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] and [[William Kay|Kay]]</p>

<p>We had been in the house but a <br/>
short time when ^3 of^ Edward Ockey's brothers came<br/>
in for the purpose of having a contest because <br/>
their brother and sister had embraced the gospel <br/>
and was about to gather with the Saints. They <br/>
manifested much wrath against me and after <br/>
conversing with them about 3 hours they left the <br/>
house and we were once more in peace</p>

<p>After conversing together until <br/>
the third watch of the night we retired to rest <br/>
closing one of the busiest days of my life.</p>

<p>I arose in the morning refreshed <br/>
by sleep and after <strike>conversing</strike> several hours with Elders <br/>
Richards Kington Kay Ockey and others of the Saints<br/>
I was under the necessity of parting with the Saints <br/>
in this region.</p>

<p>In biding them farewell I found <br/>
in our hearts and memory of our association many <br/>
ties which bound me to those I were leaving behind<br/>
and among the faithful ones were the Ockeys.<br/>
Brother Edward Ockey and his sister [[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann]] were of</p>",
42828.0,366,,"<p>three thousand persons. The room was crowded and<br/>
the walls lined with people. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] had returned<br/>
to the city and was expected to preach but ill-health<br/>
and other causes prevented him.</p>

<p>On the same day [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]<br/>
returned from the east with his family and the<br/>
next day came to my house and was taken with<br/>
the Cholera Morbeus and was low for several days.</p>

<p>My son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] was taken down<br/>
with the croup and for a time was dangerous.</p>

<p>The Twelve returned home on<br/>
the 4th of November.</p>

<p>Joseph wished Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John <br/>
Taylor]] and myself to take the responsibility of<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Printing Office, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Printing Office]] and liberate him from it<br/>
He offered to rent the property to us for simple interest<br/>
and we concluded to take it.</p>

<p>The City Council spent several<br/>
days in session passing a law relative to Writ of<br/>
Habus Corpus and after it was passed Joseph<br/>
felt secure to stay at home as it protected him<br/>
as well as other citizens.</p>

<p>On the 7th of the following month<br/>
(December) Elder Orson Hyde returned to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
having in his mission been in [[England|England]] [[Germany|Germany]]<br/>
[[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and other parts of [[Asia|Asia]].</p>

<p>In England Elder Hyde was with<br/>
the Twelve when they in the capacity of a quorum<br/>
fully organized the British Mission; in Germany he<br/>
preached and published the Gospel in the German<br/>
language and circulated the tracts among the various<br/>
nations and in Jerusalem he visited Mount Olivet<br/>
He was the first Elder of the Latter-day Church<br/>
<strike>w</strike>that ever visited Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The following Sunday Elder<br/>
Orson Hyde at President Joseph Smiths delivered<br/>
an interesting <strike>an</strike> account of his travels at Jerusalem<br/>
and home again. He spoke of the Mount Olivit</p>",
42828.0,273,,"<p>work in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. I wrote to Elders [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] and [[Daniel Browett|Browett]]<br/>
of my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] field and a very lengthy one to my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife's]]<br/>
[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father]] and [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|mother]] giving an account of this country.</p>

<p>This was the [[Thomas Johnson|Lord Mayor's]] day when<br/>
the chief Magestrate of the chief city of the world takes the oath<br/>
of office. It is a great day in London. I saw the<br/>
gorgeous procession pass.</p>

<p><strike>This day</strike> Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]] informed<br/>
me that it was the counsel of the Twelve <strike>for him</strike> ^[[George Albert Smith|G A Smith]]^ to go<br/>
immediately to the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] and spend some time with<br/>
the churches there as there was only about work enough<br/>
for one in London and so early next morning we <br/>
started for [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] and I was left again alone</p>

<p>The next few days I felt lonely<br/>
without my companion brother Smith for although London<br/>
is not a wilderness a Latter-day Saints Travelling Elder<br/>
at that date would be almost as solitary there.</p>

<p>At night on the 12th while I was<br/>
preaching Brother [[William Hill Pitt|Wm Pitt]] from [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] entered the<br/>
room I was surprised to see him for I was not<br/>
looking for any ^one^. He became a companion in the<br/>
ministry for me during the next five days</p>

<p>On the 16th I received a letter from<br/>
Elder [[Thomas Henry Clark|Thomas Clark]] containing a gift of £1 and<br/>
one from Elder [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] informing me of the progress<br/>
of the work in Herefordshire and surrounding<br/>
country. I wrote to them and Elder Kington<br/>
and held several hours conversation with a<br/>
follower of [[Joanna Southcott|Joanna Southcott]] and several days<br/>
after had a long interview with five of her<br/>
followers. In the meantime Elder Pitt had<br/>
left me and took a mission to [[Ipswich, Suffolk, England|Ipswich]]. and<br/>
I had preached several times and as usual receiving<br/>
and writing letters daily.</p>

<p>On the 19th I preached at the<br/>
Academy. Brother [[William Hulme|Hulme]] a captain of one of<br/>
the Pickford's Boats on the London canal was<br/>
present with two of his hands whom he had baptized.</p>",
42828.0,319,,"<p>a good and wealthy family. <strike>and</strike> They had many trials to <br/>
pass through to do the will of God <strike>and maintain their <br/>
faith and integrity</strike>  and to gather with the Saints for their <br/>
brothers were exceedingly set against them. But brother <br/>
[[Edward Ockey|Edward]] had maintained his integrity like a man of God <br/>
and was making every preparation to gather with the Saints <br/>
but his sister [[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann]] had fears that her brothers would <br/>
hinder her gathering.</p>

<p>Having bid farewell to the Saints of <br/>
[[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standly Hill]] I walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frooms Hill]] and conversed with <br/>
the Elders untl 2 o'clock when I took the parting hands <br/>
of Elders [[Levi Richards|Richards]] [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] [[William Kay|Kay]] and others and with my <br/>
carpet-bag with about 20 lbs weight in it walked 15 miles <br/>
to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] in four hours</p>

<p>When I arrived there I was so very <br/>
lame and weary with my heavy load and fast walking that <br/>
I could scarcely walk at all. I then took the rail and <br/>
arrived in [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] at 10 o'clock at night but was <br/>
exceedingly lame and weary. I spent the night with <br/>
Elder [[James Riley|James Riley]] 24 Park Street.</p>

<p>I had now fairly ended my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]<br/>
mission and bidden a last farewell to that field of labour <br/>
where the Lord had blessed me beyond all my expectations</p>

<p>I now left three conferences in the region <br/>
which I opened one year before on the 5th of the same month <br/>
that I left this vineyard planted all over with Churches<br/>
numbering fifteen hundred Saints. <strike>I have given <br/>
the minutes of those Conference not to load my book <br/>
with dry statestics which is never interesting to the <br/>
reader but to lay at once before the view if I may <br/>
so express it diagrams of the rise and progress of the <br/>
work number of Churches planted and conferences organized <br/>
in that region.</strike> <strike>If the readers will thus consider these</strike><br/>
^The^ minutes which I have recorded <strike>they</strike> will <strike>see in them</strike> <br/>

of the Churches in Herefordshire and the regions around.<br/>

him of the days of Christ</p>

<p>The year had rolled around and ended<br/>
with me in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] attending principally to the duties of<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Printing Office, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Printing Office]] and I was tankful to the Lord for his<br/>
mercies which had brought me through the events and<br/>
scenes of 1842 and prolonged my life which Death had<br/>
threatened for future labour in His cause.</p>

born on the 21st and all [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] rang with jubilant<br/>
bells.</p>

forepart of which was spent in reading and conversing<br/>
with Father [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]] and his family and in the<br/>
^In the^ afternoon and ^22nd^ evening ^of Sunday 22^ we held public meeting<br/>
when four offered themselves for baptism but it<br/>
had been with hard labouring and much expence<br/>
that we had obtained this little success in the<br/>
establishment of the work in London.</p>

<p>I commenced this day a long<br/>
epistle to my wife in which I sent her about<br/>
thirty extracts from letters for her to present<br/>
to the Editors of the Times and Seasons for them<br/>
to publish as they thought fit.</p>

<p>The Sunday following I<br/>
again preached twice and baptized and confirmed<br/>
three. These were</p>

Next day I took a very interesting walk with Dr<br/>
[[William Copeland|Wm. Copeland]] through every part of the college of<br/>
surigeons at Lincoln's Inn Fields and on my return <br/>
home I was soon joined by Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] who had come to spend a week <br/>
or two in London. This was the first time<br/>
ever President Brigham Young was in the metropolis<br/>

The day after my arrival in [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]<br/>
I visited the Brass Foundry and then travelled to [[West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England|West<br/>
Bromwich]] and on the morrow took coach to [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] and <br/>
had an interview with Elder [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]] and wrote <br/>
to Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]]

<p>We met a large congregation of the <br/>
Saints in the Hanley meeting Room when Elder George <br/>
A. Smith and myself preached. I was happy to learn <br/>
that the work of the Lord was rapidly prospering in <br/>
the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]]</p>

<p>I received and read the 11 No of the <br/>
Millennial Star. It contained an interesting letter <br/>
from President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] to the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve.</p>

the history of our people. Joseph had been presecuted<br/>

of illegal proceedings false oaths edicts of governors and<br/>
pursuit from Sheriffs.</p>

<p>Visit to the [[Tower of London, London, Middlesex, England|Tower of London]]</p>

<p>In company of Brothers [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
C Kimball]] on the 3rd of December I visited the Tower<br/>
of London without seeing which the traveller would lose a <br/>
capital page from the history of his travels in England.</p>

<p>As usual I called at the time and entered in my<br/>
Journal a synopsis of  its history &amp;c</p>

<p>The Tower is situated on the east side<br/>
of the city about 800 yards from London Bridge and near<br/>
the bank of the [[River Thames, England|Thames]]. At first it consisted of<br/>
no more than what at present is called the White Tower<br/>
It has been said though without sufficient authority that<br/>
[[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar]] built it but there is the strongest of evidence<br/>
that [[William the Conqueror of England|William the Conquerer]] was its first designer and<br/>
builder. It has three batteries — The Devils Battery<br/>
the Stone Battery and the Wooden Battery all mounted<br/>
with cannon.</p>

<p>The Tower was a palace during five<br/>
hundred years but ceased to be so in the time of<br/>
[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and here some of the darkest tragedies of<br/>
of [[England|England's]] monarchs were enacted and immortalized<br/>
by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespear's]] Pen. The principal buildings are<br/>
the Church the White Tower Govenor's House The Bloody<br/>
Tower the offices of Ordinance of the Keepers of the<br/>
Record the Jewel Office the Horde Armoury Queen<br/>
Elizabeth's armoury the grand Store House in which<br/>
is the small armoury the train of Artillery and<br/>
the Tent Room the new Store House houses for<br/>
the chief and inferior officers mess house for the<br/>
officers and barracks for the soldiers. In addition<br/>
to these there is a street called the Mint which<br/>
includes one third part of the Tower</p>

<p>The Grand Storehouse is north of the<br/>
White Tower. It extends in length 345 feet</p>",
42828.0,321,,"<p>of silk for my wife as cheep as could be bought in [[England|England]]</p>

<p>Thence to [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]] with several of the <br/>
brethren and sat in Council with a number of the officers <br/>
Among other business was the case of a brother [[William Momford|Mumford]] who <br/>
was practising the black art fortune telling &amp;c but as he <br/>
persisted in his course the Council withdrew fellowship from <br/>
him. One thing is worthy of notice that while the <br/>
Priesthood was upon him he could not set his magic glasses<br/>
as before but did after the office of Priest was taken from <br/>
him</p>

<p>I spent the night at Brother [[William Box|^William^ Box]] who had been <br/>
sorely tempted and afflicted of the Devil for many days <br/>
We laid our hands upon him and cast the devil out and <br/>
he had peace.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 20th of March the</p>

<p>[[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]] Conference</p>

<p>of the Church of Latter-day Saints met and there <br/>
were present of the Twelve [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and Willford<br/>
Woodruff with one High Priest 13 Elders 28 Priests 10 Teachers <br/>
and eight Deacons. The Conference was held in the <br/>
Majestrates Assembly Room.</p>

<p>At the close of the Conference it was voted <br/>
that ""This Conference grants unto Elders Woodruff and <br/>
George A. Smith a letter of recommendation manifesting <br/>
that the Church in this region accept of their labours <br/>
and consider that they have filled their mission with <br/>
honour and dignity""</p>

<p>We had a very interesting time<br/>
on this occasssion. The conference was held in a place <br/>
which would hold 800 and it was crowded; but there<br/>
was perfect order and much good feeling manifested<br/>
during the day. There was <strike>a good</strike> prospect of a continued <br/>
increase in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]]</p>

<p>George A. Smith was the President <br/>
of the Conference and [[Thomas Joseph Filcher|T. J. Fitcher]] and [[Osmond Shaw|O Shaw]] clerks</p>

<p>Next day George A Smith and myself <br/>
met the officers in Council at the Hanley ^Meeting^ Room and gave</p>",
42828.0,369,,"<p>Too well our history had told us how [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his brethren<br/>
had been incarcerated in prison where they had laid in <strike>some<br/>
cases the year round</strike> inhumanly treated and their lives in<br/>
constant jeopardy and all in contempt of law and without<br/>
trial. This was the reason why Joseph wished not to<br/>
be delivered up to the tender mercy of [[Missouri|Missouri]].</p>

<p>But the election of a new Governor had<br/>
given the Prophet a chance of a trial and he returned and<br/>
demanded one and delivered himself to the authorities of<br/>
the State of [[Illinois|Illionois]].</p>

<p>The demanded trial was granted<br/>
him before the Supreme Court of the United States and<br/>
he had been honourably acquitted according to the law<br/>
of the <strike>law of </strike> ^land^ as he well knew he would be if granted<br/>
a legal trial and not committed to the lawless power<br/>
of those in authority who sought his liberty and his<br/>
life.</p>

<p>Joseph had now returned to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
to have a Jubilee with the Church</p>

<p>The seventeenth of January was<br/>
appointed by General Proclamation for humiliation<br/>
fasting prayer and thanksgiving for the release<br/>
and delivery which we had received.</p>

<p>Meetings were appointed throughout<br/>
the city. I met at President Joseph Smiths where<br/>
we had a very interesting time.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph spoke for some<br/>
length on the Kingdom of God and the baptism of<br/>
[[John (NT)|John]] and other subjects of interest the substance of<br/>
which was aftwards delivered by the Prophet in the<br/>
Temple and which I shall presently give.</p>

<p>At our meeting on this General<br/>
Thanksgiving day besides the address of the Prophet<br/>
many prayers and exhortations were made. I spoke twice<br/>
and felt much of the Spirit <strike>of</strike> <strike>the</strike> present.</p>

<p>The next day Joseph and his<br/>
[[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|lady]] made a feast for his friends to keep the<br/>
day as a time of rejoicing for his deliverance</p>",

<p>The quorum voted that they accepted <br/>
the labours of said Committee</p>

<p>Resolved that as the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve have had nothing to do with the printing of the <br/>
Book of Mormon they will not now interfere with it <br/>
but that the said Committee settle the financial or <br/>
business matters thereof with Joseph Smith Jun<sup>r</sup><br/>
to whom the profits rightly belong.</p>

<p>Resolved that Elder [[Amos Fielding|Amos Fielding]] be <br/>
appointed to superintend fitting-out the Saints from <br/>
[[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] to America under the instruction of Elder <br/>
Parley P. Pratt</p>

Twelve and the twenty who went with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|him]] to [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]]<br/>

<p>The following day was one of much<br/>
satisfaction in consequence of [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt's]] return to<br/>
the quorum of the Twelve</p>

<p>We met at [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]]<br/>
and the First Presidency and the Twelve conversed<br/>
over the subject. Orson had humbled himself<br/>
for opposing Joseph and the brethren of his own<br/>
quorum and desired very much to return to his<br/>
former place.</p>

<p>After our counselling together we<br/>
assembled at the [[Mississippi River, United States|River]] and Joseph went down into<br/>
the water and baptized Orson and his [[Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt|wife]] and<br/>
Widow [[Lydia Dibble Granger|Granger]]. The Prophet then confirmed<br/>
them and ordained Orson to the Apostleship and<br/>
his former standing amongst us. This caused<br/>
our hearts to rejoice.</p>

<p>Elder [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] who<br/>
had been appointed in his stead as a member of<br/>
the quorum of the Twelve was taken into the First<br/>
Presidency which left the place again vacant for<br/>

When ever there has been a righteous man unto whom the<br/>
Lord has revealed his word and given power and authority<br/>
to administer in his name then has the Kingdom of<br/>
God been set up and where there is a Priest of the Most<br/>
High—a minister who has power and authority from<br/>
Him to administer in the ordinances of the Gospel<br/>
and officiate in the Priesthood there is the Kingdom<br/>
of God.</p>

<p>In consequence of rejecting the Gospel<br/>
of Jesus Christ and the Prophets whom God hath<br/>
sent His judgements hath rested upon people cities<br/>
and nations in various ages of the world. This was<br/>
the case with the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah which<br/>
were destroyed for rejecting the Prophets</p>

<p>Now I will give my testimony. I<br/>
care not for man. I speak boldly and faithfully<br/>
and with authority.</p>

<p>How is it with the Kingdom<br/>
of God? Where did the Kingdom of God begin?<br/>
What constitutes the Kingdom of God?</p>

<p>I answer where there is no Kingdom<br/>
of God there is no salvation. Where there is a Prophet <br/>
or a Priest or a righteous man unto whom the Lord gives<br/>
his oracles there is the kingdom of where the oracles<br/>
are not there the Kingdom of God is not.</p>

<p>In these remarks I have no allusion<br/>
to the Kingdoms of the earth. We will keep the laws of<br/>
the land. We do not speak against them nor ever have<br/>
but we can scarcely make mention of the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
and our persecutions but the cry goes forth that we<br/>
are guilty of treason &amp;c.</p>

<p>We speak of the Kingdom of God<br/>
on the earth and not the kingdoms of men.</p>

<p>The plea of many is that we have<br/>
no right to receive revelations; but if we do not receive<br/>
revelation we do not have the oracles of God and they<br/>
who have not the oracles of God are not His people</p>",

specimen of pistols carbines &amp;c of the times of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] &amp;<br/>
[[James I of England|James I]] &amp; [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[William III of England|William III]] to which considerable<br/>

with Gilt furniture and th<strike>e</strike>ree swords and a helmet<br/>
and girdle ^which^ belonged to [[Tipu Sultan|Tippo Saib]]</p>

<p>We next entered the long room where<br/>
we saw various figures wearing the armour of the various<br/>
periods in which they lived Kings soldiers &amp;c. One<br/>
was for a man seven feet high. At the extremity of<br/>
the room is a crusader upon his barbed horse said<br/>
to be 700 years old. Here we also saw great variety<br/>
of curious things. Passing into</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth's Armoury</p>

<p>we found weapons of war of every variety and most of<br/>
them in use before fire arms were invented. This<br/>
room according to tradition was the prison of the<br/>
celebrated Sir [[Walter Raleigh|Walter Raleigh]]. At the end of the room<br/>
is a sprightly figure of Queen Elizabeth upon a<br/>
cream coloured horse &amp; held by a page. Her dress<br/>
is in imitation of that worn by her in her procession<br/>
to St. Paul's to return thanks for the deliverance of<br/>
[[England|England]] from the threatened Spanish invasion. In<br/>
this room also there was a variety of instruments of<br/>
torture</p>

that he should have a son and Zechariah was<br/>
a descendant of Aaron. [##Luke 1:13##] And the Lord had<br/>

writing to his wife I accompanied President Young on<br/>
his visit to [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]] and [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]]<br/>
and on the next day I went out with him to find the<br/>
Book of Mormon which we heard was published and<br/>
for sale by some person unknown. The report was<br/>
untrue</p>

<p>Sunday was an interesting day <br/>
to us Elder Young Kimball and Priest [[Robert Williams|Williams]]<br/>
attended meeting at St Pauls in the morning and<br/>
I met with the Saints at Father [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corners]] and read<br/>
and conversed with them and in the afternoon met<br/>
at the [[Barrett|Academy]] and had about 50 present Brother Kimball<br/>
preached to them.</p>

<p>An Independent Minister invited<br/>
me home to take ten with him. I accepted his<br/>
invitation had an interesting time and preached the<br/>
Gospel to him and he received my testimony and offered<br/>
me his chapel which would hold 800. He said he<br/>
thought he should be baptized and would try and<br/>
get his society to do the same.</p>

<p>We met again in the evening<br/>
and had more at our meeting than ever before. Brother<br/>
Brigham Young preached and was followed by brothers<br/>
Kimball Williams Corner [[William Hulme|Hulme]] and myself.</p>

<p>We had a very interesting time<br/>
and one offered himself for baptism. There were some<br/>
of the Aikenites present one of whom purchased a<br/>
Hymn Book. They wished us to call upon them<br/>
and thought they would be baptized. We then met<br/>
at Father Corner's and communed with the Saints and<br/>
had a good time.</p>",
42828.0,326,,"<p>The Conference reassembled pursuant to adjournment <br/>
and opened by prayer.</p>

<p>The scattered members were represented <br/>
consisting of nearly 50 members not included in the foregoing</p>

<p>The [[Brigham Young|President]] then made some remarks <br/>
on the office of Patriarch and concluded by moving that <br/>
Elder [[John Albiston Sr.|John Albertson]] be ordained to that office. This <br/>
was seconded by Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and carried unanimously</p>

<p>Resolved that <br/>
[[George Darling Watt|G. D. Watt]] [[George Washington Joshua Adams|G. J. Adams]] [[Amos Fielding|Amos Fielding]] [[William Kay|William<br/>
Kay]] [[John Sanders|John Sanders]] [[James Riley|J. Riley]] [[Thomas Richardson|Thomas Richardson]]<br/>
[[James Whitehead|James Whitehead]] [[Thomas Dunville|Thomas Dunville]] [[James Galley|James Galley]] <br/>
&amp; [[George Simpson|George Simpson]] be ordained High Priests.</p>

<p>Resolved that the following persons be <br/>
ordained Elders:</p>

<p>[[William Miller|William Miller]] [[William Leach|William Leach]], [[John Sands|John <br/>
Sandy]] [[William Moon|William Moon]] [[William Hardman|William Hardman]], [[William Young Black|Wm <br/>
Black]] [[John Goodfellow|John Goodfellow]] [[Joseph Brotherton|Joseph Brotherton]], [[Richard Benson|Richard <br/>
Benson]] [[Theophilus Brotherton|Theophilus Brotherton]] [[John McIlwrick|John Mc Ilwrick]]<br/>
and [[William Green|William Green]].</p>

<p>The Council of the Twelve then <br/>
proceeded to organize all the Churches into Conferences <br/>
throughout the Kingdom of [[Great Britain|Great Britain]], and <br/>
appoint presiding Elders over them.</p>

<p>The Conference then adjourned till 7 o'clock<br/>
when it re-assembled and opened by singing and prayer</p>

<p>The Patriarch [[Peter Melling|Peter Mellen]] was then <br/>
called upon to pronounce<strike>e</strike> the Patriarchal blessing <strike>and</strike> ^who^ <br/>
the head of John Albertson previous to his being <br/>
ordained to the office of Patriarch. He then laid <br/>
his hands upon him and blessed him</p>

<p>The Twelve afterwards laid their <br/>
hands upon him and ordained him to the office <br/>
of Patriarch.</p>

<p>The High Priests and Elders were <br/>
then ordained and much counsel was given by the <br/>
President and others of the Twelve</p>

forth preaching repentance and baptism for the remission<br/>
of sins but at the same time crying 'There cometh<br/>
one after me mightier than I the Latchet of whose<br/>
shoes I am not worthy to unloose.</p>

<p>And Christ came according to the<br/>
word of [[John (NT)|John]]. He was greater than John because<br/>
he held the keys of the Melchisidic Priesthood<br/>
and Kingdom of God and had before revealed<br/>
the Priesthood to [[Moses (OT)|Moses]]; and Jesus in his<br/>
teachings says upon this rock I will build my church<br/>
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<br/>
What Rock? Revelation!</p>

<p>Yet Christ was baptized by John<br/>
to fulfill all righteousness. ""Again He says except<br/>
ye are born of water and the Spirit ye cannot<br/>
enter the Kingdom of Heaven""; and though the<br/>
heavens and the earth pass away my word shall<br/>
not pass away""</p>

<p>If a man be born of the water<br/>
and the Spirit he can enter into the Kingdom of<br/>
God.</p>

<p>It is evident that the Kingdom of<br/>
God was upon the earth and John prepared subjects<br/>
for that kingdom by preaching the Gospel to them<br/>
and baptizing them. He prepared the way<br/>
before the Saviour or came as a forerunner and<br/>
prepared for the preaching of Christ.</p>

<p>Christ preached through [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]<br/>
on the same ground where John had preached and<br/>
when the Apostles were raised up they ^all^ worked in<br/>
Jerusalem and Jesus commanded them to tarry there<br/>
until they were endowed with power from on high.</p>

<p>Had they not work to do in<br/>
Jerusalem? They did work and prepared people<br/>
for the Pentecost; but the Kingdom of God was<br/>
with them before the day of Pentecost as well as<br/>
afterwards.</p>",
42828.0,281,,"<p>I rejoiced at the prospect which was opening before<br/>
us for we had laboured a long time and the work had<br/>
gone slow but now a wide opening was being made to<br/>
roll on the work of the Lord in the Metroplis of [[England|England]]</p>

<p>But, though slow the work in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]<br/>
in its early history, and with us in calling the people into<br/>
the Kingdom of God like as with the servants of the<br/>
King in the parable, whose invitation to the Marriage<br/>
Feast was met every man with his excuse yet the Lord<br/>
had been with us, and the prophetic spirit was abundant<br/>
with testimonies of our mission. Doubtless this prophetic<br/>
view of the future made our missionary labours in<br/>
the great Babylon of modern times less wearisome<br/>
than it otherwise would have been. The Spirit all<br/>
along bore testimony to us that there would be a great<br/>
work done in London and Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] prophesied<br/>
that there would the greatest numbers and the largest<br/>
conference. This has since been abundantly fulfilled<br/>
for London has become the metropolis of the foreign<br/>
missions of the Church.</p>

<p>On the seventh of the month we<br/>
all acomplanied Dr. [[Samuel Copeland|Copeland]] to the college of Surgeons<br/>
and next visited the National Gallery and other<br/>
parts of the city and then returned and took tea after<br/>
which Elder Kimball baptized one at the Bath<br/>
in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Taberancle Square]]. Brothers Young [[Robert Williams|Williams]]<br/>
and myself walked into another part of the town<br/>
and had a view of ""Life in London"".</p>

<p>A Visit to the Stables of the Queen</p>

<p>It was a rainy day in London but we<br/>
had all concluded to visit [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St. James' Park]] [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham<br/>
Palace]] and the Queens stables. Brothers Young<br/>
and Williams went on before us to see the <br/>
Queen's Horse Guards but it came on the rain and<br/>
they returned home thinking we should not come<br/>
so we did not see them during the whole of the</p>",

to the meeting which was blessed by them and distributed <br/>
to all the officers and members and the whole congregation <br/>
amounting to about seven hundred. A large fragment <br/>
was left for some who were not present</p>

<p>While the cake was passing [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>
composed the following lines</p>

When sinking in sorrow <br/>
Fresh courage we'll take <br/>
As we think on our friends<br/>
And remember the cake</p>

<p>Elder [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] appealed powerfully to the meeting <br/>
and covenanted with the Saints present in a bond <br/>
of mutual prayer during his mission to [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] <br/>
and the East which was sustained on the part of <br/>
the congregation by a hearty Amen.</p>

<p>Elder [[Joseph Fielding|Joseph Fielding]] made some remarks<br/>
and spoke of the rich cake and considered it a type <br/>
of the good things of that land land from whence it came <br/>
and from whence they had received the fulness of the <br/>
Gospel.</p>

<p>A Capital Note of Church History</p>

<p>It is most worthy of note in the history of the <br/>
Latter-Day Church that this was not only the </p>",
42828.0,375,,"<p>It was also with [[John (NT)|John]] and he preached<br/>
the same Gospel and baptism that Jesus and the Apostles<br/>
preached after him.</p>

<p>The endowment of Pentecost was to<br/>
prepare the disciples for their mission into the world</p>

<p>""Whenever a man can find out the<br/>
will of God and find an administrator legally authorized<br/>
from Him there is the Kingdom of God; but where<br/>
these are not the Kingdom of God is not. All<br/>
the ordinances systems and administrations on the<br/>
earth are of no use to the children of men unless<br/>
they are ordained and authorized of God for nothing<br/>
will <strike>same</strike> ^save^ a man but a legal administrator<br/>
for none other will be acknowledged either by<br/>
God or angels.</p>

<p>I know what I say. I understand<br/>
my mission and business. God Almighty is<br/>
my shield and what can man do if God is my<br/>
friend? <u>I shall not be sacrificed until my</u><br/>
<u>time comes.</u> <u>Then</u> <u>I</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>offered</u> <u>freely</u>.</p>

<p>All flesh is as grass and the governor<br/>
is no better than other men. When he dies he<br/>
is but a bag of dung.</p>

<p>I thank God for preserving<br/>
me from my enemies. I have no enmity. I<br/>
have no desire but to do all men good. I feel<br/>
to pray for all men. We do not ask people<br/>
to throw away any good which they have we<br/>
only ask them to come and get more. What<br/>
if all the world should embrace this Gospel?<br/>
They would then see eye to eye and the<br/>
blessings of God would be poured out upon the<br/>
people which is my whole soul's desire<br/>
Amen</p>",
42828.0,282,,"<p>day. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself and two of the<br/>
Saints started walked to [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St. James Park]] and through the<br/>
whole length of it and visited the [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Palace]] and the Queen's<br/>
Stables.</p>

<p>The first stable we entered was that<br/>
of the State Horses. They were 12 in number and<br/>
the most beautiful cream coloured Hanovarians. They<br/>
were the most kind and intelligent of anything of the<br/>
brute creation I ever saw and were about seventeen<br/>
hands high and well proportioned. We also saw twelve<br/>
Arabians and we visited all the stables containing her<br/>
Majesty's horses which were one hundred and fifty<br/>
in number</p>

<p>We next viewed the appartments<br/>
containing the harness for 150 horses. There was<br/>
the full set of state harness, for eight cream coloured<br/>
Hanavarians, made by order of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and was<br/>
covered with gold plate and the harness of each horse<br/>
weighed 150 lbs. Every set was very expensive being<br/>
covered with gold plate</p>

<p>A birds eye view of the Queens<br/>
riding ground we took as we passed along and saw<br/>
one of the Lords and others of the Household riding<br/>
out. Entering the coach houses we saw her Majestys<br/>
private coaches a number of which were very grand<br/>
and costly and lastly came our inspection of the State <br/>
Coach.</p>

<p><strike>The First</strike> Apostles of the Church <br/>
of Latter-day Saints</p>

The High Council of the Church with nine of <br/>
its members present and in General Conference <br/>
legislate for the Church in the capacity of a full <br/>
quorum. <strike>in a foreign land.</strike> Moreover of the quorum <br/>
of the Twelve Apostles of that date the 9 who at this <br/>
General Conerence transacted business as a full council <br/>
were the only ones of that quorum who stood faithful <br/>
and of those 9 [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] <br/>
have since departed to fill their calling in another <br/>
sphere. They therefore in this life can never <br/>
meet and act again as on that day.</p>

<p>Future Generation deeply interested <br/>
in the capital items of the history of this Church <br/>
will doubtless deem it worthy of marked record and of <br/>
great historical importance to find authoritative data <br/>
that the First Apostles of the Church ordained under <br/>
the presidenlcy of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] never sat as a <br/>
full council nor legislated in their quorum capacity only <br/>
in America and [[England|England]] and in this only time in <br/>
Foreign Missions Brigham Young sat at their head <br/>
and then they organized the British Mission prior <br/>
to the return of seven of their number to America and <br/>
from that British Mission has branched out the foreign <br/>
missions of the Church throughout Europe.</p>

<p>On the day after the Conference I <br/>
called at the book store of Elder Parley P. Pratt 47 <br/>
[[Oxford Street, London, Middlesex, England|Oxford Street]] and found his house full of Elders many <br/>
of whom were about parting to go to their fields of <br/>
labour.</p>

<p>The clerk of our Conference was somewhat <br/>
in trouble as he had this morning lost all the <br/>
Minutes of the General Conference and he had</p>",

to sterrotype the ""Doctrines and Covenants"" of the <br/>
Church</p>

<p>On the evening of March the 10th<br/>
I saw in the South west quarter of the heavens<br/>
a stream of light in the form of a broad sword<br/>
with the hilt downwards and the blade raised<br/>
pointing from west south west. At an angle of<br/>
45 degrees from the horison and extending within<br/>
two or three degrees to the zeneth of the degree where<br/>
the sign appeared. It was discovered at 7 o'clock<br/>
and gradually disappeared from half past seven<br/>
and at nine o'clock it was entirely gone.</p>

<p>This sign of a drawn sword<br/>
in the heavens appeared for several evenings<br/>
and on the 14th it moved up near the moon and<br/>
formed itself into a large ring around the moons<br/>
balls immediately appeared in the ring opposite<br/>
each other something in the form of sundogs<br/>
and another half ring issued from those balls<br/>
something in the shape of a horseshoe extending<br/>
outside of the first ring with one line running<br/>
through the centre of the moon</p>

<p>A week or two afterwards there were<br/>
also remarkable signs in the heavens. [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>

<p>The Twelve spent some time in council in <br/>
the forepart of the day and in the afternooon they with all the <br/>
American brethren present went to Bro [[William Miller|Millers]] and took tea<br/>
and had an interesting time together</p>

<p>Before we left the Twelve laid their <br/>
hands upon the head of [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and blessed him in the <br/>
name of the Lord as he had been set apart to go to the Holy <br/>
Land, [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] as a messenger and forerunner of the <br/>

<p>I walked into the city with Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>

a small spyglass.</p>

<p>I wrote a letter to Elder [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey]] <br/>
and also to my wife and receved 4 pounds 10 shillings from <br/>
Elder [[John Horlick|John Hollick]] by the hand of Elder [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]]</p>

<p>Good Friday Elder Kimball baptized Brother <br/>
[[Thomas Brotherton|Brotherton]] who then came to Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and <br/>
was confirmed. We dined at his house after which we <br/>
all walked to the Zool<strike>l</strike>ogical Gardins. There were fifteen <br/>
of the American brethren present. We returned and <br/>
took tea at Bro M<sup>c</sup> Kendricks</p>

<p>Next day I accompanied Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] <br/>
to the railway station and he took his departure for <br/>
[[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]].</p>

<p>On the Sunday I preached in the <br/>
Carpenters Hall in the morning and was followed <br/>
by Parley P. Pratt and in the afternoon the sacrament <br/>
was administered and amny testified of the work <br/>
In the evening Elder [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] preached from [[Daniel (OT)|Daniel]] <br/>
upon the Kingdoms Symbolized in that book and <br/>
Elders Kimball and Young followed him.</p>

Millennial Star and had 76 volumes as my share <br/>
of the property and I had sold 40 Hymn Books <br/>
to P. Pratt a few days previous</p>",

<p>There were also other signs and it was singular<br/>
that in the case of the sign of the sword that on the opposite<br/>
side of the horison there was seen a black streak about the size<br/>
and shape of the light one. The one was black as darkness<br/>
while the other had considerable the appearance of the <br/>
blaze of a comet.</p>

a splendid tea meeting of the Saints at the Music <br/>
Hall Liverpool. This Hall the Church had rented <br/>
for the Latter day Saints meeting place and it would <br/>
hold about 2000. There <strike>was</strike> ^were^ now sat down to <br/>
table at this tea meeting about 200 Saints</p>

<p>This was the first time I had <br/>
visited Liverpool since I first landed. It gave me <br/>
peculiar feelings to set down to tthe festive board with <br/>
200 Saints and to think that when we first landed <br/>
there was not a soul in that great place who belonged <br/>
to the Church but ourselves</p>

<p>After tea we were introduced to <br/>
this intelligent body of Saints and the Twelve addressed <br/>
them in a few words.</p>

<p>After the meeting our quorum <br/>
met for a few minutes and concluded to sail on <br/>
the following Thursday</p>

<p>The next day was an exceedingly <br/>
busy day for the Saints were coming in from the <br/>
various parts of [[England|England]] to sail for [[New York|New York]] on board <br/>
the ship Rochester with us among whom was <br/>
brother [[Edward Ockey|Ockey]] <strike>and family</strike> and brother [[John Fidoe|Fidoe]] and family <br/>
from [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]</p>

<p>With Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] I visited the <br/>
agents of the ship on which we were going and we <br/>
detained the ship one day on our account</p>

<p>This company was disposed to do <br/>
all they could to favour us for it was to their interest</p>",
42828.0,378,,"<p>relative to receiving an honourable burial with <strike>his</strike> ^my^ fathers<br/>
<strike>He</strike> ^I^ want<strike>ed</strike> to be laying by the sie of <strike>his</strike> ^my^ father when<br/>
the trumpet of God <strike>should</strike> ^shall^ sound and the voice of<br/>
God say ""Ye Saints arise so that when the toomb<br/>
<strike>should </strike>^shall^ burst <strike>he</strike> ^I^ <strike>could</strike> ^can^ arise from the grave and<br/>
first salute <strike>his</strike> ^my^ father and say O my Father! and<br/>
<strike>his</strike> ^my^ father O my Son! as they <strike>took</strike> ^we take^ each other by<br/>
the hand.</p>

<p><strike>He</strike> ^I^ wish<strike>ed</strike> next to salute <strike>his</strike> my brothers<br/>
and sisters and then the Saints.</p>

<p>It was upon this principle that<br/>
the ancients were so particular to have an honourable<br/>
burial with their fathers as in the case of Joseph. <br/>
Before his death he made his kindred promise to<br/>
carry <strike>to carry</strike> his bones to the land of [[Canaan|Canaan]] and<br/>
they did so. They embalmed his body and took<br/>
it to the land of Canaan and buried it with his fathers.</p>

<p>There is a glory in this which<br/>
many do not comprehend. It is true that on the<br/>
resurrection the Saints will be caught up to meet<br/>
the Lord and they will all be brought together though<br/>
their bodies were scattered upon the face of the whole<br/>
earth. Yet they could not as readily salute<br/>
each other as though ^they^ had laid down and rose up<br/>
together from the same bed.</p>

<p>To bring it to the understanding<br/>
it would be as though two who were very dear friends<br/>
indeed should lie down upon the same bed at night<br/>
locked in each others embrace talking of their love and<br/>
in the morning awaking together they could immediately<br/>
renew their conversations ^even^ while rising from their bed.<br/>
But if they were alone and in seperate appartments they<br/>
could not as readily salute each other as though they <br/>
were together.</p>

<p><strike>He remarked that</strike> Should<br/>
<strike>he</strike> ^I^ live and have an opportunity of gathering <strike>his</strike> ^my^<br/>
friends together who had died <strike>he</strike> ^I^ intended to do so<br/>
but should <strike>he</strike> ^I^ not live to do it <strike>him</strike>^my^self <strike>he</strike> ^I^ hoped that</p>",
42828.0,285,,"<p>by the horses harness and coaches and above are the families<br/>
of the coachmen grooms and those connected with the Mews</p>

<p>Mr [[James West|James West]] her Majestys state coachman<br/>
invited us to dine with him and we did so. We saw<br/>
all of his State dresses which were richly trimmed and<br/>
ornamented with gold. One coat was exceedingly heavy<br/>
in consequene of the weight of gold trimmings. When we<br/>
left him he made us a present of three small ornaments<br/>
for [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and Willford<br/>
Woodruff. They were made of fine polished brass<br/>
about 4 inches in circumference with a lion in the centre<br/>
and a crown upon the top. They were worn as ornaments<br/>
upon the Queen's State Coach. While at the Mews<br/>
we were allowed the privilege of being weighed in the<br/>
scales in which [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, b. 1819|Prince Albert]] was weighed. Elder<br/>
Kimballs weight was 160 mine was 142 which<br/>
was 2 pounds more than I had ever weighed before</p>

<p>The State coachman informed <br/>
me that her [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Majesty]] would be quite familiar and<br/>
even sociable in some respects with some of her subjects<br/>
but was kept distant by her Ministry</p>

<p>From the Royal Mews we walked<br/>
to the National Gallery and having viewed the<br/>
paintings we returned home somewhat weary for<br/>
we had walked ten miles in a rainy day</p>

<p>Next day we had a long and pleasant<br/>
days walk in accompanying brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
in his visit to [[St. Paul|St. Paul's]] and other noted places.</p>

<p>From the body of the cathedral<br/>
we ascended to the Whispering Gallery thence to the<br/>
Golden Gallery and then to the Ball where we all<br/>
three sat together 400 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Descending we visited the Library<br/>
the Bell the Clock and finally every part of the<br/>
building and lastly the Crypt among all the toombs<br/>
It cost 7/6 each to visit every part of the cathedral</p>

<p>From St. Pauls to the Monument<br/>
to its top and descending thence to [[London Bridge, London, Middlesex, England|London Bridge]]</p>",
42828.0,331,,"<p>as we had already given them many passengers anothe probability <br/>
was that we should give them many more.</p>

<p>They gave us and all our Company the <br/>
second <strike>deck</strike> ^cabin^ and for our quorum they fitted up a seperate room <br/>
at half price</p>

<p>Thus there was a great difference between <br/>
the circumstances of our landing in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] on the 11th of <br/>
January 1<strike>4</strike>840 as strangers in a strange land and penniless <br/>
and that of our setting sail on the 20th of <strike>May</strike> ^April^ 1841 with <br/>
a ship load of Saints and influence sufficient to detain the <br/>
sailing of the vessel at our will.</p>

<p>Truly the Lord had blessed us in a<br/>
degree unlooked for. Indeed it was a miracle what the Lord <br/>
had wrought by our hands since our arrival a little over a <br/>
year before and I was filled with amazem<strike>i</strike>ent as I looked <br/>
back for during that time we had established churches <br/>
in nearly all the principal towns and cities in [[England|England]] <br/>
baptized more than 5000 souls published 5000 Books <br/>
of Mormon 3000 Hymn Books 2500 vols of the<br/>
Millennial Star and about 50,000 tracts besides <br/>
gathering to America 1000 members of the Church and <br/>
establishing ^a great influence^ among the shiping companies of Liverpool <br/>
which in a few years after had grown to such importance<br/>
as to become quite a ruling power not only in Liverpool <br/>
but in England generally. Indeed to such proportions <br/>
did the emigration power and notoriety of the Church <br/>
grow that in its history our emigration agent has been <br/>
summoned before a committee of the House of Commons <br/>
upon emigration policy and the company of the Great <br/>
Eastern Steam Ship has sought of our people to charter <br/>
their Leviathan of the Sea</p>

<p>I spent the following day in running <br/>
to and fro through the city assisting the Saints. I <br/>
walked four miles in the evening on the sea shore with <br/>
a company of Saints and baptized two persons one <br/>
was Sister [[Elizabeth Ockey Amphlett|Elizabeth Ockey]]. Her sister [[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann]] accompanied <br/>
her to the water and they both much desire to sail <br/>
with us to America with their brother [[Edward Ockey|Edward]], but</p>",
42828.0,379,,"<p>some of his would ^will^</p>

<p><strike>He</strike> ^I^ wish<strike>ed</strike> all the Saints to be comforted<br/>
with the victory they w<strike>ere</strike>ill to gain by the resurrection.<br/>
It is sufficient to encourage the Saint to overcome in<br/>
the midst of every trial trouble and tribulation. Though<br/>
thunders roar and earthquakes bellow, lightnings flash<br/>
and wars be on every hand yet suffer not a joint to tremble<br/>
nor let your heart faint for the great Elohiem will<br/>
deliver you; and if not before, the resurrection will<br/>
set you eternally free from all those things and<br/>
from pain sorrow and death.</p>

<p>I have laboured hard and sought<br/>
every way to try to prepare this people to comprehend<br/>
the things which God is unfolding to me.</p>

<p>In speaking of the resurrection<br/>
I would say that God hath s^h^own unto me a<br/>
vision of the resurrection of the dead; and I saw<br/>
the graves open and the Saints as they arose took<br/>
each other by the hand even before they got up<br/>
or while getting up and great joy and glory rested<br/>
upon them.</p>",
42828.0,286,,"<p>which we crossed and continued to the Southwark<br/>
Suspension Bridge which we walked under viewed<br/>
and then crossed it. The Bridge is forty five rods<br/>
in length. We then dined in the city and<br/>
afterwards took a cab and rode to the Museum<br/>
and went through every appartment of it. This<br/>
ended the day and we returned to our lodgings<br/>
in a cab very weary and some what ^foot^ sore for<br/>
we had walked twelve miles and ascended<br/>
and descended twelve hundred steps. However<br/>
we enjoyed a good night's rest</p>

<p>On the morrow we walked over<br/>
Blackfriars and called at Zion's chapel to attend<br/>
a sacrament meeting of Mr. Aitken's society but <br/>
they knowing who we were would not let us in for<br/>
they feared lest we should break up their society<br/>
by the power of our mission.</p>

<p>Thus turned away we crossed home<br/>
and held meeting in the evening when I preached and<br/>
Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] bore strong testimony<br/>
to the people.</p>

<p>Next day Brother Brigham left<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] for [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|Cheltenham]] and I visited Mr [[James Albon|James<br/>
Albon]] a minister of the Independent order who with<br/>
his household beleived our doctrine and on the Sunday<br/>
we found more than ever an interest being awakened<br/>
in London, and our prayer meeting the next evening<br/>
was attended by the Reverend James Albon who received<br/>
our testimony. We walked home with him and<br/>
found his household growing in the faith and ready<br/>
for the work of the Lord.</p>

<p>Two days after in the evening we<br/>
baptized four two of whom were Mr and Mrs Morgan<br/>
with whom we lodged <strike>and their apprentice</strike> ^[[Christopher Smith|Christopher Smith]]^ and [[Henry Corner Jr.|Henry<br/>
Corner Jun<sup>r</sup>]]</p>",
42828.0,332,,"<p>they were not ready. I retired to bed at midnight very <br/>
weary with my day's labour</p>

<p>Next day seven of the Twelve and <br/>
120 Saints with them got our baggage on board to set <br/>
sail but the wind being contrary we staid on shore. <br/>
This was an exceedingly busy day in settling my business <br/>
and preparing for my voyage homewards.</p>

<p>Among other matters I received the<br/>
following Books of Mormon: 12 Morocca 9 shillings <br/>
each; 25 Gilt Edge 7 shillings; 89 marble edge six and <br/>
six pence; 35 Sheep 5 shillings each. Total value fifty <br/>
one pounds sixteen shillings and six pence. Of these <br/>
I made the following distributions; To [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Ezra Carter]] <br/>
and family, 9 Morocca lettered; My father and family <br/>
5 Morocca lettered; [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] 2 gilt edge 6 marble <br/>
edge &amp; 4 sheep skin bound; [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] 4 marble <br/>
edge and 2 sheep skin; and to others of the Saints I <br/>
made similar presents of Books of Mormon in all <br/>
to the number of 42.</p>

<p>The sisters [[Elizabeth Ockey Amphlett|Elizabeth]] and [[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann<br/>
Ockey]] made me a presrent of a nice neck-scarf silk <br/>
handkerchief and gold pin and their brother [[Edward Ockey|Edward]]<br/>
presented me with a purse of 50 sover<strike>e</strike>igns. Truly <br/>
this was liberality not often met; and as some of my <br/>
brethren were more needy than myself I devided a <br/>
portion of his generous gift with my companions; to <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] £5; Willard Richards £5; and George <br/>
A Smith £5. <strike>I said</strike> Truly the Lord ha<strike>s</strike>d been <br/>
good to us all On this mission and had given us all <br/>
that we needed.</p>

<p>I took tea with borther Edward Ockey <br/>
and sisters on my last evening on shore and in the <br/>
morning went on board the Rochester with Brigham <br/>
Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] George A. Smith <br/>
Willard Richards [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and [[Reuben Hedlock|R. Hedlock]]. We <br/>
bade farewell to [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and <br/>
a multitude of the Saints who stood upon the <br/>
quay to see us start and then the ship drew out </p>",
42828.0,380,,"<p>On the 19th of the month in Conference with<br/>
the Twelve [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] counciled us to take our mission<br/>
to the east to obtain means to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and<br/>
[[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] as we were appointed by the General<br/>
Conference on the 6th of April. At that anniversary<br/>
of the rise of the Church. The following persons were named<br/>
of the quorum of the Twelve for this mission to hold<br/>
Conferences in the east obtain means &amp;c:</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]]<br/>
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[William B. Smith|William Smith]] Willford<br/>
Woodruff and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]. [[John Edward Page|John E Page]]<br/>
was to join us in the east.</p>

<p>There were also ^some^ appointed for other<br/>
missions. [[Reuben Hedlock|Reuben Hedlock]] [[Samuel James|S James]] and [[John Carnes|J Carnes]]<br/>
were appointed to go to [[England|England]] and [[Addison Pratt|Addison Pratt]]<br/>
and three others were appointed to go to the [[Sandwich Islands|Sandwich<br/>
Islands]].</p>

<p>Brigham Young Heber C Kimball<br/>
Joseph Young G. A. Smith and [[Peter Haws|Peter Haws]] and myself<br/>
went to [[Augusta, Hancock County, Illinois|Agusta]] to hold Conference on Sunday<br/>
the 30th. He found about 200 Saints in this place.<br/>
They had started a flourishing vilage three saw<br/>
mills and two flowering mills and one of the best<br/>
water privileges I ever saw. We returned to<br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] on the first of May.</p>

<p>A company of about one hundred<br/>
gentlemen and ladies on the Maid of Iowa took a pleasure<br/>
excursion to [[Burlington, Kane County, Illinois|Burlington]]. Joseph his [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|lady]], his<br/>
[[Lucy Mack Smith|mother]] and family were of the party.</p>

<p>The Council of the Twelve met<br/>
two days after and appointed missions to England<br/>
[[Scotland|Scotland]] and the Pacific Isles.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 14th I was at [[Lima, Adams County, Illinois|Lima]] <br/>
with Joseph to hold meeting there. George A Smith<br/>
and [[Joseph Bates Noble|B. Nobles]] had also accompanied him while Brigham<br/>
Young Heber C. Kimball and Orson Pratt were filling<br/>
appointments elsewhere.</p>

42828.0,287,,"<p>The afternoon <strike>On</strike> ^of^ the following day Dr [[William Copeland|Copeland]] spent the<br/>
with us and he received our testimony and in the evening<br/>
we preached at our meeting place.</p>

<p>I had visited the Rev. [[James Albon|James Albon]]<br/>
several times and given him an account of the rise<br/>
and progress of the Church of Christ of Latter-day<br/>
Saints. He beleived in our mission and offered<br/>
me his chapel to preach in which would seat about<br/>
two thousand.</p>

<p>Sunday morning we accompanied<br/>
our reverend friend and convert to his chapel and were<br/>
introduced to the Commttee one of whom was a preacher<br/>
who had travelled much in [[Russia|Russia]] and other parts of<br/>
the world. At the close of the meeting the Rev. James<br/>
Albion gave out an appointment for us to preach<br/>
on the next Sabbath evening</p>

<p>In the afternoon we met with<br/>
the Saints confirmed four and had a full house<br/>
and in the evening we preached again and a good<br/>
feeling prevailed</p>

<p>After meeting the Rev James Albon<br/>
called upon us at our room and told us that he<br/>
had given out our appointment to preach in his<br/>
chapel and had informed his congregation that he<br/>
was a Latter-day Saint and should be baptized<br/>
and join our Church and that they need no longer<br/>
consider him a member of their body unless they<br/>
with him joined the Saints. He told us<br/>
this made a division among the Committee:<br/>
some were for going with him and some against<br/>
following their pastor into the true fold which<br/>
he had found.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the Monday<br/>
was spent with Dr Copeland with whom we went<br/>
to the ""Concerts d'Hiver"" and heard a fine performance<br/>
of a magnificient band of about 100 mostly German<br/>
and French conducted by Mr Ellason. It was<br/>

of April.</p>

<p>Next day Wednesday the 21st the wind being favourable <br/>
we weighed anchor at 12 o'clock and started on our voyage, and <br/>
had a good bre<strike>i</strike>^eze^ throughout the day but most of the passengers <br/>
were sea sick</p>

<p>The Rochester was a fast sailing vessel <br/>
of about 1000 tons and there was on board 1<strike>0</strike>20 Saints including <br/>
seven of the Twelve; 160 not of our people and the ships <br/>
company making in all 307 souls.</p>

<p>On the seventh day of our voyage <br/>
we had <strike>all the pleasure with a touch or two of the <br/>
disasters of</strike></p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Storm</u> <u>at</u> <u>Sea</u>.</p>

<p>In the morning we found strong head winds <br/>
which soon increased to a powerful storm and the scene <br/>
which followed was full of grandeur and considerable <br/>
discomfiture to our company.</p>

<p>The sails were taken in as soon as <br/>
possible and it took 16 men to close reef the main topsail</p>

<p>The tempest in its rage was now all <br/>
powerful &amp; the sea piled up into mountains. Ever and <br/>
anon our ship was thrown up on the crest of one of <br/>
those ocean mountains and then pitched into the Val<strike>e</strike>ley<br/>
beneath rocking tremendously and occassionly shiping <br/>
seas</p>

<p>In the midst of this was a cry for help <br/>
was heard in our cabin. I rushed to the scene from <br/>
whence the cry came and found the ropes giving <br/>
way which held the luggage piled up between decks <br/>
Had this broken loose one surge would have hurlled <br/>
heavy trunks barrels &amp;c into the births of the men <br/>
woman and children which would have endangered <br/>
the lives of many. On seeing the foundation <br/>
of this mass give way [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and <br/>
myself sprang to the place of danger and braced</p>",
42828.0,381,,"<p>a discourse of which I noted the following:</p>

<p><strike>Gems</strike> Items<br/>
of<br/>
<u>A</u> <u>Discourse by Joseph</u></p>

<p>""It is not wisdom that we should have all knowledge<br/>
presented at once before us but that we should have<br/>
a little at a time. Then we can comprehend it""</p>

<p>[The speaker then read the Second Epistle<br/>
of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] 1st ch. <strike>from the 16th to the last verse</strike> and<br/>
dwelt upon the 19th verse. Among other remarks<br/>
upon the words of the Apostle, ""And to your faith<br/>
knowledge"" &amp;c the Prophet said.]</p>

<p>""The Principle of knowledge is the principle<br/>
of salvation. This doctrine can be comprehended for any<br/>
one who <strike>cannot obtain</strike> ^will receive^ knowledge to be saved will be<br/>
damned.</p>

<p>The principle of salvation is given to<br/>
us through the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Salvation<br/>
is nothing more nor less than to triumph over all our<br/>
enemies and put them under our feet in this world<br/>
and a knowledge to triumph over all evil Spirits in<br/>
the world to come: Then we are saved; as in the<br/>
case of Jesus Christ. He was to reign until he<br/>
had put all enemies under his feet and the last enemy<br/>
was death.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is a principle here<br/>
that few men have thought of. No person can have<br/>
this salvation except through a tabernacle.</p>

<p>Now in this world mankind are<br/>
naturaly selfish and ambitious and striving to excel<br/>
one above another yet some are willing to build up <br/>
others as well as themselves.</p>

<p>So in the other world there is a variety<br/>
of spirits some of whom seek to excel. This was</p>",
42828.0,288,,"<p>I sat two hours and half for my<br/>
portrait on the Wednesday and had an interesting chat<br/>
with the artist Mr Pistrucci an Italian, in the midst<br/>
of which brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] called for me and I took<br/>
a walk with him and Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland]] and his [[Mrs. William Copeland|wife]]<br/>
over Blackfriars Bridge.</p>

<p>On our return home we lost<br/>
brother Kimball and sister Copeland in the crowd<br/>
and in looking for them I lost the Doctor &amp;<br/>
brother Kimball sister Copeland so that there were<br/>
no two of the four together. After awhile however<br/>
we all luckily met at [[Covent Garden, London, Middlesex, England|Covent Garden]] and saw<br/>
the wonderful performance of [[William Shakespeare|Shakspears]] Night<br/>
Dream and Madam [[Lucia Elizabeth Bartolozzi Vestris Mathews|Vestris]] the celebrated actress<br/>
and popular favourite.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve Brother Kimball<br/>
and myself went into the streets to see the busy<br/>
multitude returned to our room and took supper in<br/>
keeping with the season retired to bed and dreamed<br/>
of falling among thieves.</p>

<p>Christmas Day in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]</p>

<p>Christmas is the greatest day of the year in [[England|England]]<br/>
and this was the first Christmas day I ever spent in a <br/>
foreign land.</p>

<p>In the morning the church bells throughout<br/>
London chanted for meeting and the Saints also met for<br/>
service. After morning service comes what gives the<br/>
halo of glory and jolity to Old Christmas—the dinner. The<br/>
service of the day is something like the blessing before meat<br/>
but the Christmas ^dinner^ is an institution with the nation and<br/>
Christmas holds his feast of State in every city town and<br/>
hamlet—in every palace mansion and cottage and comfortless<br/>
is the wretched place which merry Christmas enters not</p>

<p>Our Christmas dinner was eat with brother<br/>
Morgan and family and the evening was spent with the<br/>
Rev. Mr. [[James Albon|Albon]] in conversing about the things of God.</p>",
42828.0,334,,"<p>ourselves against the barrels and held them for a  few moments until they were secured. I then went on <br/>
the deck to the Captain and informed him of the situation <br/>
of things below and he sent the sailors with some <br/>
ropes and they secured the pile.</p>

<p>Afterwards I again went to the aft<br/>
quarter deck to behold the raging of the tempest and <br/>
the wonders of the deep and the riding of our bark <br/>
on the mountain billows. It was the grandest <br/>
scenery I ever beheld upon the sea</p>

<p>Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] <strike>was</strike> ^were^ with me on deck for a time but <br/>
all had now gone below with the exception of Elder <br/>
Willard Richards myself the captain and crew</p>

<p>We were shipping heavy seas. It <br/>
was now past sunset and I stood in the middle of <br/>
the aft quarter deck holding the captain's speaking<br/>
trumpet it one hand and to a fast bench with the <br/>
other when we shipped a tremendious sea on the <br/>
windward side of us which passed clear over the<br/>
quarter deck upon which I stood.  On seeing that <br/>
we could not escape it Elder Richards threw himself <br/>
under the shelter of the bulwarks, and the body <br/>
of the wave went clear over him without wetting <br/>
him more than a little but as I could not <br/>
take the same advantage I threw myself <br/>
upon the deck and held fast to the seat until <br/>
the sea passed over me and left me drenched <br/>
with the Surge. I now though it time to leave <br/>
my seat of observations for the day. So I <br/>
went below and went to bed for I was thoroughly <br/>
wet.</p>

<p>I did not sleep however but little <br/>
for the ship rocked at a dreadful rate; boxes barrels <br/>
and tins were tumbling from one end of the cabin <br/>
to the other and in the steerage about fifteen births <br/>
were thrown down. I at one surge with men <br/>
woman and children flung into a heap. There</p>",
42828.0,382,,"<p>the case with the Devil. When he fell he sought for<br/>
things which were unlawful. Hence he was cast<br/>
down and it is said that he drew away many<br/>
with him and the greatness of his punishment<br/>
is that he shall not have a tabernacle. This<br/>
is his punishment.</p>

<p>So the Devil thinking to thwart<br/>
the decree of God goeth up and down the earth<br/>
seeking whom he may destroy. Any person<br/>
whom he can find who will yeild to him he<br/>
will find and take possession of the body and reign<br/>
there glorifying mightily forgeting that he has a<br/>
stolen body. By and by some one having authority<br/>
comes along and casts him out and restores the<br/>
tabernacle to its rightful owner. The devil steals<br/>
a tabernacle because he has not one of his own but<br/>
when he has stolen it he is liable to be turned out<br/>
of doors""</p>

<p>-[Upon the 19th verse the Prophet<br/>
rememarked]</p>

<p>Now there is some grand secret<br/>
here and a key to unlock the subject. Notwithstanding<br/>
the Apostle exhorts them to add to their faith virtue<br/>
knowledge temperance &amp;c yet he exhorts them to make<br/>
their calling and election sure. Though they had<br/>
heard the audible voice from heaven bearing testimony<br/>
that Jesus was the Son of God yet he says we have <br/>
a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well<br/>
that ye take heed as unto a light shining in a<br/>
dark place.</p>

<p>Now wherein could they have a<br/>
more sure word of prophecy than to hear the voice of<br/>
God saying this is my beloved Son? Now for the<br/>
secret and grand key.</p>

<p>Though they might have heard<br/>
the voice of the Father and know that Jesus was<br/>
the Son of God this would be no evidence that their<br/>
calling and election was made sure and that</p>",
42828.0,289,,"<p>The Sunday following in the evening we preached<br/>
by the appointment of its minister in the Indipendant chapel to<br/>
the largest congregation we had discoursed before, in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]].<br/>
There were present priests and people of many denominations. I<br/>
addressed them for about the space of one hour. A Wesleyan<br/>
Minister arose and opposed me which had a good effect<br/>
for the congregation seeing the spirit he was of turned<br/>
against him and the Committee refused him the permission<br/>
to speak there any more. I was much bound by the<br/>
opposing spirit still the conduct of ^the^ enemy gave us friends</p>

<p>The next evening we attended what<br/>
was said to have been the largest Temperance meeting<br/>
ever held in London and the next two days brought us<br/>
to the</p>

<strike>eighth</strike> ^seventh^ day in succession that we had strong head winds</p>

<p>Next day we had fair wind for the <br/>
first time and the sun shined pleasantly but the sea <br/>
was very rough from the gale</p>

<p>One day near this date I was requested <br/>
<strike>to</strike>by the brethren to carry the dishes to the cooks galley <br/>
So I got my hands full of dishes of various kinds and<br/>
just as I had reached the door of the galley the ship <br/>
gave a tremendious lunge so that she was thrown on <br/>
her beam ends with her stud sails in the water. This <br/>
unexpected pitch of the ship plunged me head foremost<br/>
about ten feet the whole length of the galley against <br/>
its side with the cook upon me</p>

<p>This was my first introduction <br/>
to the cook since I had been to sea. I beged his pardon <br/>
for such an abrupt enterance and withdrew leaving <br/>
the cook with three smashed fingers (caused by <br/>
trying to save me in the fall) to pick up my <br/>
dishes at leasure which were scattered from one end <br/>
of his galley to the other. I had no desire for a <br/>
long time to come to pay the cook a similar visit</p>

<p>Passing over the remaining incidents <br/>
of a voyage accross the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in an emigrant <br/>
ship we landed in [[New York|New York]] on the 20th of <br/>
May.</p>

<p>Next day [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and <br/>
myself took up our abode with Elder [[Lucian Rose Foster|L. R. Foster]]<br/>
who was glad to see us and made us welcome<br/>
and brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
took up lodgings at the house of Elder [[George Washington Joshua Adams|G. J. Adams]]</p>

<p>At this time I met my brothers in <br/>
law [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra]] and [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus Carter]] and also Dr [[Charles Wesley Fabyan|Charles<br/>
Fabyan]]</p>

<p>I had the purusal of the 12 and <br/>
13th Nos. of the Times and Seasons giving an <br/>
account of the laying of the corner stones of the <br/>
[[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|House of the Lord]] in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] in the presence</p>",
42828.0,383,,"<p>they had a part with Christ and was a point heir with him.<br/>
They would then need that more sure word of prophecy that<br/>
they were sealed in the heavens and had the promise<br/>
of Eternal Life in the Kingdom of God. Then having<br/>
this promise sealed unto them it was as an anchor to<br/>
their soul sure and steadfast. Though the thunders<br/>
might roll &amp; lightenings flash, earthquakes bellow and war<br/>
gather thick around yet this knowledge would support the<br/>
soul in every hour of trial and tribulation</p>

<p>Then knowledge through our Lord<br/>
and Saviour Jesus Christ is the grand key which unlocks<br/>
the glories and mysteries of the kingdom of heaven</p>

<p>Compare this principle of knowledge<br/>
which thus unlocks the glories and mysteries of the<br/>
Kingdom with Christendom at the present time and<br/>
where are they with all their religion piety and sacredness<br/>
Yet at the same time they are crying out against<br/>
Prophets Apostles Angels Revelations Visions &amp;c<br/>
Why they are just ripening for the damnation of<br/>
hell. They will be damned for they reject the<br/>
most glorious principle of the Gospel of Jesus Christ<br/>
and treat with disdain and trample under foot the<br/>
main key which unlocks the heavens and puts<br/>
into our possession the glories of the celestial world<br/>
Yes I say such will be damned with all their<br/>
professed godliness</p>

<p>""Then I would ^also^ exhort you to go on<br/>
and continue to call upon God until you make your<br/>
calling and election sure for yourselves by obtaining<br/>
this more sure word of prophecy and wait<br/>
patiently for the promise until you obtain it""</p>

<p>Many other choice remarks were made<br/>
on this occassion which I did not note down.</p>

that Sunday at which [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]]<br/>

<p>On this day May the 22nd the ceremony <br/>
of marriage was performed by Elder Woodruff between <br/>
Mr [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey]] and Miss [[Eliza Brewer Ockey|Eliza Brewer]] both from <br/>
[[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castle Froom]] Herefordshire at the house of Elder <br/>
[[John W. Latson|J. W. Latson]] in the presence of the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve.</p>

<p>This was the first marriage <br/>
ceremony I ever officiated in and I was much <br/>
interested in the welfare of the bride and bridegroom <br/>
for they were both my children in the Gospel and <br/>
Elder Edward Ockey had not only been munificient <br/>
in gifts to me but he has also given between two <br/>
and three hundred pounds to help the poor <br/>
Saints to emigrate</p>

<p>On the Sunday after we landed <br/>
the Council of the Twelve met; and afterwards at <br/>
our meeting place the National Hall Canal Street <br/>
for public worship. There was a large congregation <br/>
Many of the citizen were present besides the <br/>
Saints from [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and <br/>
various parts of England [[Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Scotland|Scotland]]</p>

<p>While in [[New York|New York]], with Dr <br/>
[[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
I visited the Frigates Brandy wine and North Carolina <br/>
and crossed the [[Hudson River, New York|river]] to [[new Jersey|Jersey]] side went through <br/>
the steam ship of war then building for the <br/>
[[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor]] of [[Russia|Russia]]. We also visited some of the<br/>
public buildings of New York</p>

<p>On the last of May with my <br/>
brotherin-law [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus Carter]] I took steamboat to <br/>
start to my family in the State of [[Maine|Maine]] for <br/>
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] soon after the death of my [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|daughter]] <br/>
was with my infant son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] taken to the home <br/>
of her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father]] by her brother, ^and brother in law^ Carter</p>

<p>On the 2nd of June I arrived <br/>
at [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] per stage and was once more <br/>
permitted to embrace my wife and also my first </p>",
42828.0,384,,"<p>supper with [[Calvin Bebe|Calvin Beaby]] and while we were conversing<br/>
with brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and brother [[Isaac Morley|Morely]] we were treated<br/>
to the following.</p>

<p><u>Sayings of the Prophet</u></p>

<p>""The way to get along in any important matters<br/>
is to call unto yourself wise men experienced and<br/>
aged to assist in council in all times of trouble.</p>

<p>""Handsome me are not wise and<br/>
strong minded men. The strength of a strong minded<br/>
man will create course features like a rough and<br/>
strong bough of the oak. You will always discover<br/>
in the first glance at a man in the outline of <br/>
his features something of the mind of the man""</p>

<p>Excitement has almost become the<br/>
essence of my life. When that dies away I feel<br/>
almost lost. When a man is reined up continually<br/>
he becomes strong and gains power and knowledge<br/>
but when he relaxes for a season he loses much<br/>
of his power.</p>

<p>But in all matters whether temporal<br/>
or spiritual—preaching the Gospel or leading an<br/>
army to battle victory almost entirely depends upon<br/>
moderation and good discipline. In going to battle<br/>
move slowly dress up into line and though your<br/>
enemy rush upon you with fury meet them with<br/>
calm firmness. Let not confussion seize your<br/>
breast but receive them slow and firmly; then<br/>
strike a heavy blow and conquer.</p>

<p>A man can bear a heavy burden<br/>
by practice and by continuing to increase it.</p>

<p>Chapter XVIII</p>

<p>New Year's Day</p>

<p>I found myself in the metropolis of [[England|England]] the most<br/>
famous city of the world and with me [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]]<br/>
and we both were in the enjoyment of good health.</p>

<p>The Church of Latter-Day Saints on this<br/>
new year's day 1841 in the City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] numbered 21<br/>
souls and I celebrated the commencement of the new<br/>
year by baptizing two into the fold of Christ. We dined<br/>
at Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland's]]</p>

<p>There was a heavy thunder storm on<br/>
the Sunday which damaged some of the churches in<br/>
the City. Notwithstanding we in the afternoon preached<br/>
in the Academy communed with the Saints and<br/>
confirmed two and ^preached^ again in the evening</p>

<p>We took tea with the Rev [[James Albon|James Albon]] <br/>
and Mr Spencer and were told that there was quite a<br/>
stir in the Indipendant Church where I had preached<br/>
the Sunday previous. Most of the Committee who<br/>
were eight in number were with their pastor beleiving<br/>
in our mission and there was a prospect of their being<br/>
baptized while others were much stirred up and<br/>
opposing.</p>

<p>A few days after in the evening we<br/>
accompanied the Rev. Mr Albon to London Dock to</p>",
42828.0,337,,"<p>born [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|son]] whom I had not before seen. After 2 years of<br/>
seperation from my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] it was a happy meeting now</p>

<p>Here I stayed with my [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|fatherin-law]] <br/>
until the 5th of July and then left for my native place <br/>
[[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] where I arrived on the 3rd day after.</p>

<p>While tarrying at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house <br/>
I married my sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice Woodruff]] to Mr [[Dwight Webster|Dwight<br/>
Webster]]. At</p>

<p>My Sister's Marriage</p>

<p>there were between 40 and fifty persons mostly our relatives <br/>
This was on the 4th of August 1841</p>

<p>A few days afterwards my aunt [[Beulah Hart|Bulah Hart]]<br/>
was baptized into the Church and on the 18th of the <br/>
month I bade farewell to my father's house after a stay <br/>
of forty one days. This was a longer visit than I had <br/>
paid to any of my friends for the last ten years.</p>

<p>Two days after we reached [[New Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven]] <br/>
the capitol of my native State which I had not seen <br/>
for 15 years and it gave me pleasure to see it once more</p>

<p>I arrived in [[New York|New York]] with my <br/>
family on the 12st. Here I learned the general news of <br/>
the day which was fully ominous and rumours of war between <br/>
[[England|England]] and America heard on every hand</p>

<p>The Millennial Stars from England <br/>
as well as the letters received informed me of the rapid <br/>
progress of the work in that country <strike>in the midst of <br/>
unparalelled</strike> opposition.</p>

<p>From the Times and Seasons I <br/>
gathered the items that the work in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] was progressing <br/>
in the midst of opposition and that all the returned <br/>
members of the Twelve excepting myself had arrived <br/>
there. It also brought the melancholy tidings of the <br/>
death of [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith]] editor of the Times and Seasons <br/>
The news generally informed me both of the success and <br/>
unequalled efforts both in America and England to overthrow <br/>
the Church. All earth and hell seemed united for one <br/>
great effort. Public meetings were being held and <br/>
news papers teening against us. </p>",
42828.0,385,,"<p>so constituted and were so determined and persevering<br/>
either in righteousness or wickedness that God visited<br/>
them immediately either with great judgements or blessings.</p>

<p>""If the present generation obtain any assistance from<br/>
God they will have to obtain it by faith.""</p>

<p>As I had spent most of my time for the last<br/>
ten years in the vineyard and would probably spend<br/>
much more in the future the brethren and myself<br/>
talked over the desireableness of my building a house<br/>
for my family to be comfortable in my absence.<br/>
Several profered to assist me to brick and other materials<br/>
and brother [[John Fidoe|John Fidoe]] would superintend the building<br/>
So on the 22nd of May we went on to the ground<br/>
and laid out the dimensions of the house.</p>

<p>Next day the Twelve set apart Elders<br/>
[[Noah Rogers|Noah Rogers]] [[Addison Pratt|Addison Pratt]] [[Benjamin Franklin Grouard|Benjamin F. Grouard]]<br/>
and [[Knowlton Hanks|Knowlton Hanks]] to take mission to the [[Sandwich Islands|Sandwich <br/>
Islands]] and Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and [[John Carnes|J Carnes]] to [[England|England]]<br/>
Elder Hedlock was appointed to preside after the British<br/>
Isles. The Spirit of the Lord was with us in<br/>
setting apart these brethren and the blessings pronounced<br/>
upon their heads were written by Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]]</p>

<p><u>A Trial</u><br/>
before<br/>
The Twelve and First Presidency</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 27th I met in council<br/>
with the Twelve and First Presidency when the case of<br/>
[[Benjamin Winchester|Benjamin Winchester]] was brought up on trial for<br/>
slandering the Saints in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] rejecting the <br/>
counsel of [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and the Twelve and for<br/>
tearing down instead of building up</p>

<p>Hyrum plead for mercy Joseph for<br/>
right and the Twelve decided according to the testimony</p>",
42828.0,292,,"<p>house of Mr Spencer to hold a meeting. There were<br/>
only six present and five were preachers. One by the<br/>
name of Canon was full of the devil and hypocr<strike>s</strike>isy<br/>
and he rejected our testimony and opposed the work<br/>
In fact we found that we could not go out to teach in <br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] without the Devil coming to oppose us.</p>

<p>^Bro [[Brigham Young|Young]]^ In letter to brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] informed<br/>
us that the two brethren who went from [[Longton, Lancashire, England|Longton]] Lancashire<br/>
to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to spy out the land had returned strong in the faith<br/>
and also told us that 500 Books of Mormon were out of<br/>
press and in the process of binding.</p>

<p>About this time I baptized the [[Susanna Elizabeth Albon Ware|daughter]]<br/>
of the Rev. [[James Albon|James Albon]] and the day after Elder Kimball<br/>
started to [[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] to break up the ground there. The<br/>
following Sunday was the first time he preached when<br/>
four persons offered themselves for baptism.</p>

<p>They walked up and down the [[River Thames, England|river<br/>
Thames]] until 9 o'clock at night to find a place to<br/>
administer the ordinance but could not because of<br/>
the mud and ice. So on the morrow they came <br/>
with Elder Kimball to [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] to receive the ordinance<br/>
of the Gospel.</p>

<p>We immediately repared to our private<br/>
bath in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]] and Elder Kimball<br/>
baptized five persons one of whom was Dr. [[William Copeland|William <br/>
Copeland]].</p>

<p>This was indeed an interesting occasion<br/>
and we felt thankful to God to see the cloud begining<br/>
to break for we had struggled hard to do the little<br/>
which had been done.</p>

<p>On the 15th of the mouth we baptized<br/>
three more of brother [[Benjamin Morgan|Morgan's]] household and on the <br/>
following Sunday I preached to a full house and to many<br/>
new hearers. Several offered themselves for baptism<br/>
and there had been during the week added unto the<br/>
Church seven souls.</p>

<p>Next day Elder Kimball received<br/>
a letter from Elder Young who wished us to be</p>",
42828.0,338,,"<p>On the 9th of September a little company consisting <br/>
of myself [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|son]] and four others started on board <br/>
the boat Sandusky for [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]]. Our ultimate <br/>
destination was [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] were arrived on the <br/>
6th of the next month.</p>

<p>While on our journey up the <br/>
rivers and on board the Chesepeak bound for [[Chicago, Cook County, Illinois|Chicago]] <br/>
we stoped at [[Manitou Islands, Lake Michigan, Leelanau County, Michigan|Manit<strike>aw</strike>ou Island]] on account of rough weather <br/>
where we lay by until 4 o'clock in the afternoon <br/>
of the same day and then put off again</p>

<p>At 12 o'clock at night a tremendious<br/>
storm arose. The captain officers crew and passengers <br/>
all expected to go to the bottom and juedging from <br/>
outward appearances there were twenty chances to one<br/>
that we should be lost but I experienced no fear <br/>
and felt confident that the Lord would save us by <br/>
some means. We were in the gale 24 hours when <br/>
we succeeded in returning to Manitau Island.</p>

<p>When I left Nauvoo two years <br/>
before there were not more than a dozen houses in <br/>
the place but on my return to the City there <br/>
were several hundreds</p>

<p>We passed by the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] then <br/>
building and had a view of it; and then called <br/>
at the house of Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]. Here we <br/>
spent the night.</p>

<p>Brother Brigham was sick and <br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] were with <br/>
him. We laid hands upon him and he soon <br/>
recovered</p>

<p>I saw many of my old friends <br/>
and aquaintances and was informed that others of <br/>
them were dead.</p>

<p>I met with many friends on the <br/>
day after my return to Nauvoo and also sat in <br/>
council with the Twelve and was happy once more <br/>
to meet with my quorum. I moved my things <br/>
to Elder Kimball's. My wife and child were sick, </p>",
42828.0,386,,"<p>in the case.</p>

<p>Several letters were read touching the<br/>
subject and then Elder [[Benjamin Winchester|Winchester]] made a lengthy<br/>
speech trying to justify himself.</p>

<p>President [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] followed and plead<br/>
in behalf of mercy</p>

<p>Elder [[George Washington Joshua Adams|George J Adams]] gave<br/>
his testimony against Winchester who afterwards<br/>
followed him and both spoke several times.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Prophet arose and<br/>
rebuked Elder Winchester in the sharpest manner<br/>
and said he had a lying spirit</p>

<p>After hearing the testimony in the<br/>
case [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] President of the Twelve said he<br/>
had made up his mind and his decision was<br/>
that Elder Winchester should give up his license<br/>
and cease preaching until he should reform</p>

<p>President Hyrum Smith said<br/>
he should not like to have such a decision given<br/>
without another trial to give Elder Winchester a<br/>
chance to get more testimony if he could.</p>

<p>President Young said he should<br/>
then prefer the case turned over to the High Council</p>

<p>Joseph said it was not the business<br/>
of the High Council but belonged to the Twelve and<br/>
they alone for it concerned matters abroad and<br/>
not in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. The High Council's business<br/>
was to try cases belonging to the city and that of<br/>
the Twelve to regulate the churches and Elders abroad<br/>
in all the world and Elder Winchester came under<br/>
that jurisdiction</p>

<p>Hyrum urged the case to be put off<br/>
until the next day.</p>

<p>Joseph said the case might be<br/>
put of until the next morning if it would do<br/>
anybody any good.</p>

<p>Then President Brigham Young<br/>
arose and spoke in the majesty of his calling</p>",
42828.0,293,,"<p>ready to set sail for home early in April.</p>

<p>The day after brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] returned from<br/>
[[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] a second time and we held a prayer meeting in the <br/>
evening but he was unable to be present at our next preaching<br/>
meeting from indisposition.</p>

<p>During this week we both took the last<br/>
sittings for our portrait and with Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland]] visited<br/>
the largest docks in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]].</p>

<p>First we visited St. Catherine's Dock<br/>
and after viewing the shipping and freight of every description<br/>
we next went to the London Dock</p>

<p>Among many other things we saw the<br/>
Eastern Wine Vault. This is much the largest vault<br/>
in the world. It is altogether underground and covers<br/>
nine English acres.</p>

<p>The whole vault is supported with<br/>
tremendous arches and pillars and laid off in the form<br/>
of streets. It had been built 33 years.</p>

<p>We walked through the length and<br/>
breadth of the vault with a guide each one carrying a<br/>
lighted lamp in his hand. Over our heads were the<br/>
street and city.</p>

<p>This vault alone contains thirty thousand<br/>
Pipes of the best Port Wine and six thousand Pipes of Sherry<br/>
and ^the lower^ three minor vaults of great extension filled with<br/>
the same article; besides many thousand Pipes of wine<br/>
<strike>and</strike> Brandy Gin and other liquors were strewed through<br/>
all the docks warfs and storehouses. We had a tasting<br/>
order and found the wine of the rarest quality. But it <br/>
was pitiful to think of the vast sums of money<br/>
spent in intoxicating liquors while thousands were<br/>
nearly starving for bread in the streets.</p>

<p>Leaving this scene we called into<br/>
a Jewish Synagogue and stayed during worship<br/>
and then returned to our room.</p>

<p>I called for Mr [[Brother Hender|Hender]] and he<br/>
came home with me and soon the Rev. [[James Albon|James <br/>
Albon]] also came and we all went to the bath in</p>",
42828.0,339,,"<p>I was quite unsettled where to turn or which <br/>
way to settle myself. Some of my quorum thought it <br/>
best for me to got to [[Warsaw, Hancock County, Illinois|Warsaw]] with Elder [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] but after <br/>
meeting in Conference with the Twelve it was voted that I <br/>
should locate myself in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>The temporal business of the Church was <br/>
laid upon the quorum of the Twelve.</p>

<p>On the 30th of October the City Council met <br/>
[FIGURE] &amp; among its business I was appointed one of the City Council of <br/>
Nauvoo.</p>

<p>^Commence here^</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday and I met with <br/>
the Twelve and the Presidency at the office of [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum<br/>
Smith]] and spent most of the day in Council</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] severely reproved [[Benjamin Winchester|Benjamin <br/>
Winchester]] for getting out of his place, after which he <br/>
taught us principle for several hours. He spoke upon <br/>
the gathering of the nations for the building up of the Kingdom <br/>
of God &amp;c.</p>

<p>Six days afterwards I attended the <br/>
City Council for the first time and was sworn into my <br/>
office as Councillor</p>

<p>On the seventh which was also Sunday <br/>
I for the first time since my return with some of the <br/>
Twelve called upon brother Joseph thence to brother <br/>
Brigham Young's and then to the meeting.</p>

<p>Here I found many hundreds of <br/>
the Elders and members of the Church gathered and Elder <br/>
[[William Oglesby Clark|William Clark]] preached for about two hours</p>

<p>When he had closed brother Joseph <br/>
arose and reproved him as pharisceeical and hypocritical <br/>
and ^said^ that he had not edified the people</p>

<p>The Prophet then delivered unto us <br/>
and edifying address showing us what temperance faith <br/>
virtue charity and truth were. He also said if we <br/>
did not accuse one another God would not accuse us <br/>
If we had no accuser we should enter into the Kingdom <br/>
of heaven. He would take us there and if we would <br/>
not accuse him he would not accuse us. He said </p>",
42828.0,387,,"<p>and among other remarks [[Brigham Young|he]] said that his mind was made<br/>
up and that <strike>neither</strike> the remarks of brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] <strike>nor of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]</strike><br/>
had altered it. As for himself he would not sit upon the<br/>
case another day. He considered it an insult upon his<br/>
office and calling as an Apostle of Jesus Christ and he<br/>
would not bear it. As for the rest of the Twelve they<br/>
might do as they pleased; for himself he would not do<br/>
so. [[Benjamin Winchester|Benjamin Winchester]] had despised and rejected the<br/>
counsel of the Presidency and the Twelve and had said<br/>
they had no jurisdiction over him in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] <br/>
and power to say where he should go &amp;c. But he and<br/>
others will find that there is power in the Twelve.<br/>
We know from whom we have received our power<br/>
and who are our benefactors and we are thankful<br/>
for it. Benjamin Winchester has never for the<br/>
first time received our counsel but has gone contrary<br/>
to it. No one is safe in his hands. He calls <br/>
Hyrum an old granny and slanders everybody.<br/>
He says there is contradiction between Hyrum and<br/>
the Twelve. There is no contradiction between<br/>
us and Hyrum, is there brother Hyrum. (He <br/>
answered, ""No."")</p>

<p>After Brigham closed Joseph said<br/>
he would give us a little counsel if we saw fit to<br/>
take it. He thought it proper for us to silence<br/>
Elder Winchester take his license and have him<br/>
come to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with his family and if he would<br/>
not do so then let him go out of the Church</p>

<p>A vote was then taken to that effect.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph addressed the Twelve and said<br/>
""In all your councils and especially on trial you should<br/>
observe all pertaining to the subject and discern the<br/>
spirit by which either party is governed. We should<br/>
be in a situation to understand every spirit and<br/>
judge righteous judgement and should not let the council<br/>
be imposed upon by an unruly conduct</p>

<p>""The Saints need not think because<br/>
I am familiar with them and am playful and cheerful</p>",
42828.0,294,,"<p>in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]] and I baptized the Rev. Mr [[James Albon|Albon]]<br/>
and [[Brother Hender|Mr Hender]]</p>

<p>Next day we held a prayer meeting<br/>
with the Saints and in the afternoon confirmed one<br/>
and blessed one child. We took tea with brother Albon<br/>
and met a full congregation in the evening</p>

<p>The Opening of Parliament<br/>
Jan 26 1841.</p>

<p>This was a great day in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and as Travellers<br/>
from another nation as well as missionaries of the <br/>
Gospel we did not lose the opportunity of witnessing<br/>
the opening of the British Parliament.</p>

<p>I started in company with<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland]] and several others for<br/>
[[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St James Park]] where we arrived at 10 o'clock and<br/>
found the citizens of London massing by tens of<br/>
thousands for the purpose of having a view of her<br/>
[[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Majesty]] as she passed through the Park to the<br/>
House of Lords to open Parliament</p>

<p>Long before two o'clock the whole<br/>
line from [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]] through St. James'<br/>
Park along Whitehall and Parliament Street leading<br/>
to the House of Lords was one continuous mass of<br/>
the inhabitants of London. The windows of the<br/>
houses all along <strike>was</strike> ^were^ crowded with fashionable dressed<br/>
ladies, in white on Richmond Terrace, and on the steps<br/>
at the base of the Duke of York's monument were<br/>
immense bodies of people.</p>

<p>It was judged that there<br/>
<strike>was</strike> ^were^ from three to four hundred thousand gathered<br/>
on this occassion but notwithstanding this immense<br/>
body of people we had the good fortune through<br/>
the favour of one of the Queen's Life Guards<br/>
to get a place in the front line.</p>

<p>Her Majesty started a quarter<br/>
before 2 o'clock. The cortege consisted of five</p>",
42828.0,340,,"<p>what many persons called sin was not sin and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|he]] did <br/>
many things to break down superstition.</p>

<p>After the close I met with the Twelve <br/>
and High Priest quorum. The ''Word of Wisdom"" <br/>
having been brought up Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] <br/>
said, ""Shall I break the ""Word of Wisdom if I go home <br/>
and drink a cup of tea?"" No; Wisdom is justified <br/>
of her children."" The subject was discussed in <br/>
an interesting manner and the conclusion reached <br/>
that we should deal with such matters in wisdom <br/>
and that forced abstinence was not making us <br/>
free, but putting a yoke upon our necks</p>

<p>Baptisimal Font Dedicated</p>

<p>The <br/>
First Baptisms for the Dead.</p>

<p>Two weeks afterwards which was Sunday the <br/>
21st of November after meeting in council <br/>
with the Twelve at brother Brigham Young's <br/>
I met with the General Assembly near the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] <br/>
and heard a discourse by Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] followed by <br/>
President [[Hyrum Smith|Hyram Smith]].</p>

<p>Afterwards the Twelve met at <br/>
President Young's until 4 o'clock when we repaired <br/>
to the Baptisimal Font in the Temple for the <br/>
purpose of baptizing for the dead for the remission <br/>
of sins and for the healing of the sick</p>

<p>It was truly an interesting scene <br/>
It was the</p>

<p>First Font</p>

<p>built in this last dispensation for the glorious <br/>
provision of the Gospel for the salvation of both <br/>
the living and the dead</p>

<p>It was dedicated by President <br/>
Joseph Smith and the Twelve and this was the first</p>",
42828.0,388,,"<p>that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] am ignorant of what is going on. Iniquity of any<br/>
kind cannot be retained in the Church, <strike>of any kind</strike>, and<br/>
it will not fare well where I am for I am determined<br/>
that while I do lead the Church to lead them right""</p>

<p>Joseph farther ^said^ as concerning Elder [[George Washington Joshua Adams|Adams]]<br/>
that he had given satisfaction to him confessed<br/>
wherein he had done wrong and had asked for<br/>
mercy intending to take a right course and begin<br/>
a new in the church.</p>

<p>After much instruction from Joseph <br/>
the council adjourned.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
met in Council at President Joseph Smith's [[Red Brick Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|store]] to make<br/>
some arrangements to start on their mission to collect<br/>
funds for the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]]. We each of<br/>
us was bound made, a bond of two thousand dollars<br/>
for the faithful performance of our duty in making<br/>
strict returns to the Trustee in Trust of all property<br/>
put into our hands. Elder [[Aaron Johnson|Aaron Johnson]] was<br/>
my bondsman</p>

<p>President Joseph Smith gave me<br/>
the following</p>

<p>""<u>To</u> <u>all Saints</u> <u>and</u> <u>Honourable</u> <u>Men of the</u> <u>earth Greeting:</u></p>

<p>""Dear Brethren and Friends,</p>

<p>I Joseph Smith a Servant of<br/>
the Lord and Trustee in Trust for the Church<br/>
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints do hereby<br/>
certify that the bearer hereof Willford Woodruff<br/>

carriage in which were her [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Majesty]] and [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, b. 1819|Prince Albert]]<br/>
who sat on her right.</p>

<p>The Queen's Body Guard ^formed^ by the Royal Blues<br/>
the Life Guards did duty on the line. The State carriage<br/>
was drawn by eight of the cream coloured Hanoverian<br/>
horses which we had seen at the Royal Mews.</p>

<p>The whole train passed within ten<br/>
feet of us so that we had a fair view of the Queen and<br/>
Prince Albert both going and returning from the House<br/>
of Lords. Her Majesty was of small stature and<br/>
plain in features and her dress was a plain white<br/>
satin trimed with white lace and she wore a necklace<br/>
of brillants. Prince Albert was quite a handsome man<br/>
They continually bowed to the people as they passed along<br/>
On her return to the Palace she appeared much fatigued.</p>

<p>It was the grandest earthly sight<br/>
I ever saw.</p>

<p>Before the close of the month I <br/>
baptized three more into the church and on the <br/>
2nd of Feb. we went to [[Stationers|Stationers Hall]] near [[St. Paul|Saint<br/>
Paul's]] where Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] made enquiries concerning<br/>
the securing of the copyright of the Book of Mormon<br/>
and on our way we saw a large fire in Finsbury Square<br/>
but it was partly extinguished.</p>

<p>The following evening we held<br/>
a meeting and had a good time and appointed a<br/>
committee to hire a preaching room. They were Dr<br/>
[[William Copeland|Copeland]] Rev [[James Albon|James Albon]] and Priest [[John Cooper|John Cooper]].<br/>
Brother ^Albon^ wished to make Elder Kimball and myself<br/>
a gilt frame each for our portraits which we accepted.</p>

<p>I received a letter from Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]]<br/>
informing me that he had commenced building up a<br/>
Church in the city of [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]]. He had baptized five<br/>
and organized a Branch of nine members</p>

<p>On the 4th we took the rail to<br/>
[[Greenwich, Kent, England|Greenwich]] which stands upon the banks of the</p>",
42828.0,341,,"<p>time the font had been prepared for the reception of candidates <br/>
on the Sabath</p>

<p>A large congregation assembled and Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] went forward <br/>
and baptized about forty persons and Elders [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] <br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and myself assisted in confirming them <br/>
Afterwards I spent the evening with the quorum of the Twelve <br/>
at brother Heber C. Kimballs.</p>

<p>On the 24 of this month I took charge <br/>
of the [[Nauvoo Provision Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Provision Store]] for the Committee of the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]]</p>

<p>The next day about 200 Saints landed at <br/>
[[Warsaw, Hancock County, Illinois|Warsaw]] from [[England|England]] and there being a heavy snow storm <br/>
I sympathized with them under the hard circumstances of <br/>
their arrival</p>

<p>The following Sunday was spent <br/>
at Brigham Young's with the Twelve and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] conversing<br/>
upon a variety of subjects. It was an interesting day <br/>
Elder [[Joseph Fielding|Joseph Fielding]] was present having been four years <br/>
on mission to England. We also saw a number of the <br/>
English brethren.</p>

<p>Joseph the Prophet said that</p>

<p>The Book of Mormon was the most Correct as <br/>
the word of God of any Book on Earth and that a man <br/>
would get nearer to God by abiding in its precepts than <br/>
by that of any other book. He said it is the key <br/>
stone of our religion.</p>

<p>Next Sunday with my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and <br/>
sister [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimball]] I spent a part of the day at brother <br/>
[[Richard Rushton|Rushtons]] with a number of the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Pottery]] Saints from <br/>
[[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]].</p>

<p>Indeed I was now in the midst of <br/>
hundreds whom I had baptized in America the Islands <br/>
of the Sea and in England and [[Wales|Wales]] who had now gathered <br/>
to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and I was occassionally receiving and <br/>
paying them visits. Among these were Elders [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] <br/>
[[John Benbow|Benbow]] [[Edward Ockey|Ockey]] [[Daniel Browett|Brewett]] [[William Hill Pitt|Pitt]] and a number of <br/>
others whose names are familiar in my history</p>",

with me his bond and security to my full satisfaction<br/>
according to the resolution of the Conference held in this<br/>
city on the 6th day of April 1843.</p>

<p>He therefore is recommend to all Saints and<br/>
honourable people as a legal agent to collect ^funds^ for the purpose<br/>
of building the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] and [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] of the Lord.</p>

<p>Confident that he will honour this high<br/>
trust as well as ardently fulfill his commission as a<br/>
Messenger of Peace and Salvation as one of the Lord's<br/>
noble men I can fervently say, May the Lord clear<br/>
his way before him and bless him and bless those that<br/>
obey his teachings wherever there are ears to hear and<br/>
hearts to feel.</p>

<p>He is in the language of the Hebrews<br/>
""The friend of [[Israel|Israel]]"" and worthy to be received and<br/>
entertained as a man of God. Yea he has (as<br/>
had the ancient Apostle) the Good Word that leadeth<br/>
unto Eternal Life.</p>

<p>Wherefore brethren and friends while<br/>
you hear the assurance of the integrity fidelity and ability<br/>
of this servant of the Living God trusting that your hearts<br/>
and energies will be enlivened and deeply engaged in the<br/>
building of these houses directed by revelation for the<br/>
salvation of all Saints and that you will not rest where<br/>
you are until all things are prepared before you and<br/>
you are gathered home with the rest of Israel to meet<br/>
your God, I feel strong in the belief and have a growing<br/>
expectation that you will not withhold any means in <br/>
your power that can be used to accomplish this glorious<br/>
work.</p>

<p>Finally as one that greatly desires<br/>
the salvation of man let me remind you all to<br/>
strive with a Godly zeal for virtue holiness and the<br/>
commandments of the Lord. Be wise be just be<br/>
liberal and above all be charitable, always abounding<br/>
in all good works. And may health peace and</p>",

Americans take their longitude.</p>

<p>We walked from [[Greenwich, Kent, England|Greenwhich]]<br/>
to [[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] also upon the banks of the Thames and<br/>
the most important naval and military post in [[England|England]]</p>

<p>There was at this time a small<br/>
church at Woolwhich numbering six members which<br/>
had been raised up by Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]. That evening<br/>
we met five of them at brother [[Richard Bates|Bates]] and we<br/>
found the Woolwhich Saints through few firm<br/>
in the faith</p>

<p>It was very cold the next day<br/>
and I spent the morning of the fire side of brother<br/>
Bates reading the Life and Death of the Reverend<br/>
[[John Fletcher|John Fletcher]] but in the afternoon we took a view<br/>
of the town and its places of note and in spite of<br/>
the cold we had a most interesting time.</p>

<p>First we visited the [[Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich, Kent, England|Artillary]]<br/>
and [[Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich, Kent, England|Marine Barracks]] passed through and<br/>
had a view of their Drill and Parade ground</p>

<p>As cold as it was there were<br/>
a number of companies on parade and new recruits<br/>
under drill and one horse company exers<strike>s</strike>ising. There<br/>
were many hundreds of cannon which we saw<br/>
and inspected one measuring 16 feet in length 3 1/2 in<br/>
diameter at the britch and 2 at the mouth</p>

<p>There were two soldiers being<br/>
burried at the time and with the usual military<br/>
display. We were present and saw them lowered<br/>
into the grave side by side. Then the chaplain read<br/>
the burial service and a company of soldiers fired<br/>
three rounds over their graves and retired. All<br/>
tended to make the view before us picturesque<br/>
though the latter scene gave a melancholy shade</p>

<p>We next visited the Dock and<br/>
Prison yard. This is the largest and most interesting<br/>
Dock yard in the world.</p>",
42828.0,342,,"<p>In the evening we walked to Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] and <br/>
spent several hours with him and Sister [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma]] and <br/>
had a very pleasant visit</p>

<p>Joseph had commenced this day <br/>
to proofread the Book of Mormon that it might <br/>
be sterotyped. He had read 60 pages. He <br/>
rehearsed over to us the [[Missouri|Missouri]] transactions and <br/>
spoke of the death of [[David Wyman Patten|David Patten]] and the request <br/>
which he made of him in his last dying <br/>
moments.</p>

<p>Two weeks later in the evening of <br/>
Sunday I met with the Twelve at Joseph's the Seer<strike>s</strike> <br/>
and heard a discourse delivered by [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] <br/>
He spake of the parable of Jeremiah concerning <br/>
the Potter and the clay. He said that when it was <br/>
marred in the hands of the potter, it had to be thrown <br/>
asside to go into the next batch and was accounted <br/>
as a vessel of dishonour but that which formed well <br/>
and was pliable in the hands of the Potter became a <br/>
vessel of honour. So also he said it was with the <br/>
human ^family^ and their Creator. Joseph said that brother <br/>
Kimball had given the true explanation of the parable</p>

<p>After [[Sidney Roberts|Sidney Roberts]] had further <br/>
occupied the meeting for a season Joseph the Seer <br/>
arose and read from the New Testament the parable <br/>
of the ""Vine"" and its ""Branches"" and explained it much <br/>
to our edification</p>

<p>The Prophet observed during his remarks <br/>
that some said he was a fallen prophet because he <br/>
did not bring forth more of the word of the Lord <br/>
Why does he not do it? was their cry. We are able <br/>
to receive it!"" But he said unto us—""No not one <br/>
in this room is prepared</p>

<p>In revelation he remarked ""that a man <br/>
might command his son to do a thing and before he had <br/>
done it and with sufficient reason <strike>before he had done it</strike><br/>
tell him to do something else and it was considered <br/>
right. But if the Lord gives a command and afterwards</p>",

<p>City of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
June 1st 1843</p>

<p>On the 11th a large Assembly of Saints met at<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and were addressed by the Prophet.<br/>
His subject was upon</p>

<p><u>The</u> <u>Gathering</u> — <u>Baptism</u> <u>for the</u> <u>Dead</u> — The <u>Spirits</u><br/>
<u>in</u> <u>prison</u> <u>the</u> <u>Different</u> <u>Glories</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>Godhead</u></p>

<p>He took for the foundation of his discourse the<br/>
words of Jesus to the Jews—""How oft would I<br/>
have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her<br/>
chicken under her wings but ye would not""</p>

<p>From his discourse I called some of<br/>
the points and noted them in my journal. He<br/>
asked—</p>

<p>""What was the object of gathering the<br/>
Jews or the people of God together in any age<br/>
of the world? The main object was to build<br/>
unto the Lord an House whereby he could reveal <br/>
unto His people the ordinances and glories of his<br/>
Kingdom and teach them the ways of salvation; for<br/>
there are certain ordinances and principles which<br/>
when they are taught and practised must be<br/>
done in a House or Temple built for that purpose</p>

<p>This was ordained in the mind of<br/>
God before the world was and it was for this purpose<br/>
that He designed oft to gather together the Jews but<br/>
they would not.</p>

<p>It is for the same reason that<br/>
God gathers together the people in the last days</p>",
42828.0,297,,"<p>On passing through the gate into the yard we recorded<br/>
our names and residences on a book and was then conducted<br/>
by Mr [[John Finsbury|John Finsbury]] policeman to all parts of the yard<br/>
and saw all the branches of business carried on by government<br/>
there.</p>

<p>There are employed in this yard hundreds<br/>
of hands besides seven hundred prisoners. These were<br/>
engaged in building vessels steem boats ships of war making<br/>
anchors cables chains boilers cannon shot ^&amp;c^ The fires or<br/>
bellows were all worked by steem and the operation of the<br/>
engines were pointed out to us.</p>

<p>Among many other curiousities we saw<br/>
the Hydrolic Press by which the strength of all the anchors<br/>
and cables are tested. With this small Press they can<br/>
readily break 150 tons weight and can snap an anchor<br/>
of five tons into pieces like a pipe stem</p>

<p>There were specimens of timber<br/>
which had been buried in the earth to see which<br/>
would stand the longest and it was found that the<br/>
English Oak stood the longest</p>

<p>We saw the boat in which Captian<br/>
Ross and his comrads were saved. Then we went<br/>
on to the upper deck of the new 120 gun ship Trafalgar<br/>
It had been upon the stocks a number of years but<br/>
was to be launched the following May. It was<br/>
considered as large as any ship then on the sea. He<br/>
also saw the convict ship</p>

<p>We left the Dock yard and went<br/>
to Bro [[A. Painter|Painter's]] house and had refreshments and then<br/>
we took the steam boat for [[London, Middlesex, England|London]].</p>

<p>A letter from sister [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] to Elder<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] informed us that the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
was going to write for the Twelve to hold a Conference<br/>
in [[England|England]] in the Spring ordain as many as they<br/>
deemed wisdom and to ^send^ them to all parts where they<br/>
could and then for the Twelve to return to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>In the weekly Despatch we read of the<br/>
wreck of the Packet Ship Garrick in which Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and</p>",
42828.0,343,,"<p>revokes it and commands something else then the Prophet is <br/>
considered a fallen Prophet""</p>

<p>""Because the Church will not receive chastisment <br/>
from the hand of the Prophet and Apostles the Lord chastises <br/>
us with sickness and death.""</p>

<p>""Let not any man publish his own righteousness <br/>
Others can do that for him. Rather let him confess his sins <br/>
and then he will be forgiven and bring forth more fruit.""</p>

<p>""The reason why we do not have more of the <br/>
secrets of the Lord revealled unto us is because we do not keep even <br/>
our own secrets but reveal them and make our difficulties known <br/>
even to our enemies""</p>

<p>""What greater love hath any man than that <br/>
he lay down his life for his friends. Then why not stand <br/>
by them unto death""</p>

<p>""These and many other matters [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
spoke and enlarged upon to our great edification</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] arose and said that <br/>
one thing rested with weight upon his mind—namely that we <br/>
ought to be prepared to keep each commandment as it came <br/>
from the mouth of the Prophet and as the Lord had commanded <br/>
us to build a Temple we should do it speedily</p>

<p><u>Christmas</u> <u>Day</u></p>

<p>On Christmas day the Twelve took supper by invitation <br/>
at M<sup>r</sup> [[Hiram Kimball|Hyrum Kimball]]s. It was excellent sleighing <br/>
and I got horses and sleigh and carried the wives of the <br/>
Twelve to our host's and home again after our party broke <br/>
up.</p>

<p>Our company consisted of Brigham <br/>
Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] <br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and myself and and our wives except Sister <br/>
[[Jennetta Richards Richards|Richards]] who was attending Sister [[Marinda Nancy Johnson Hyde|Hyde]]</p>

<p>We had an excellent feast and before we <br/>
left M<sup>r</sup> Kimball made each one of the Twelve a present<br/>
of a Lot of land and made out a bond for a deed to the whole <br/>
of the quorum. Each lot was worth 50 dollars making</p>",

purpose.</p>

<p>If a man obtains the fulness of the Gospel<br/>
he must get it in the same day that Jesus obtained it and<br/>
that was by keeping all the ordinances of the House of<br/>
the Lord.</p>

<p>Men will say I will never foresake you<br/>
but will stand by you at all times yet the moment you<br/>
teach them some of the mysteries of God that are retained<br/>
in the heavens and are to be revealed to the children of<br/>
men when they are prepared that moment they will be the<br/>
first to stone you and put you to death. It was upon<br/>
the same principle and the same spirit which crucified<br/>
the Lord Jesus Christ""</p>

<p>I will say something about the Spirits<br/>
in Prison. there has been much said upon the words<br/>
of Jesus to the ""Thief on the Cross"" saying ""This day thou<br/>
shalt be with me in Paradise.</p>

<p>The Comentators and Translators make<br/>
Jesus to say Paradise. But what is Par[adise]? It is<br/>
a modern word and does not answer at all to the original<br/>
which Jesus used. There is nothing in the original of any<br/>
language signifying Paradise. But it was ""This day I will<br/>
be with thee in the world of Spirits"" and will teach thee or<br/>
answer thy inquiries. The ""Theif on the Cross"" was to be<br/>
with Jesus Christ  in the world of Spirits. He did not say<br/>
Paradise or heaven.</p>

<p>The ^Refer^ doctrine of Baptism for the Dead<br/>
is clearly shown in the New Testament and if the doctrine<br/>
is not good then throw away the New Testament but if it<br/>
is the Word of God then let the doctrine be acknowledged<br/>
of God.</p>

<p>It was one of the reasons why Jesus said to the</p>",

<p>On the 7th we baptized Mrs [[Susanna Mehitable Rogers Sangiovanni Keate|Susanna<br/>
M. Sangiovanni]] at which I took great satisfaction<br/>
for she was the daughter of [[David White Rogers|David W. Rogers]] of<br/>
[[Montrose, Angus, Scotland|Montrose]]. She was married to an Italian who<br/>
was a very jealous man and an unbeleiver in the<br/>
Bible or any of the word of God and he would not<br/>
grant her any religious privileges. But this morning<br/>
she had come to be baptized and returned home rejoicing<br/>
with her whole heart. There was also one baptized<br/>
the day before.</p>

<p>This was Sunday and in the<br/>
afternoon we communed with the Saints experienced<br/>
a profitable time and had a full house and in<br/>
the evening Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] preached to a full<br/>
congregation and I followed him. The people paid<br/>
good attention and the Lord was with us greatly.</p>

<p>The Book of Mormon<br/>
Entered<br/>
At Stationers Hall.</p>

<p>We received on the 8th a package of 20 Books<br/>
of Mormon and two dozen Hymn Books and<br/>
Heber C Kimball and myself went to <strike>the</strike> [[Stationers|Stationers<br/>
Hall]] and secured the copyright of the Book of<br/>
Mormon in the name [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith Ju<sup>r</sup>]]. We <br/>
left five copies of the book and paid three shillings</p>

<p>In the evening we baptized<br/>
four persons one of whom was the [[Mary Ann Eacock Albon|wife]] of the Rev.<br/>
[[James Albon|James Albon]] who had already received the Gospel</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] per letter<br/>
informed us of the large imigration of that season<br/>
There were to go on one ship 235 and on another 100.</p>

<p>To the reader aquainted with the<br/>
immense emigrations of the Saints in later years<br/>

No 4 Block 10 in [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimballs]] addition to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Next day [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] called upon me and <br/>
others of the Twelve to attend meeting at his house in <br/>
the evening. Many good principles were presented by <br/>
Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] such as ""Speak not in tongues <br/>
to your own nation but to those of another nation <br/>
and then it would condem the unbeleiver; for the Lord <br/>
does not work in vain. Joseph spoke much on <br/>
the 14. ch of 1 Cor. upon prophesies ceasing.</p>

<p>The following day the Twelve spent <br/>
with Joseph the Seer and he unfolded to them many <br/>
glorious things at the Kingdom of God the privileges <br/>
and blessings of the Pristhood &amp;c. I had the <br/>
privilege for the first time of</p>

<p><u>Seeing the Urum Thummim</u></p>

<p>I spent the week as usual in my daily labours and <br/>
thus closed the year by my recording on the last <br/>
day in my Journal a synopsis of my travels &amp; <br/>
labours in the ministry during 1841</p>

that they might have attended to the ordinance of Baptism<br/>
for the Dead as well as other ordinances and for the<br/>
Priesthood and Revelations of God, &amp;c. This was the case<br/>
on the Day of Pentecost. The blessings were poured out<br/>
upon the disciples on that occasion</p>

<p>There has also been much said about<br/>
the word Hell and the sectarian world have preached<br/>
much about it. But what is hell? It is another<br/>
modern term and is taken from Hades, the Greek, or<br/>
Shaole, the Hebrew; and its true signification is a <br/>
world of spirits. Hades Shaole Paradise Spirits<br/>
in Prison is all one. It is a world of Spirits<br/>

world <u>of </u><u>Spirits</u></p>

<p>Says one I beleive in one Hell and one Heaven<br/>
All are equally miserable or equally happy. But St<br/>
[[Paul (NT)|Paul]] informs us of three glories and three heavens<br/>
He knew a man caught up to the third heavens and<br/>
Jesus said there were many mansions in his Father's<br/>
Kingdom.</p>

<p>Any man might beleive that Jesus<br/>
Christ is Godd and be happy in the beleif and yet not<br/>
obey his commandments.</p>

<p>A man of God should be endowed with<br/>
all wisdom knowledge and understanding in order to<br/>
teach and lead the people. The blind may lead the<br/>
blind and both fall into the ditch together.</p>

<p>There is much said concerning God<br/>
the Godhead &amp;c. The Scriptures say there are Gods<br/>
many and Lords many. The teachers of the day<br/>
say that the Father is God the Son is God and<br/>
the Holy Ghost is God and that they are all in one<br/>
person and are one God.</p>

<p>Jesus prayed that those whom the<br/>
Father had given him out of the world might be<br/>
""<u>one</u> <u>in</u> <u>us</u> <u>as</u> <u>we</u> <u>are</u> <u>one</u>""; but if they were to</p>",
42828.0,299,,"<p>the first sight seem a small notion. But this was in <br/>
the early rise of the European Mission and moreover in 1840 the<br/>
doctrine of emigration from father land among the English<br/>
was repugnant. Emigration had not then as now become an<br/>
institution of modern times. Out of this Church it was<br/>
considered among the peasantry and manifacturing classes<br/>
of [[England|England]] as a calamity and was never accepted by them<br/>
from choice. Not until misfortune panics in trade<br/>
or dire necessity came did they accept emigration from<br/>
father-land</p>

<p>At this time then came the Latter<br/>
day Saint Apostles and elders preaching to country<br/>
loving Englishman the doctrine of emigration from their<br/>
native land — and preaching the doctrine chiefly to those<br/>
who mostly perhaps had not seen a score of miles of the<br/>
great world outside their village, homes. Well might<br/>
we then in 1840 consider the emigration of four<br/>
hundred Saints as a large matter.</p>

<p>Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself at this time<br/>
prepared a tract for the press to present to the citizens<br/>
of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] before we left the first principles of the<br/>
Gospel and commission given by Jesus to his ancient<br/>
Apostles.</p>

<p>Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] arrived<br/>
in London on the 11th to take charge of the church<br/>
after our departure. I was truly glad to once more<br/>
greet him for I had not seen him since 1837</p>

<p>On the same day Elder [[William Hill Pitt|W<sup>m</sup> Pitt]]<br/>
also arrived at our lodgings and we had an interesting<br/>
meeting in the evening. Brother Snow preached<br/>
and Elder Kimball and myself followed him and<br/>
the next ^day^ brothers Heber and Lorenzo went to<br/>
[[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] to give impetous to the work of God<br/>
in that important town.</p>

<p>There was great excitement at that<br/>
time both in the House of Parliament and throughout<br/>
England in consequence of the apprehension and<br/>
imprisonment of Mr [[Alexander McLeod| M. C. Cleod]] a British officer</p>",

while in England I assisted with my quorum in</p>

42828.0,393,,"<p>be <strike>stuffed</strike> ^put^ into one person they would make a great God. If<br/>
I were to testify that the world was wrong on this point<br/>
it would be true. Peter says that Jesus sat on the right<br/>
hand of God and any person who has seen the heavens<br/>
opened knows that there are <u>three</u> <u>personages</u> in the Heavens<br/>
holding the keys of power.</p>

<p>""As the Father hath power in himself<br/>
so also hath the Son power in himself"". Then the Father<br/>
has at some time laid down his body and taken it again<br/>
so he has a body of his own. So has also his son.</p>

<p>Many of the Sects cry out I have the<br/>
testimony of Jesus. I have the Spirit of God; but away<br/>
with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Jo Smith]]. He says he is a Prophet but there is to<br/>
be no Prophets nor revelations in the last days. But<br/>
stop Sirs. The Revelator says, ""the testimony of Jesus<br/>
is the Spirit of prophecy,"" So by your own mouth you<br/>
are condemned.</p>

<p>But to the text. Why gather the people<br/>
together in this place? For the same reason that Jesus<br/>
wanted to gather the Jews to receive the ordinances the<br/>
blessings and the glories that God has in store for his<br/>
Saints.</p>

<p>And I will <strike>now</strike> ^here^ ask this Assembly and<br/>
all the Saints if they will <strike>now</strike> build this house and<br/>
receive the ordinances and blessings which God has in<br/>
store for you or will you not build unto the Lord<br/>
this House and let Him pass by and bestow these<br/>
blessings upon another. I pause for a reply.</p>

<p>About this time in company with several others<br/>
I started to fence and plant a five acre lot of prairie<br/>
We had not got far before the reach of our wagon<br/>
broke and we were all thrown into a pile together<br/>
and the wheel went on my arm and bruised it<br/>
considerably. But we mended up and continued</p>",
42828.0,300,,"<p>in [[Lockport, Niagara County, New York|Lockport]] Jail by the State of [[New York|New York]] which was<br/>
trying him for arson and murder, and the Americans<br/>
were determined to execute him if found guilty.</p>

<p>The accusation was the burning of<br/>
the Caroline on [[Lake Erie, United States|Lake Erie]] in 1834 during the troubles<br/>
in [[Canada|Canada]]. [[England|England]] considered it a national and<br/>
not an individual affair and that [[Alexander McLeod|M. C. Cleod]] acted<br/>
by order of the British Government and not upon his<br/>
own responsibility. Under these considerations<br/>
Parliament was determined to demand his release <br/>
and defend his life even at the expence of immediate<br/>
war with America. Government had sent a <br/>
special message and instructions to the British<br/>
ambassador at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]. These threatenings<br/>
of war between [[England|England]] and America made <br/>
us anxious concerning our return to our country<br/>
and the emigration of the Saints to the body<br/>
of the Church.</p>

<p>From what I had seen of<br/>
England of one thing I felt certain and that was<br/>
that if America hazards a war with England<br/>
she would find it to be more than a joke to<br/>
meet so strong a foe and one armed to the teeth<br/>
for war. Upon the subject I thought and<br/>
wrote in my daily journal:</p>

<p>""Should Truth speak she would<br/>
represent England at the present time as the strongest<br/>
among the nations and chief in power and main spring<br/>
of the Gentile world. She will remain her season<br/>
as an instrument in the hand of God to bring<br/>
about great events, in the restoration of the Jews and<br/>
to be a scourge to the nations America not excepted<br/>
but she will also receive the scourage and the chastening<br/>
hand of the Almighty will fall upon her in turn<br/>
But O! America, America! ^whose had is^ choice above all other<br/>
lands and ^thou^ established by omnipotant Power! thy<br/>
salt hath lost it savour thy light hath gone<br/>
out and thine Eagle's crest is stained with the blood</p>",

<p>Chapter XIX</p>

<p>New Year's day 1842 found me in <br/>
the city of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with the quorum of the Twelve and <br/>
our wives spending the day at the house of brother <br/>
[[Sylvester B. Stoddard|Stodard]].</p>

<p>It was an interesting occassion for <br/>
us to meet together with our families at a festive <br/>
time in the city of the Saints in the midst of peace <br/>
and love. We could the more highly prize this privilege <br/>
as we were so often called to be seperated in the vineyard <br/>
of the Lord</p>

<p>It was now my privilege and lot to <br/>
tarry for a season at home, and to provide for my family <br/>
This was the first time since I had been in the Church <br/>
that I had been thus privileged as I had been on missions most <br/>
of the time for eight years</p>

<p>As we had now the commandment <br/>
of the Lord to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo <br/>
house]] resting upon us the probability was that the Quorum <br/>
of the Twelve would spend most of the time in Nauvoo <br/>
until the Temple was built.</p>

<p>On the 10th of the month I sold to <br/>
brother [[John Horlick|John Horlick]] the South half of my lot and bought <br/>
two lots of [[Hiram Kimball|Hyrum Kimball]] for $250 fifty of which <br/>
I paid him down in cloth and a watch and the other</p>",
42828.0,394,,"<p>to the prairie and made 82 rods of worm fence with<br/>
stakes and riders. Just before I left I went to brother<br/>
Cheney to get a drink of water and his dog bit me<br/>
very badly through the calf of my left. He was<br/>
an ugly dog and had bit several persons before<br/>
I was very lame for some days and the next time<br/>
I went to my lot I informed Brother [[Elijah Cheney|Cheney]] that<br/>
I should not be satisfied unless he killed his dog<br/>
as he was dangerous and in the habit of biting<br/>
persons.</p>

<p>Judge [[James Adams|Adams]] of [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] wrote<br/>
informing us that the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Governor]] of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
had made another demand for [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] at the <br/>
hands of the [[Thomas Ford|Governor]] of [[Illinois|Illinois]] and that Ford<br/>
of Illinois had issued the write for his apprehension.</p>

<p>Two messengers were immediately<br/>
despatched from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to President Joseph<br/>
Smith, who was absent <strike>&amp;</strike> ^about^ 200 miles from home<br/>
at the time, informing him of these facts.</p>

<p>This was on the Sunday. <strike>and</strike><br/>
The <strike>Sabath</strike> following <strike>being</strike> ^day^ June 25th in the afternoon<br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] came into the Stand and requested the<br/>
Masonic Fraternity to meet him in the [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Lodge Room]]<br/>
in a half an hour. We immediately went down<br/>
but a quarter of us could not get into the room.</p>

<p><strike>This being the case</strike> We formed<br/>
a hollow square on the green. Hyrum then<br/>
informed us that the [[Thomas Reynolds|Sheriff]] of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson Co.]] Missouri<br/>
and [[Harmon Theodore Wilson|Wilson]] of [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] had come upon Joseph<br/>
and taken him by surprise presenting each of<br/>
them a pistol to his breast and swaring they<br/>
would kill him if he made any resistance.</p>

<p>Brother [[Stephen Markham|Markham]] went to his<br/>
assistance and they presented pistols to him<br/>
also and threatened his life. He approached<br/>
them however to knock down the pistols when<br/>
they again pointed them at Joseph's breast</p>",
42828.0,347,,"<p>was to be paid in two annual payments; and a week or two <br/>
afterwards I purchased a house and an acre of land of brother <br/>
[[William Parsons|Parsons]] to be paid for on the 20th of the following April</p>

<p>Several days later I rode to Brother <br/>
[[John Benbow|Benbow]]s on the Pra<strike>r</strike>^i^rie six miles from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and it being <br/>
Sunday I preached at his house</p>

<p>This was the first time that I had visited <br/>
him since my return to Nauvoo. I spent the time very <br/>
pleasantly while there. His farm looked almost like the <br/>
Garden of Eden. I never had seen more work done in one <br/>
year on a pra<strike>r</strike>^i^rie farm than on his. He had surrounded <br/>
it and crossed it with heavy ditches and planted thorn hedges <br/>
His dwelling barns sheds garden yards orchards &amp;c were all <br/>
beautifully arranged. <strike>Indeed</strike> Brother Benbow's farm much <br/>
resembled the farms of old [[England|England]] where as the reader has <br/>
learned he held the position of a respectable well-to-do-farmer,<br/>
who cultivated about 300 acres of land</p>

<p>This place was a pleasant retreat for a <br/>
Summers ride from Nauvoo. The little neighbourhood <br/>
consisted of five families from England and all well united <br/>
excepting one family who had denyed the faith.</p>

<p>Before my return to the city on the <br/>
following day I paid to brother John Benbow 200 dollars <br/>
for President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and endorsed it on his note</p>

<p>I assisted in drawing up from the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] <br/>
two large stones to the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo house]] for the threshholds <br/>
of the doors</p>

<p>A few days previous a revelation <br/>
was given for the Twelve to obtain the printing establishment <br/>
of [[Ebenezer Robinson|E. Robinson]] and govern the printing of the Times &amp; <br/>
Seasons and all the publication of the Church as directed by <br/>
the Holy Ghost</p>

<p>After consulting upon the subject the <br/>
quorum of the Twelve appointed Elders [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and <br/>
Willford Woodruff to take charge of the whole establishment <br/>
and edit the Times and Seasons under the direction <br/>
of Joesph the Seer</p>

<p>Accordingly on the 3rd of February <strike>3rd</strike> I</p>",
42828.0,395,,"<p>and said they would kill <u>him</u> [[Stephen Markham|Markham]] if approached<br/>
them. So to save [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] life Marham forbare<br/>
and they then took Joseph into [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] and started for<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]].</p>

<p>They had gone about ten miles when they<br/>
were stoped by the inhabitants of the country who<br/>
swore they should not carry Joseph Smith any farther<br/>
without giving him a chance of the law and they<br/>
took out a writ of Habeas Corpus in behalf of Joseph and<br/>
a writ against Sheriffs [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] and [[Harmon Theodore Wilson|Wilson]] and they<br/>
now wanted a company to go to Joseph to see that he<br/>
had his rights.</p>

<p>Brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] called for volunteers<br/>
and the whole city flocked together. They made choice<br/>
of such as they wished and Generals [[William Law|Law]] and<br/>
[[Charles Coulson Rich|Rich]] went with about one hundred men on horseback<br/>
and somewhere near the same on board the Maid<br/>
of Iowa. The horsemen left the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|City]] at about<br/>
8 o'clock that night but the boat did not start<br/>
until the next morning.</p>

<p><u>Triumphal Entry of the Prophet</u><br/>

<u>The City of Nauvoo</u></p>

<p>Five days afterwards at 1 o'clock in the afternoon<br/>
the citizens of Nauvoo, went out in great numbers<br/>
on foot horseback and in carriages to meet the Prophet<br/>
and when they did meet him there was a scene<br/>
of great joy</p>

<p>A band of music and a great<br/>
multitude escorted him to his home and Reynolds<br/>
of Missouri and Wilson of Carthage who had taken <br/>
him by force of arms were brought to Nauvoo<br/>
with ^him^ and they looked as though they had the ague<br/>
Yet Joseph heaped coals of fire upon their heads who<br/>
had so inhumanly treated him by taking them to</p>",
42828.0,348,,"<p>left my station at the [[Nauvoo Provision Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo Provision Store]] and commenced <br/>
to labour for the Church in the Printing Establishment. Elder <br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] and myself spent the afternoon in taking an invoice <br/>
of the [[Nauvoo Printing Office, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Printing Office]] which we finished the next day and met <br/>
at [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] [[Red Brick Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Store]] and [[Ebenezer Robinson|E Robinson]] made out the deed to [[Willard Richards|Willard<br/>
Richards]] of his lot and house containing the Printing establishment <br/>
and all appurtenances belonging thereto amounting in <br/>
all to $6,600.</p>

<p>The following day I assisted Willard Richards <br/>
in taking in the tithing for the ^[[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]^ amounting to about <br/>
1000 dollars worth of property</p>

<p>About two weeks later Joseph the Seer <br/>
presented us with some of the Book of Abraham written <br/>
by the hand of that Patriarch and which was found <br/>
in [[Egypt|Egypt]] and ^<strike>which</strike>^ with some mummies came into the <br/>
hands of the Prophet several years before. He was <br/>
now translating them to publish portions of it in <br/>
the Times and Seasons of which paper he was the <br/>
Editor and John Taylor his assistant while the business <br/>
part of the establishment was under my charge</p>

<p>I had been much edified of late in <br/>
hearing Joseph converse upon the mystries of the Kingdom <br/>
of God. ""Truly,"" I thought, ""the Lord is with him and <br/>
making him mighty in Knowledge and wisdom"" and I was <br/>
convinced that none of the Prophets or Seers have ever accomplished <br/>
a greater work than the Lord will bring to pass in the last <br/>
days through the instrumentality of Joseph</p>

<p>On My birthday ^March 1st^ <strike>came and</strike> I made a feast <br/>
for my friends and four days afterwards, on the 4th of <br/>
March in the morning, 30 minutes past 10 ^o'clock^ a.m. my daughter <br/>
[[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe A. Woodruff]] was born</p>

<p>A week later the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Legion met <br/>
on parade and in company with the Twelve I rode in the <br/>
Legion as assistant Chaplain. This was the first time I <br/>
had seen the Legion on parade</p>

<p>On the 15th of the ^same^ month the [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo <br/>
Masonic Lodge]] was established and organized. The <br/>
procession was found at half past one oclock at Joseph's</p>",
42828.0,396,,"<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|his]] house setting them at the head of his table and<br/>
causing the best his house afforded to be served to them<br/>
by his [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|wife]] — the very woman they had refused to<br/>
see her husband when they forced him with the<br/>
threatening of arms and ruffian oaths.</p>

<p>After dinner they all repaired<br/>
to the Court Room and Joseph was delivered into the<br/>
hands of the Municipal Court for trial.</p>

<p>Before he went into court Joseph<br/>
mounted a wagon and said to the multitude —</p>

<p>""I am out of the hands of the Missourians<br/>
thank God!""</p>

<p>He thanked them for their kindness and<br/>
love to him and said that he would address them at<br/>
the grove near the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] at 4 o'clock</p>

<p>After the case was introduced to the<br/>
Court Joseph informed it that he had an appointment<br/>
to address the citizens and ask^ed^ the privilege. The<br/>
court extended the courtesy to him and <strike>he went</strike> ^the^<br/>
^court^ adjourned until the next morning.</p>

<p>After the adjournment of his case<br/>
Joseph went to the Grove and took the Stand<br/>
in the presence of an assembly of about seven<br/>
thousand Saints ^to whom he narrated the incidents of<br/>
his arrest and maintained the prowers of the Charter of Nauvoo for<br/>
the protection of its citizens.^</p>

<p>I require attention. I discovered what the emotions<br/>
of the people were on my arrival to this city and I<br/>
have come here to say How do you do? to all parties<br/>
and I now say How do you do at this time</p>

[FIGURE] [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Lodge]] was organized and an address delivered by the Grand Master <br/>
of the Masonic Lodge of Illinois. There were about three thousand <br/>
assembled on the occasion [FIGURE]</p>

<p>On Sunday March the 20th a large assembly <br/>
gathered at an early hour to hear a discourse from [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
upon the subject of baptism, but as a young child wsa dead <br/>
and his corps brougt in the assembly it called forth many <br/>
remarks upon death and the resurrection. I reported and recorded <br/>
in my Journal</p>

<p>A Brief Synopsis <br/>
of the <br/>
Sermon of Joseph the Prophet</p>

<p>The speaker read the 14 ch of Revelations and said:</p>

<p>""We have again the warning voice Sounded in our midst <br/>
""which shows the uncertainty of human life. And in my <br/>
""leasure moments I have meditated upon the subject and <br/>
asked the question, Why is it that inocent children are taken<br/>
away from us especially those who seem to be the most <br/>
intelligent beings?""</p>

<p>The Answer: [FIGURE]</p>

<p>""This world is a very wicked world and it is <br/>
a proverb that it grows weaker and wiser, but if this is the <br/>
case it is also true that the world grows more wicked and <br/>
corrupt</p>

<p>""In the early ages of the world a righteous <br/>
man—a man of God and intelligence had a better chance <br/>
to do good, to be received and beleived than at the present <br/>
day. In these days such a man is much opposed <br/>
and persecuted by most of the inhabitants of the earth <br/>
and he has much sorrow to pass through. Hence the <br/>
Lord takes many away even in infancy that they may escape <br/>
the envy of man and the sorrows and evils of the present <br/>
^and they were too true and too lovely to live on earth^ world. Therefore I rightly considered instead of mourning <br/>
we have reason to rejoice as they are delivered from the <br/>
evil and we shall soon have them again.</p>",
42828.0,397,,"<p>gratitude to Almighty God and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] presume you all feel the<br/>
same.</p>

<p>I hardly know how to express my feelings.<br/>
I feel as strong as a giant. I pulled sticks with the<br/>
men coming along and with one hand I pulled up<br/>
the strongest man there was on the road <strike>with one</strike><br/>
<strike>hand</strike> and two could not pull me up; and I continued<br/>
to pull until I pulled them to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. but I will<br/>
pass from that subject.</p>

<p>There has been great excitement in<br/>
the country but since those men took me I have<br/>
been cool and dispassionate through the whole.</p>

<p>Thank God I am now in the hands<br/>
of the Municipal Court of Nauvoo and not in the hands<br/>
of Missourians.</p>

<p>It has been discussed by the great<br/>
and wise men—lawyers and there like: Oh your<br/>
powers and legal tribunals are not to be sanctioned<br/>
and so we will make it lawful to drag away inorent<br/>
men from their families and friends and have them<br/>
unlawfully put to death by ungodly men for their<br/>
religion.</p>

<p>Relative to our charter, courts, right<br/>
of Habeaus Corpus &amp;c we have all power; and if<br/>
any man from this time fourth says anything<br/>
contrary cast it into his teeth.</p>

<p>There is a secret in this. If there<br/>
is not power in our Charter and Courts then there<br/>
is not power in the State of [[Illinois|Illinois]] nor in the<br/>
Congress nor Constitution of the United States; for<br/>
the United States gave unto Illinois her constitution<br/>
and charter; and Illionois gave unto Nauvoo <u>her</u><br/>
charter which have ceded unto us our vested<br/>
rights and she has no right nor power to take<br/>
them from us. All the power there was in<br/>
Illinois she gave to Nauvoo and any man who<br/>
says to the contrary is a fool.</p>

<p>I want you to <strike>teach</strike> ^learn^, O! Israel, what</p>",
42828.0,350,,"<p>""What chance is there for infidelity when we are <br/>
""parting from our friends daily? There is none at all. <br/>
""The infidel will grasp at every straw for help until <br/>
""death stares him in the face and then his infidelity takes <br/>
""its flight; for the realities of the eternal world are <br/>
""resting in mighty power upon him. When every earthly <br/>
""support and prop fails him he then sensibly feels the <br/>
""eternal truths of the immortality of the soul.</p>

<p>""Concerning the doctrine of baptizing or sprinkling <br/>
""children or they must welter in hell the doctrine is <br/>
""not true nor supported in Holy Writ and it is not <br/>
""consistant with the character of God""</p>

<p>""The moment children leave this world <br/>
""they are taken into Abraham's bosom. The only <br/>
difference between the old and young dying is that <br/>
one lives longer in heaven and eternal light and glory <br/>
them the other and was freed a little sooner from <br/>
this misserable wicked world. Notwithstanding <br/>
all this glory we for a moment loose sight of it <br/>
and mourn the loss but we mourn not as those <br/>
without hope.""</p>

<p>We should take warning and not <br/>
wait for the death bed to repent. As we see the <br/>
infant taken away by death so may the youth and <br/>
middle aged as well be called suddenly into eternity <br/>
Let this then prove as a warning to all not to <br/>
procrastinate repentance nor wait till a death bed comes <br/>
for it is the will of God that man should repent and <br/>
serve Him in health and strength and in the power of <br/>
his mind in order to secure his blessing and ^not^ to wait <br/>
until he is called to die.""</p>

<p>""My intention was to have treated <br/>
upon the subject of baptism; but having a case of <br/>
death before us I thought it proper to refer to that <br/>
subject. I will now however say a few words upon <br/>
baptism as designed.</p>

<p>""God has made certain decrees which</p>",
42828.0,398,,"<p>what is for the happiness and peace of this [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]] and<br/>
people for our enemies are determined to oppress us<br/>
and deprive us of our rights and privileges as they<br/>
have alone; If the authorities that be on the<br/>
earth will not assist us in our rights nor give<br/>
us that protection which the laws and constitution<br/>
of the United States and of this. State guarantee<br/>
unto us then we will claim them from Higher<br/>
Power — from Heaven — from God Almighty for<br/>
our constitutional rights.</p>

<p><strike>I swear</strike> [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will not deal so mildly<br/>
with them again for the time has come when<br/>
forbearance is no longer a virtue; and if you are<br/>
again taken unlawfully you are not liberty to give<br/>
loose to blook and thunder but act with<br/>
Almighty power.</p>

<p>But good luck to me as it<br/>
always has been in every time of trouble, friends<br/>
though they were strangers were raise up to me<br/>
and assisted me. The time has come when<br/>
the veil is torn off the people of the State of [[Illinois|Illinois]]<br/>
and they have delivered me from the State of<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]]. The friends who were raised up<br/>
unto me would have spilt their blood for me<br/>
to have delivered me then and there but I told<br/>
them not for I should be delivered by the power<br/>
of God and Generalship.</p>

<p>I have brought the men who<br/>
arrested me to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and treated them kindly. I<br/>
have had the privilege of rewarding them good for<br/>
evil. They took me unlawfully, treated me rigorously,<br/>
strove to deprive me of my rights and would have<br/>
run me into Missouri to have been murdered<br/>
had not Providence interposed; but now they<br/>
are in my hands. I took them into my house<br/>
set them at the head of the table and placed the<br/>
best before them my house afforded and they were<br/>
waited upon by my [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|wife]] whom they deprived of</p>",

<p>I shall be discharged <strike>before</strike> ^by the^ Municipal<br/>

I should be discharged; but before I will bear this un-<br/>
hallowed persecution any longer I will spill my blood<br/>
There is a time when bearing it any longer is a sin<br/>
I will not bear it longer. I will spill the last drop<br/>
of blood I have; and all who will not bear it<br/>
longer say, Aye! -[<u>The</u> <u>cry</u> <u>of</u> <u>Aye</u> <u>rung</u> <u>throughout</u><br/>
<u>the</u> <u>congregation</u>]-</p>

<p>""We must stop paying the lawyers<br/>
money; for I have learned that they dont know<br/>
anything. I know more than they all.</p>

<p>Whosoever beleiveth that there is<br/>
power in the charter of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] shall be saved:<br/>
he that beleiveth not shall not come here.</p>

<p>If a lawyer shall say there<br/>
is more power in other places and charters than<br/>
in Nauvoo beleive it not.</p>

<p>^I supose^ I have converted this candidate <br/>
for congress, Mr. [[Cyrus Walker|Walker]]. <strike>I suppose w</strike>When I<br/>
see him converted I shall vote for him; and<br/>
not before. I have been with these lawyers and<br/>
they have treated me well; but I am here in<br/>
Nauvoo and the Missourian.</p>

<p>However you may feel about the high<br/>
hand of oppression I wish you to restrain your hand<br/>
from violence against those men who arrested<br/>
me. My word is at stake. A hair of their<br/>
heads shall not be harmed.</p>

<p>My life is pledged to carry out<br/>
this great work. I know how readily you are to<br/>
do right. You have done great things and manifested<br/>
your love in flying to my assistance on this occasion.<br/>
I could not have done better myself; and I bless<br/>
you in the name of the Lord <strike>with all the blessings</strike></p>",
42828.0,400,,"<p>May you not have to suffer as you have suffered<br/>
heretofore. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] know the Almighty will bless<br/>
all good men. He will bless you; and the time<br/>
has come when there shall be such a flocking<br/>
to the Standard of Liberty as never has been and<br/>
never shall be hereafter. What an era has<br/>
commenced? Shall the prophecies be established<br/>
by the sword? Shall we always bear? No!<br/>
Will not the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]] stay her hand<br/>
in her unhallowed persecutions against the Saints?<br/>
If she will not I restrain you not any longer.</p>

<p>I say in the name of Jesus<br/>
Christ I this day turn the key that opens the<br/>
Heavens to restrain you no longer from this time<br/>
forth. I will lead you to battle and if you are<br/>
not of<strike>f</strike> raid to die and feel disposed to spill your<br/>
blood in your own defence you will not offend me.</p>

<p>Be not the agressor. Bear until<br/>
they strike on the one cheek. Offer the other and<br/>
they will be sure to strike that also. Then defend<br/>
yourself and God shall bear you off!</p>

<p>Will any part of [[Illinois|Illinois]] say we<br/>
shall not have our rights? Treat such as strangers<br/>
and not friends and let them go to hell. Say some<br/>
we will mob you. Mob and be damned. If<br/>
I am under the necessity of giving up our chartered<br/>
rights privileges and freedom for which our fathers<br/>
fought and blead and which the Constitution of the<br/>
United States and this State guarantee to us I<br/>
will do it at the point of the bayonet and sword.</p>

<p>Many lawyers contend for that<br/>
which is against the rights of man; and I can<br/>
only excuse them because of their ignorance.</p>

<p>Go forth and advocate the rights of<br/>
the people ye lawyers. If you do not dont<br/>
get into my hands nor under the lash of my<br/>
tongue. The lawyers say the powers of<br/>
the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Charter are dangerous. But I</p>",
42828.0,401,,"<p>ask is the constitution of the United State or if this State <br/>
dangerous? No. Neither are the charters granted <br/>
unto [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] by the Legislature of [[Illinois|Illinois]] and those <br/>
who say they are, are fools.</p>

<p>We have not our rights. Those which <br/>
the Constitution of the United States grant and which <br/>
our charters grant we have not enjoyed unmolested.<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] and all wicked men will raise the Hue <br/>
and Cry against us and are not satisfied. But what <br/>
are they going to do to help them selves? What will <br/>
mobocrats do in the midst of this people. If mobs <br/>
come upon you any more here dung your gardens <br/>
with them. But says one you will get up excitement. <br/>
We will get up no excitement except what we can <br/>
find and escape from. We will rise up [[George Washington|Washington]]-<br/>
like and break off the w<strike>h</strike>eight which bears us down <br/>
and we <u>will</u> <u>not</u> <u>be</u> mobbed.</p>

<p>To give you an account of my journey <br/>
I will tell you an anecdote which may be pleasing</p>

<p>A day before I was taken I rode <br/>
with my [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|wife]] through a neighbourhood to visit some <br/>
friends; and I said to Mrs Smith, ""Here are a <br/>
good people"". I felt this by the Spirit of God. <br/>
The next day I was in their <strike>hands</strike> ^midst^ a prisoner ^and^ <br/>
<strike>with</strike>^they stood by me^ [[Abel B. Wilson|Wilson]] <strike>who</strike> said as he drove up, ""Ha! ha! ha!<br/>
By God we have got the Prophet!"" He gloried <br/>
much in it but he is now our prisoner.</p>

<p>When [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] of Missouri and <br/>
Wilson of [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] came to take me ^instead^ <br/>
^of tapping^ me on the shoulder and saying <br/>
""You are my prisoner"" with two cocked pistols at <br/>
my head their first salutation was ""God damn <br/>
you I will shoot you! I will shoot you. God <br/>
damn you I will shoot you!""</p>

<p>This they did nearly fifty ^tines^ first <br/>
and <strike>at</strike> last, I asked them what the wanted to shoot <br/>
me for. </p>",
42828.0,402,,"<p>""If you make any resistance.""</p>

<p>""Oh! very well said I. I have no resistance <br/>
to make.""</p>

<p>They then draged me away; and while <br/>
on the road I asked them by what authority they did <br/>
they these things:</p>

<p>They said, ""By a writ from the <br/>
Government of [[Missouri|Missouri]] and [[Illinois|Illinois]]""</p>

<p>I then told them I wanted a Writ of Habaeus <br/>
Corpus. The reply was,</p>

<p>""God damn you! You shant have it.""</p>

<p>I told a man to go to [[Dixon, Lee County, Illinois|Dixon]] and <br/>
get me a Writ of Habaeus Corpus. [[Abel B. Wilson|Wilson]] answered</p>

<p>""God damn you! You shat have it. I <br/>
will shoot you!""</p>

<p>I sent for a lawyer to come. One <br/>
came; and [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] shut the door in his face and <br/>
would not let me speak to him and said again <br/>
""God damn you! I will shoot you!""</p>

<p>I turned to him opened my bosom <br/>
and told him to shoot away and I did ^it^ frequently.</p>

<p>I told Mr Reynolds that I <u>would</u> <br/>
have council to speak to; and the lawyers came <br/>
to me and I got a Writ of Habaeus Corpus for <br/>
myself and a writ against Wilson and Reynolds <br/>
for unlawful proceedings towards me and cruel <br/>
treatment.</p>

<p>They could not get out of town that <br/>
night. I pledged my honour to my Council that the <br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Charter had power to investigate the subject <br/>
and we came to Nauvoo by common consent and I am <br/>
now a prisoner of higher authority. Yes higher authority: <br/>
before yourselves</p>

<p>The Charter expressly say that <br/>
the City Council shall have power to enact all laws <br/>
for the benefit and convenience of said city not <br/>
contrary to the constitutions of the United States <br/>
and that of this State; and also says the Municipal </p>",
42828.0,403,,"<p>Court shall have power to grant Writ of Habeaus Corpus <br/>
in all cases arising under the ordinances of the City Council</p>

<p>There is nothing but what we have <br/>
power over except ^that^ restricted by the Constitution of the <br/>
United States or of this State. This is in accordance <br/>
with the Constitution of the United States</p>

<p>But says the mob ""What dangerous powers!""</p>

<p>But the Constitution of the United States is not <br/>
dangerous against good men neither is that of this State<br/>
but to bad men—the breakers of the law</p>

<p>As with the laws of the country so <br/>
with the ordinances of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. They are dangerous to <br/>
mobs but not to good men who wish to keep the law</p>

<p>We do not go out of Nauvoo to disturb <br/>
anybody nor any city town or place. Why need they <br/>
be troubled about us? Let them not meddle with our <br/>
affairs but let us alone.</p>

<p>After we have been deprived of our <br/>
rights and privileges as citisens,—driven from town to <br/>
town place to place and State to State, with the <br/>
sacrifice of our homes and lands,—our blood shed <br/>
and many murdered and all this because of our <br/>
religion—because we worship Almighty God according <br/>
to the dictates of our own conscience, shall we <br/>
longer bear these cruelties which have been heaped <br/>
upon us for the last ten years in the face of <br/>
heaven and in open violation of the Constitution and <br/>
laws of the United State and of this State?<br/>
May God forbid! I will not bear it. If they <br/>
take away my rights I will fight for my rights <br/>
I will fight for my rights manfully until I am <br/>
used up with blood and thunder sword and pistol.</p>

<p>We have done nothing against law<br/>
and right. As touching our City Charter and laws <br/>
there is a secret. What is it? Our laws go behind <br/>
the writ and investigate the subject <strike>ie</strike> ^that is to say^ of Habeaus <br/>
Corpus while other laws do not go behind the writ</p>

<p>You speak of lawyers. I am a </p>",
42828.0,404,,"<p>too; but the Almighty God has taught me the principle <br/>
of law; and the true meaning of the Writ of Habeaus <br/>
Corpus is to defend the inocent and investigate the subject— <br/>
go behind the writ and even if the form of the writ <br/>
should be right but issued against an inocent man <br/>
he should not be dragged to another State and there <br/>
put to death or in jeap[ardy] of life or limb because of<br/>
prejudice when he is inocent.</p>

<p>The benefits of the Constitution and <br/>
law is for all alike and the great Eloihiem <strike>or</strike> <strike>God</strike> has given <br/>
me the privilege of having the benefits of a<strike>n</strike>f the Constitution <br/>
and writ of Habeaus Corpus. I am bold to ask <br/>
for this privilege this day and to ask  you to carry <br/>
out this principle and all who are in favour of this <br/>
great principle make it manifest by raising the <br/>
right hand.""</p>

<p>—[The^re^ was a perfect sea of hands—a <br/>
universal vote. It was truly a committee of the <br/>
whole. After this strong demonstration of the feelings <br/>
of the vast multitude present Joseph continued]—</p>

<p>""In speaking of my journey to <br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] I will relate a circumstance.</p>

<p>""When Mr [[Cyrus Walker|Cyrus Walker]] came <br/>
to me they said I should not speak to any man <br/>
and they would shoot any man who should speak <br/>
to me. An old man came up and said I <br/>
should have council and <strike>said</strike>^told them^ he was not affraid of <br/>
their pistols. <strike>I was delivered from them</strike></p>

<p>My freedom commenced from the time the <br/>
old man came to me and would talk to me. We <br/>
came direct from Papa Grove to Nauvoo. Our writ <br/>
was directed to the nearest court having authority to <br/>
try the case and we came to Nauvoo</p>",
42828.0,405,,"<p>It did my soul good to see your feelings and love manifested <br/>
towards me I thank God that I have the honour to lead <br/>
so virtuous and honest a people—to be your leader and <br/>
law<strike>yer</strike>^giver^ ^ver^ as [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] was to the children of [[Israel|Israel]]. Hosannah! <br/>
Hosannah! Hosannah to the name of the Most High <br/>
God. I commend you to His grace and may the <br/>
blessings of heaven rest upon you in the name of Jesus <br/>
Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>Furthermore if [[Missouri|Missouri]] continues her <br/>
warfare and continues to issue writs against me and <br/>
this people unlawfully and unjustly as <strike>they </strike> ^it^ <strike>have</strike> ^has^ done <br/>
and our rights are trampled upon and taken away <br/>
I sware with uplifted hands towards heaven I <br/>
will spill my blood in the defence. They shall not <br/>
take away our rights and if they do not stop leading <br/>
me by the nose I will lead them by the nose and <br/>
if they do not let me alone I will turn  up the <br/>
world. I will make war! When we shake <br/>
our own bushes we want to catch our own fruit</p>

<p>The lawyers themselves acknowledge <br/>
that we have all power granted us in our charters <br/>
that we could ask for—that we had more power <br/>
than any other court in the State for all other <br/>
courts were restricted while ours was not and <br/>
I thank God Almighty for it and I will not <br/>
be rode down to hell by the Missourians any <br/>
longer and it is my privilege to speak <br/>
in my own defence and appeal to your <br/>
Honors.</p>

<p>Next day July the 1st the case of <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] came before the Municipal <br/>
Court of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum <br/>
Smith]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and <br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] were called upon as witnesses </p>",
42828.0,406,,"<p>and duly Sworn.</p>

<p>The testimony of these witnesses occupied <br/>
nearly the entire day. They recountered the whole history <br/>
of the persecution from [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] to the time of <br/>
their expulsion from the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]] by force of <br/>
arms.</p>

<p>It was heart-rending to hear the rehersal <br/>
Never was <strike>g</strike>there given to any tribunal a history of <br/>
barbarities and religious persecution more disgraceful <br/>
to civilization for it was in the Nineteenth century <br/>
and in America. Yet that tribunal heard that <br/>
day a history of persecution in many atrocious forms <br/>
among which were the scenes of prisons chains rape <br/>
murder and expulsion and heard the horrible fact <br/>
that when [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his companions were in prison <br/>
loaded with chains they were <u>fed</u> <u>with</u> <u>nothing</u> <u>for</u><br/>
<u>five</u> <u>days</u> in succession but the <u>flesh</u> <u>of</u> <u>their</u> <u>own</u> <br/>
^<u>murdered</u>^ <u>Brethren</u> which was actually <u>cooked</u> <u>and</u> <u>given</u> <br/>
<u>them</u> <u>to</u> <u>eat</u>. This horrible fact they afterwards <br/>
discovered from the exultation of the monsters who <br/>
who the cause of this fiendish circumstance.</p>

<p>While hearing this part of <br/>
the testimony my blood boiled within me and the <br/>
spirit of war was aroused The Gentile Lawyers <br/>
who had the management of the case were shocked <br/>
to the soul and Mr [[Cyrus Walker|Wallker]] and the three other <br/>
legal gentlemen each made a speech coun<strike>c</strike>selling <br/>
us to stand for our rights at any issue.</p>

<p>The 4th of July was a great and <br/>
happy day with us in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. Joseph had just <br/>
been again delivered from the hands of Missouri <br/>
and it was also the day of our National Indipendence</p>

<p>At a very early hour people began <br/>
to assemble at the Grove and at eleven o'clock there were <br/>
congregated something near the number of 13,000 persons <br/>
and the constant accession of others swelled the <br/>
congregation to fifteen thousand persons as near as <br/>
could be estimated</p>",
42828.0,407,,"<p>In the forenoon this vast multitude was addressed <br/>
by [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] who had lately returned from [[Palestine|Palestine]] and <br/>
^who^ was now under a new appointment, to go on a mission to <br/>
St Petersburgh Russia.</p>

<p>In the afternoon three Steamers arrived <br/>
one from [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis]] one from [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] and the other from <br/>
[[Burlington, Kane County, Illinois|Burlington]] bringing altogether about nine hundred visiting <br/>
ladies and gentlemen to our [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]].</p>

<p>On the arrival of each boat the visitors <br/>
were escorted to the Stand by the Nauvoo Band where <br/>
they were welcomed by the firing of cannon and provided <br/>
with seats.</p>

<p>During the afternoon [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>
gave a masterly discourse and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] followed him <br/>
upon the subject of his arrest &amp;c</p>

<p><u>Synopsis</u><br/>
<u>of</u><br/>
<u>The</u> <u>Defence</u> <u>of</u> <u>Joseph</u></p>

<p><u>Before</u> <u>Fifeteen</u> <u>Thousand</u> <u>People.</u></p>

<p>If the people will give ear a moment I will <br/>
address them a few words in my own defence as <br/>
touching my arrest</p>

<p>In the first place I will state to <br/>
those who can hear me that I never spent more than <br/>
six months in [[Missouri|Missouri]] except while in prison <br/>
While I was there I was at work for the support of <br/>
my family. I never was a prisoner of war <br/>
during my stay there for I had not made war. I <br/>
never took a pistol a gun or a sword and the much <br/>
which has been said upon the subject is false <br/>
I have been willing to go before any Governor Judge <br/>
or Tribunal where justicee could be done and have the <br/>
subject investigated. I could not have committed</p>",
42828.0,408,,"<p>treason in that [[Missouri|State]] while there. I had no controle <br/>
anywhere there in temporal things but in spiritual <br/>
I was driven from that State by force of arms <br/>
under the exterminating order of Governor [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]</p>

<p>I never committed treason, the people <br/>
know very well. I have been a peaceable <br/>
citizen but there has been a great hue and cry <br/>
about Governor Boggs being shot. No crime <br/>
can be done but what it is laid to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Jo. Smith]] <br/>
Here I was again dragged to the United States <br/>
Court and was cleared and now it comes again <br/>
<strike>But</strike> As often as God sees fit for me to suffer <br/>
I am ready; but I am as inocent of these <br/>
crimes as the angels in heaven. I am not <br/>
an enemy to mankind. I am a friend <br/>
to mankind. I am not an enemy to <br/>
Missouri nor to any Governors or people.</p>

<p>As to the military station I <br/>
hold and the cause of my holding it, it is <br/>
thus:</p>

<p>When we came here the [[Illinois|State]] required <br/>
us to bear arms and do military duty according <br/>
to law; and as the Church had just been <br/>
driven from Missouri and robbed of all their <br/>
property and arms they were poor, and <br/>
destitute of arms. They were liable to be <br/>
fined for not doing duty when they had no <br/>
arms to do it with. They came to me for <br/>
advice. I advised them to organize themselves <br/>
into indipendant companies and demand arms <br/>
of the State. This they did. Again there <br/>
were many Elders having licence to preach which <br/>
by law ex^onorate^ them from military duty <br/>
but the officers would not release them on <br/>
this ground. I then told the Saints that <br/>
though I was clear of military duty by law <br/>
in consequence of lameness in one of my <br/>
legs yet I would set them the example</p>",
42828.0,409,,"<p>and do duty myself. They then said they were willing <br/>
to do duty if they could be formed into an indipendant <br/>
company and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] could be at their head. Upon this <br/>
ground came the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Legion and I holding the <br/>
office of Lieutenant General. Not that I seek for <br/>
power.</p>

<p>And with regard to elections. Some <br/>
say we all vote together and vote as I say; but I <br/>
never tell my man how to vote nor who to vote <br/>
for. But I will show you how we have been <br/>
situated by bringing a comparison:</p>

<p>^Supposing there^ Should there be a Methodist<br/>
Society here and two candidates running for office;<br/>
one says if you will vote for me and put me in <br/>
Governor I will exterminate the Methodists and <br/>
take away their charters &amp;c. The other says <br/>
if I am Governor I will give all an equal privilege.<br/>
Which would the Methodist vote for? Of course <br/>
they would vote in mass for the candidate who <br/>
would give them their rights</p>

<p>Thus it has been with us. [[Joseph Duncan|Joseph <br/>
Duncan]] said if the people would elect him he would <br/>
exterminate the Mormons and take away their <br/>
charters. As to Mr [[Thomas Ford|Ford]] he made no such threats<br/>
but manifested a spirit in his speeches to give <br/>
every man his rights. Hence the Church universally <br/>
voted for Mr Ford and he was elected Governor <br/>
But he has issued writs against me the first time <br/>
the Missourians made the demand and this is <br/>
the second one he has issued for me which has <br/>
cause me much trouble and expence.""</p>

<p>Joseph also rehearsed the account of <br/>
his being taken by [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] and [[Abel B. Wilson|Wilson]] and <br/>
the unlawful treatment he received at their <br/>
hands. The multitude gave good attention <br/>
and much prejudice seemed to be removed</p>",
42828.0,410,,"<p>I arose early on the morning of ^the^ 7th of <br/>
July laid hands upon Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and blessed <br/>
her and our daughter [[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe Amelia]] and started <br/>
on my mission.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the same<br/>
day we left [[A. Morrison|Morrison]]s Landing  on the steam-<br/>
boat Rapids. Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]]<br/>
and myself were together of the Twelve. [[Eli P. Maginn|E. P. Magin]]<br/>
was also in our company. We arrived in [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St <br/>
Louis]] the next day.</p>

<p>I called at Mr [[William Philips|Philips]] Paper <br/>
Warehouse and made purchaces for [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]]  and <br/>
Woodruff of the ""Times and Seasons"" office and <br/>
shiped it for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Next day we left on the ""Lancet"" bound <br/>
for [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]] where we arrived on the 13th <br/>
We had a view of President [[William Henry Harrison|Harrison]]'s Toomb<br/>
on our way</p>

<p>Elder Smith was quite ^sick^ throughout <br/>
the night of our arrival. I dreamt that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]</p>",
42828.0,411,,"<p>was again taken with another writ and was to be tried in <br/>
[[Illinois|Illinois]]. On this night [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] also dreamt that <br/>
we were called home.</p>

<p>At [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]] I shipped 30 reams of <br/>
paper for the Times and Seasons and we spent the interval <br/>
to the 22nd in visiting the Saints and Branches near; and then<br/>
left for [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] on board the Adelade <strike>for Pittsburg</strike> where <br/>
we arrived on the 27th at 6 o'clock p.m.</p>

<p>There was a meeting that night in the <br/>
city at the Temperance Hall to which we repaired and <br/>
about the first persons we saw were Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]]<br/>
and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]].</p>

<p>We heard the voice of [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] <br/>
preaching as we entered. He hammered the sects<br/>
during his discourse and at the close he informed the <br/>
people of our arrival which made six of the ^Twelve^ in the <br/>
city.</p>

<p>Next day our quorum held a council <br/>
and Brigham its president enquired concerning the <br/>
proceedings of the Twelve at Cincinnati, and found <br/>
that elders Kimball O. Pratt and John E. Page held <br/>
a conference and organized the Church there and <br/>
their Elders Pratt and Kimball left for Pittsburgh <br/>
but Elder Page stayed behind &amp; in a few days <br/>
disunited what he been done and reorganized the <br/>
Church</p>

<p>President Young reproved John E. Page <br/>
for undoing what three of the quorum of the Twelve <br/>
had done together and spoke also of[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]'s counsel<br/>
to be gentle and mild in our teachings and not <br/>
to battle with the sects but win the affections <br/>
of the people.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh resembled the English <br/>
cities in consequence of the burning of so much <br/>
stone coal which covered the ^city with the^ the dustiness of the smoke<br/>
Its population was about 35,000 it had 120 preachers<br/>
95 Churches and 21 denominations and <strike>the Branch</strike><br/>
the Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints numbered <br/>
seventy-five souls. </p>",
42828.0,412,,"<p>404</p>

<p>Sunday the 30th six of the quorum of the Twelve <br/>
met at Temperance Hall in [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] with the Saints<br/>
In the morning I addressed the meeting followed by <br/>
[[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]]; in the afternoon [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson<br/>
Pratt]], and in the evening [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] followed <br/>
by [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]].</p>

<p><u>Items</u><br/>
<u>from</u></p>

<p>Brigham Young's Remarks</p>

<p>Among many other things he said</p>

<p>""Why do the people oppose the gifts and graces?<br/>
If a man can get faith by the power of God and <br/>
the gift of the Holy Ghost so as to lay hands <br/>
upon his wife and children or friends when <br/>
they lie sick and languishing nigh unto <br/>
death and command the fever or disease or <br/>
even death itself to depart and the person is <br/>
releived I ask what harm is there in all this?<br/>
Or if a man by faith and humility before <br/>
God can get the testimony of Jesus and prophesy <br/>
of things to come or speak in tongues or cast <br/>
out devils I ask what harm in all this?<br/>
Does it do any harm? No it does not.</p>

<p>I know the New Testament <br/>
is true; for I have proved it according to <br/>
the pattern given by beleiving in Christ <br/>
obeying the Gospel and knowing the signs <br/>
do follow. Then I ask do these things<br/>
harm any one? No they do not.""</p>

<p>In speaking of the Kingdom of <br/>
God he said</p>

<p>""The Kingdom must be <br/>
together; the people must be gathered into </p>",
42828.0,413,,"<p>405</p>

<p>one place. For how would the King of [[France|France]] or [[England|England]]<br/>
succeed in undertaking to reign over a Kingdom when the <br/>
people were scattered all over the world except in France<br/>
or England. They could not reign over a people unless <br/>
the people were with those kings to reign over</p>

<p>So with the Saints. They must be <br/>
gathered together and this work has already commenced <br/>
And who is the author of this work and gathering?<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the Prophet as an instrument in the <br/>
hands of God is the Author of it. <u>He</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>greatest</u><br/>
<u>man</u> <u>on</u> <u>earth</u>. No other man of this age has <br/>
power to assemble such a great people from all the <br/>
nations of the earth with all their varied dispositions<br/>
and assimilate them and cement them together<br/>
so that they might be subject to rule and order <br/>
This the Prophet is doing; and that which makes <br/>
a great King president or man is to have a great <br/>
people to rule over.""</p>

<p>Next day our quorum assembled and took <br/>
a tour through the [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|city]]. We visited Curling's<br/>
Glass Works and saw them work through each <br/>
branch of manufacture; we then went to the <br/>
bluff above the city and had a view of the new <br/>
Basin to be filled with water forced from the <br/>
[[Allegheny River, United States|Alleghaney River]] to supply the city below of <br/>
which we had a fair view.</p>

<p>Descending the hill we had a <br/>
view of the city water works. The building was <br/>
after the Roman order cost two hundred thousand dollars <br/>
and was designed and executed by Elder [[Charles Beck|Charles Beck]]<br/>
a member of the Church of Latter-day Saints</p>

<p>Afterwards we visited Miltonburgers <br/>
Ironworks through each of its branches and saw the <br/>
keel laid for an iron steam ship of war. The keel was<br/>
140 ft. in length</p>",
42828.0,414,,"<p>406</p>

<p>Elder [[Charles Beck|Charles Beck]] paid 40 dollars for <br/>
stage fare of six of the Twelve to [[Baltimore, Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore]] and <br/>
a collection was taken up of about 20 dollars to <br/>
assist us to [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] at which place we <br/>
arrived on the 5th of August. <strike>having left [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]<br/>
on the 3rd</strike>.</p>

<p>On <strike>the</strike> ^Sunday^ afternoon of the 6th which <br/>
<strike>was Sunday</strike> we met in the Canaanite Church <br/>
about 300 Saints. Elder [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]] opened the meeting <br/>
<strike>and</strike> ^which^  President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] addressed <strike>the<br/>
meeting</strike> at considerable length. Among other <br/>
things he said</p>

<p>""A man or a woman may <br/>
ask of God and get a witness and testimony from <br/>
O concerning any work or massenger sent, <br/>
unto them; but if a person asks for a thing <br/>
that does not concern him such as governing <br/>
the Church &amp;c he will not get an answer and <br/>
if he does it will not be from God""</p>

<p>He also remarked in conversation<br/>
upon the inquiry of Who had the ^fulness of this^ Melchisidec<br/>
Priesthood that it may if any in the Church had it <br/>
he did not know it. For a person to have <br/>
^the <span class=""unclear"">[fulniss]</span> of^ that Priesthood he must be a King and a <br/>
Priest. <strike>A person</strike> ^He^ might have a portion <br/>
of it <strike>that Priesthood</strike> the same as the governors or <br/>
Judges of [[England|England]] have power from the King to <br/>
transact business but <strike>he is</strike> ^they are^ not the King <br/>
<strike>of England</strike>. A person may be anointed <br/>
King and Priest before he receives his <br/>
Kingdom &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the evening [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
preached, followed by remarks from [[George Albert Smith|George <br/>
A Smith]]. One the morning of this <br/>
Sabath I went with Elder Young and others <br/>
to a a Millerite MEeting. Here we heard <br/>
a Mr Litz preach a sermon destroying the <br/>
literan reurn of the Jews and rebuilding of [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]</p>",
42828.0,415,,"<p>407</p>

<p>Two days afterwards the Twelve and <br/>
about 150 Saints took an excursion on board a steamer <br/>
As we glided over the water we passed the new frigate <br/>
Rariton of sixty four guns and reached [[Gloucester Point, Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloster Point]]<br/>
were we spent the day in feasting fishing swinging<br/>
walking singing and discussing various subjects</p>

<p>One of the subjects which arose <br/>
for discussion was, ""Is the prosperity of any religions <br/>
denomination a positive evidence that they are right?""</p>

<p>Elder [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] contended for <br/>
the affirmative and Elder [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] for the negative <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] the chairman decided that the<br/>
prosperity of any people was not positive evidence <br/>
of their being right.</p>

<p>We returned to the [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|city]] and <br/>
during the evening my mind was deeply exercised <br/>
with the impression taht my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] was in distress <br/>
or afflicted. I prayed for her before the Lord <br/>
and my mind was releived</p>

<p>During the week we held meetings <br/>
several times and visited public places.</p>

<p>on one of the days Elders Young <br/>
[[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]] [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]] myself and [[Peter Hesse Jr.|P. Hesse]] visited <br/>
the State House and on the tope of the teeple we <br/>
had a fine view of the city of Philadelphia<br/>
Descending to the [[Independence Hall, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Indipendance Hall]] we saw the <br/>
place where the Patriots signed the Declaration <br/>
and sat in the chair in which [[John Hancock|John Hancock]]<br/>
sat in at the time he signed that instrument</p>

<p>Next day we visited barious parts <br/>
of the city especially [[Peale Museum, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Peel's Museum]] where among many <br/>
other things of note we saw and examined the body <br/>
of the Mermaid and the skeleton of a Mamouth</p>

<p>On the 14th I parted from the <br/>
Philadelphia Saints and in company with Elders <br/>
Orson Pratt and [[William Moore|Wm Moor]] took steamboat to <br/>
[[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Skoolkill]] and then walked 6 miles to Mr. [[Titus Mousley|Mosley]]'s <br/>
and preached in the evening followed by O. Pratt</p>",
42828.0,416,,"<p>408</p>

<p>We journeyed 24 miles the next day and <br/>
during our days ride we passed over the ground of <br/>
the Brandywine battle saw where the action commenced <br/>
were the Americans retreated and a part of them surrendered <br/>
and saw also where [[George Washington|Washington]] led away the remainder <br/>
of the army</p>

<p>The day after Elder [[William Moore|Moor]] and <br/>
myself travelled 25 miles to brother [[John Neff, b. 1794|John Neff]]'s in <br/>
[[Strasburgh, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Strasburgh]] and found him disposed to sell his <br/>
property and go to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and take stock in the <br/>
[[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] <strike>&amp;c [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]</strike> On the way we passed by <br/>
the country throughout this region exceedingly rich <br/>
and fertile</p>

<p>We continued our journey on <br/>
the succeeding day to [[West Nantmeal Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|West Nantmeal]] and on <br/>
the next in the evening met with Elder [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] <br/>
and others and held meeting at West Nantmeal<br/>
Seminary and the day after commenced a two <br/>
days meeting 12 miles distant in a Grove in <br/>
[[Uwchlan Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Uwchland Township]]</p>

<p>The second day of our camp <br/>
meeting was Sunday August 20th. A good <br/>
congregation came together and I addressed them <br/>
in the forepart of the day from the text—""If <br/>
our Gospel be hid it is hid to them that are less"" &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Elder O. Pratt <br/>
delivered a powerful discourse from Revelations <br/>
22 ch 3rd verse ""And there shall be no more <br/>
curse. He began with the fall and <br/>
traced his subject through to the Millennium the <br/>
Second Advent the binding of Satan and the <br/>
New heaven and the New earth when Christ shall <br/>
deliver the Kingdom up unto his Father and the <br/>
last enemy Death be destroyed.</p>

<p>Next day we returned by <br/>
rail to [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] where we met Elder [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]]</p>",
42828.0,417,,"<p>409</p>

<p>but found that the rest of the Twelve had left the [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|city]] for <br/>
[[New York|New York]] where we followed them two days later</p>

<p>Conference at New York<br/>
held<br/>
August 26, 1843.</p>

<p>The quorum of the Twelve met the Saints <br/>
in Conference at New York on this day</p>

<p>After prayer President [[Brigham Young|Young]] opened <br/>
the buisness of the Conference by an interesting address<br/>
upon the subject of the gathering, — the President and the <br/>
building of the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]].</p>

<p>In the afternoon Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
spoke very graphically in parables; and Elder [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A. Smith]] followed with anecdotes: One related to <br/>
his collegiate education received from the Prophet which <br/>
was to preach short sermons and make short prayers</p>

<p><u>Remarks</u> <u>of</u> <u>President</u> <u>Brigham</u> <u>Young</u></p>

<p>Elder Young next spoke; and among other remarks <br/>
he said</p>

<p>""The Scriptures have been mistified <br/>
to that degree that the greatest divine of the day is <br/>
as ignorant as the dumb ass concerning the things <br/>
of God. They know not their right hand <br/>
from their left and we are trying to reverse it <br/>
by making the things of God so simple that <br/>
the people can understand</p>

<p>Place a man in this room who <br/>
is ignorant of science and take everything out that <br/>
we can see and then ask him if there is anything <br/>
in the room. He will say no nothing but <br/>
us two. I tell him there are millions of live<br/>
animals in the room and that even we breathe them</p>",
42828.0,418,,"<p>410</p>

<p>and [[Brigham Young|I]] will show him by the aid of the ms<br/>
that there are live animals in one drop of water <br/>
eight feet long but he will not beleive me until <br/>
he sees it through the magnifying glass.</p>

<p>So with the unbeleiver. He <br/>
does not beleive<strike>d</strike> in God — in angels — in spirits<br/>
because he does not see them but let him have <br/>
spiritual glasses — or let him obey the commandments <br/>
of God and get the Spirit of God and then <br/>
he can see.""</p>

<p>The following was also given</p>

<p><u>Interesting Questions &amp; Answers</u></p>

<p>On the following day Conference was <br/>
continued. Meeting was opened by singing and <br/>
prayer by Elder [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]] after which Elder Woodruff<br/>
delivered a discourse from the 2nd Epistle of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]]<br/>
1st ch., <strike>&amp;c</strike> 20, 21 verses.</p>

<p>Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] followed with <br/>
some appropriate remarks and in the afternoon <br/>
[[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] gave a lengthy discourse proving the <br/>
divine mission of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and the truth <br/>
of the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>In the evening Elder [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]]<br/>
delibered a masterly discourse upon the Book of <br/>
Mormon. He said it was the history of <br/>
nearly one half of the Globe and of the people who <br/>
had inhabited it, — that it gave the history <br/>
of all the cities which had since it cam forth <br/>
been discovered by Cartherwood and Stephens —<br/>
that it spoke of the establishing of our government <br/>
and what is more highly interesting it revels <br/>
its final fate and destiny so that by reading <br/>
the Book of Mormon it may be clearly seen <br/>
what will befall this nation and what will <br/>
be its final end. In that Book is also the <br/>
Gospel as taught by Jesus Christ himself to the <br/>
ancient inhabitants of America and an account</p>",
42828.0,420,,"<p>412</p>

<p>of his ministry amongst them after his resurrection<br/>
and Assension. This was the path of his discourse <br/>
occupying nearly two hours.</p>

<p>I left [[New York|New York]] on the 24th in <br/>
company with Elders [[Elisha Hildebrand Davis|Davis]] and [[Charles Wesley Wandell|Wandell]] and having <br/>
visited Branches on my road I arrived at [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]<br/>
my native place on the 2nd of September and <br/>
left my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]'s house again on the 5th and <br/>
on the 8th arrived at the City of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] where <br/>
I found Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and another <br/>
brother waiting for me at the station.</p>

<p>Conference</p>

<p>held by <br/>
The Quorum of the Twelve<br/>
at<br/>
at Boston in Boylston Hall<br/>
Sep. 9th, 1843,</p>

<p>There were present of the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] Wilford Woodruff<br/>

called for the business of the meeting after which the <br/>
churches were represented</p>

<p>During this conference there <br/>
were discourses delivered by all the members of <br/>
the quorum of the Twelve present their subjects<br/>
being chiefly upon the gathering building the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]<br/>
and kindred matters. It would be too lengthy to <br/>
give the synopsis of the whole of them as recorded <br/>
in my daily Journal of the time. The substance <br/>
of several must suffice.</p>",
42828.0,421,,"<p>413</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] led the van upon the Gathering <br/>
and then President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] further laid before <br/>
the Conference the subject and design of this mission <br/>
of the Twelve to the eastern churches.</p>

<p>Synopsis<br/>
of the</p>

<p>Discourse of President Brigham Young</p>

<p>I wish to make a few remarks <br/>
concerning the subject of our faith. We hear the <br/>
Elders represent the feelings of the brethren concerning <br/>
the gathering</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Lord Jesus <br/>
Christ is a gathering Spirit. Its tendency is to <br/>
gather the virtuous and good — the honest and meek <br/>
of the earth — in fine the Saints of God.</p>

<p>The time has come when the <br/>
<strike>virtuous and</strike> ^Lord has^ determined to fulfill his pruposes <br/>
""Had we lived in the days of Christ,"" the people <br/>
say, we would have received his work. But judge<br/>
ye if the people are better now than they were then. <br/>
They are not.</p>

<p>When the full set time was come <br/>
the Lord came in the flesh to do his work whether <br/>
the people were prepared or not. And <u>now</u><br/>
the full set time is come for the Lord God Almighty <br/>
to set his hand to redeem [[Israel|Israel]]</p>

<p>We are not bound to make the <br/>
people beleive but to preach the Gospel and then <br/>
our garments are clear.</p>

<p>The Lord does not require every <br/>
soul to leave his home as soon as he beleives <br/>
but he requires him to hearken to counsel and <br/>
follw that course which the Lord points out</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Almighty <span class=""unclear"">[an[d]]</span><br/>
of this work is on the <strike>elect</strike> ^alert^ and those who keep</p>",
42828.0,422,,"<p>414</p>

<p>up with the work must be on the alert also</p>

<p>When the Lord says gather <br/>
yourselves together why do you ask Him, what <br/>
for? Is it not the principle of the Saints to <br/>
mingle together to promote the great cause in <br/>
which we are engaged?</p>

<p>To you Say, cannot the Lord <br/>
save us as well where we are as <strike>to</strike>^when^   gathered together?<br/>
Yes if the Lord says so but if he commands <br/>
us to come out and gather together He will <br/>
not save us by ^our^ staying at home. Have you <br/>
not received the Gospel? Yes. Then do <br/>
you beleive what we say. Have you not received <br/>
the Holy Ghost by receiving the Gospel which <br/>
we have brought and it stands as a testimony <br/>
that God has a Prophet upon the earth</p>

<p>You might have been baptized <br/>
seventy times seven in any way except the one <br/>
God ordained and pointed out and you would <br/>
not have received the Holy Ghost. This also <br/>
is a testimony to you.</p>

<p>Are you engaged in the great work with us? You will say Yes. Can you <br/>
do any good? <strike>you</strike> ^You can^ The Sectarian world <br/>
saw the Bible to the nations of the earth. The <br/>
people put in sixpence fifty cents or a dollar into <br/>
the box and send Bibles through the world. Then <br/>
cannot you do something? Yes.</p>

<p>The Lord requires us to build <br/>
a house unto His name that the ordinances and <br/>
blessings of his Kingdom might be revealed and <br/>
that the Elders may be endorsed to go forth and <br/>
gather together the Good of [[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]] — the people <br/>
of God from the ends of the earth</p>

<p>Can you get an endowment in <br/>
[[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]]? No. And only in that place which <br/>
God has appointed.</p>",
42828.0,423,,"<p>415</p>

<p>Now query: Could [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] have got the <br/>
law had he remained in the midst of the children of <br/>
[[Israel|Israel]] and not gone into the mountsin? The Lord said <br/>
Go and do so and so. Stand before Pharoah. Pull off <br/>
your shoes for the ground is holy &amp;c. Moses obeyed <br/>
and obtained the blessing; but if he had not obeyed he <br/>
would not have obtained the blessing.</p>

<p>But why query about it at all? Has <br/>
the Lord spoken? Yes. Then that is enough. [[Brigham Young|I]] <br/>
do not care whether the people gather or not. If they <br/>
don't want to I do not wish to have the people against <br/>
their will. I wish you to have youre choice — either to <br/>
gather with the righteous or they with the wicked. <br/>
I would like to have all people bow down to the Lord <br/>
Jesus Christ but it is one of the decrees of the Lord <br/>
that all persons shall act upon their agency which <br/>
was the case even with the angels that fell from heaven</p>

<p>Now will you help us build <br/>
the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] and [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]? If so you will <br/>
be blessed; if not we will build it alone. And <br/>
if you do not hearken you will not have the <br/>
Spirit of the Lord for the Spirit of the Lord <br/>
is in the gathering.</p>

<p>The Apostles tried to gather <br/>
together the people in their den. Christ said he <br/>
would have gathered the Jews oft as a hen gathereth <br/>
her chicken under her wings; but they would <br/>
not</p>

<p>It mattereth not to God and angels<br/>
whether men hear or forbear. They will carry <br/>
on their work for the full set time is come <br/>
<u>We</u> care about it. We must build a house and <br/>
get an endowment and preach the gospel warn <br/>
the people gather the Saints build up Zion <br/>
finish out work and be prepared for the coming <br/>
of Christ</p>

<p>Now we want to send missionaries</p>",
42828.0,424,,"<p>416</p>

<p>to the Islands. Can you do something for the And <br/>
that is not all. We want you to contribute to the <br/>
building of the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]. We want what you have to <br/>
spare. but are you affraid that you will not have <br/>
enough for yourselves when you get there? How easy <br/>
it is for the Lord to take it away from you by <br/>
fire and otherwise. [[Eli P. Maginn|E. P. Magin]] had an ivory <br/>
cane. [[Brigham Young|I]] asked him for it but he did not give <br/>
it to me; but he soon lost it and it did neither <br/>
of us any good</p>

<p>The Lord can give and take away <br/>
[[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]] with his faith obtained all the best cattle that <br/>
his father in law had. Who blessed you and all the <br/>
people. God. But do the people acknowledge <br/>
His hand in all things. No they turn away<br/>
from Him and do not acknowledge Him nor realize<br/>
from whom their blessings flow</p>

<p>Let me tell you a secret. When <br/>
the Lord shakes the earth and the hills fall <br/>
down and the valleys are exalted then for brass<br/>
He will bring gold for iron silver and for stones <br/>
iron. That you will have no use for gold <strike>and</strike> ^for money^<br/>
<strike>the like</strike> as you now have but the Lord will think <br/>
as much of it then as now.</p>

<p>Let us have some of your gold <br/>
to take to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo <br/>
House]] so that when the kings princes and nobles <br/>
of the earth call to enquire after the wisdom of Zion<br/>
we may have a place to entertain them, and <br/>
that the weary traveller may also be refreshed</p>

<p>Is there wisdom in Zion? We think <br/>
so; and the world begin to think so. Let the world <br/>
come forty and translate the plates that have of late <br/>
come forth if they have wisdom to do it;</p>

<p>The Lord intends to take away <br/>
the gods of the gentiles. He pulleth down and <br/>
buildeth up at his own pleasure. Dont be affraid<br/>
of a dollar or a hundred or a thousand dollars</p>",
42828.0,425,,"<p>417</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] would not. I have made sacrifices a great many <br/>
times. The Lord has promised a hundred fold and <br/>
I have taken this course to get rich — to give all <br/>
I had and God has given me many blessings in <br/>
consequence. If I have been too bold in asking them <br/>
be you too bold in giving. Give your all and <br/>
God will repay as much again.""</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]] took up <br/>
the subject of the morning. He said they not only <br/>
wanted the gold and the silver but we thank you<br/>
and your wives and children and all you have <br/>
He then spoke of the policy of [[Joseph (OT)|Joseph]] in [[Egypt|Egypt]]<br/>
and closed by saying</p>

<p>""Does the Saints here in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]]<br/>
know they are identified with the laying of the foundation <br/>
of a great and mighty work that is to enclude<br/>
all the great and glorious purposes of God which <br/>
are to be fulfilled in the last dispensation and <br/>
fulness of times. And I prophesy in the <br/>
name of the Lord that whether the Boston Saints <br/>
or who may stand for it or rise against it <br/>
that almost numberless millions will celebrate <br/>
that day when the foundation of this work <br/>
was laid.""</p>

<p>Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] followed <br/>
upon the subject of what ^seems^ to the people but small <br/>
things in the revelations of God in variouss ages <br/>
but showed their great importance in the issue <br/>
and instanced the building the ark &amp;c. He <br/>
also took up the gathering and treated the meeting <br/>
to a spice of common ^sense^ versus the mysteries and <br/>
concluded with an illustrative anecdote of how <br/>
Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] was sent for by a certain people <br/>
and brought forty miles to preach the mysteries <br/>
and the amusing sequel of how he read them <br/>
a lesson of practical religion</p>",
42828.0,426,,"<p>418</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] arose and said</p>

<p>""I will ^offer^ an apology for my remarks <br/>
in the forefront of the day. Some may think <br/>
I spoke very plain but the apology I have to <br/>
make is that I will turn Thomsonion docter <br/>
and give the composition without sweetening. This <br/>
work is all — it is my all. If this work does <br/>
not live God knows I do not want to live; <br/>
and I want you to understand that he that <br/>
gathereth not with us scattereth and they that <br/>
have tasted the bitter cup will feel it</p>

<p>Wake up ye Elders who <br/>
have sought to build yourselves up and not <br/>
the Kingdom of God! Wake  up ye who <br/>
have daubed with untempered morter. Hearken <br/>
and hear me for I say unto ^you^ that if you <br/>
do not help us build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo<br/>
House]] you shall not inherit the land of <br/>
Zion. If you do not help build up Zion <br/>
and the cuase of God you shall not partake <br/>
of their blessings.</p>

<p>Many Elders seek to build <br/>
themselves up and not the work of God; but <br/>
when any one does this no matter who he <br/>
may be ^he will not prosper^ even if one of the Twelve. As to <br/>
those of the Twelve and others of the Elders who <br/>
have apostatised I have known their hearts &amp;<br/>
their breathings and known their movements <br/>
They thoughtI did not know much but <br/>
I knew all abou t them; and when I see<br/>
men preaching he build themselves up and <br/>
not Zion I know what it will end in. But <br/>
say you I am young. I do not care if <br/>
you are young. Do you know what you <br/>
are about. If so preach and labour for the <br/>
building up of the city of Zion. Concentrate <br/>
your means and influence there and not scatter<br/>
abroad. Be faithful or you will not be</p>",
42828.0,427,,"<p>419</p>

<p>chosen; for the day of choosing is at the door.</p>

<p>Why be afraid of a sacrifice?<br/>
[[Brigham Young|I]] have given my all many times and am willing <br/>
to do it again. I would be glad to hear the Lord<br/>
say through His servant [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], let my servant<br/>
Brigham give again all he has. I would obey in <br/>
a moment if it took the last coat from off my <br/>
back""</p>

<p><u>Remarks of Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]</u></p>

<p>Among other things he said</p>

<p>""I speak in parables. I conpare <br/>
the Saints to a good cow. When you milk her<br/>
clean she will always have abundance of milk to <br/>
give; but if you milk her a little <strike>and</strike> she will <br/>
soon dry up. So with the Saints. If they <br/>
do but little in building up Zion they soon have <br/>
but little to do with. This was the case <br/>
in [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]]. I had a dream concerning <br/>
the Saints there. I thought I was in a field <br/>
of wheat that was staked up; and we had to <br/>
draw it into the barn; but when we came to <br/>
open the stack the bundles would all fall to <br/>
pieces and it was filled with clusters of rats <br/>
and mice who had been eating up the grain<br/>
I thought that these rats and mice were the <br/>
Elders and official members of the Church — living on the wheat, <br/>
eating them up instead of building up new<br/>
churches so that when the Twelve came along <br/>
they could not get anything for the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] or <br/>
[[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] or hardly a place to stay the <br/>
rats had eaten up the wheat so. We had to <br/>
go to the world for a home to stay while we <br/>
were there.</p>

<p>We are not polished stones like Elders</p>",
42828.0,428,,"<p>420</p>

<p>[[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Babbit]] [[George Washington Joshua Adams|Adams]] [[James Blakesly|Blakely]] [[Eli P. Maginn|Magin]] and the like. We <br/>
are rough stones out of the mountain and when we <br/>
roll through the forest and knock the bark off <br/>
the trees it does not hurt us even if we should <br/>
get a corner knocked off occassionally. The more <br/>
we roll and get the corners knocked off the better <br/>
we are; but if we were polished and smooth when <br/>
we got the corners knocked off it would deface <br/>
us</p>

<p>This is the case with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]].<br/>
He never professed to be a dressed smooth polished <br/>
stone but was rough out of the mountains and <br/>
has been rolling among the rocks and trees and it <br/>
has not hurt him at all. But he will be as <br/>
smooth and polished in the end as any other <br/>
stone while many that were so very polished and <br/>
smooth in the beginning yet badly defaced and <br/>
spoiled while rolling about.""</p>

<p>Elders [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] followed and <br/>
then the Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock the <br/>
next morning</p>

<p>^We continued^ Conference the next day which was <br/>
Sunday and in the morning I preached a lengthy <br/>
discourse forom the 3rd ch of [[Amos (OT)|Amos]] verse 7th.</p>

<p>I left [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on the 12th of September <br/>
at 5 o'clock p.m. in the Express train for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]<br/>
and at about 10 o'clock while passing through [[Chesterwoods, Maine|Chester<br/>
woods]] 6 miles south of [[Kennebunk, York County, Maine|Kennebunk]] the engine <br/>
was thrown from the track in consequence of a rail<br/>
being raised eight inches by some designing misreant<br/>
The force was such that it drove the engine <br/>
about five rods ahead and smashed it to pieces with <br/>
the baggage cars piled upon the top of it</p>

<p>One lady was brused but not dangerously <br/>
and another was slightly injured. The lives of many <br/>
were in danger and it seemed a mystry that so little</p>",
42828.0,429,,"<p>421</p>

<p>injury was done. Four cars were filled with passengers and <br/>
had not the force of the coll^ission^ been broken by the baggage <br/>
cars many lives would have been lost.</p>

<p>The baggge cares w^ere^ soon on fire which <br/>
was with difficulty extinguished. The fireman was <br/>
thrown about three <span class=""unclear"">[rods]</span> and escaped with a slight injury <br/>
but the engineer Mr Adams from [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]] was <br/>
burried beneath the pile and instantly killed and the <br/>
ruins had to be removed before the corps of the illfated <br/>
engineer could be optained. No blame could be <br/>
attached to him for the raised rail gave no warning <br/>
until the engine and baggage cars were in one pile <br/>
of ruins. The unfortunate man left a wife and <br/>
one child</p>

<p>A Mr [[Thomas Hall|Thomas Hall]] opened his <br/>
house for the passengers and much praise was due <br/>
to him and his houshold for their hospitality</p>

<p>I spent most of the night in the <br/>
woods and got chilled through</p>

<p>They sent to Portland for another <br/>
engine which arrived in time to take us to Portland <br/>
in the morning.</p>

<p>Arriving at Portland I furnished the <br/>
Editor of the American with</p>

<p>The Account of our Railway Accident</p>

<p>I visited my brother in-law [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra Carter]] and <br/>
wrote t^wo^ more letters giving an account of the foregoing <br/>
catastrophe — one was to the Editor of the ""Boston Bee""<br/>
the other to Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] Editor of the ""Times <br/>
and Seasons""</p>

<p>On the same day I walke to <br/>
[[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarbourough]] and arrived in the evening at the house <br/>
of my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]'s parents. Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter]] was at [[New York|New<br/>
York]] I came upon [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]] so sudden as she <br/>
was walking across the room with a candle that <br/>
she was as much surprised as though I had came</p>",
42828.0,430,,"<p>422</p>

<p>down from the skies and [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|her]] first salutation was where<br/>
did you come from?</p>

<p>This was the first time I had been to <br/>
my f [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]'s parents house without Phebe being with me <br/>
and I felt like the dove without its mate. But <br/>
after conversing till 9 o'clock with mother and [[Joseph Fabyan Carter|Fabyan]]<br/>
my wife's brother<strike>-in-law</strike> I prayed with them and <br/>
then retired to my chamber and there prayed for my <br/>
absent companion and our children.</p>

<p>Next day I rode round the country <br/>
with my brother-in-law Fabyan visiting our friends <br/>
and relations. I called at Mr [[Arthur Milliken|Milliken]]s and <br/>
found Arthur Milliken and his wife [[Lucy Smith Millikin|Lucy]] the youngest <br/>
sister of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. They were both home <br/>
sick for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>The next two days passed in <br/>
family associations and after spending the evening of <br/>
the second day in conversing with Faban, [[Rhoda Milliken Carter|Rhoda]]<br/>
and mother about Mormonism <strike>&amp;c</strike> I took my light <br/>
and went to bed fearing I should not see [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Father]]<br/>
but just as I was about to blow the light out a wagon <br/>
drove up and I jumped out of bed dressed and was <br/>
soon down grasping the hand of my wife's father.<br/>
I sat up and talked with him till about 11 o'clock <br/>
and I thought both Father and Mother looked no <br/>
older than when I saw them before and they were <br/>
enjoying excellent health. It seemed quite natural <br/>
the next morning to sit at the table with my <br/>
wife's parents again but I very much missed <br/>
Phebe during this visit. The day after<br/>
I took my final call upon my friends and relatives <br/>
and bade them adieu and then took the <br/>
cars and arrived in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] that night.</p>

<p>The next day after my return <br/>
to Boston I called upon [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and <br/>
<strike>W. W.</strike> [[William Wines Phelps|Phelps]]. In the afternoon I went on <br/>
the parade ground and saw the militia in a sham <br/>
fight and they made quite a splendid appearance</p>",
42828.0,431,,"<p>[4]23</p>

<p>On the following evening I visited the celebrated <br/>
phenologist [[Orson Squire Fowler|O. S. Fowler]] of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] who had examined<br/>
the heads of the Twelve. He gave me</p>

<p>My Phenological Chart.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff:</p>

<p>Is a man of great action both <br/>
physical and mental; does up things in a hurry;<br/>
lets nothing sleep in his hands; great resolution;<br/>
steamboat speed; loves his liberty; is not disposed <br/>
to be subject to the will or dictations of others; has <br/>
great indipendance; difficulties only stimulate him<br/>
to increased action; goes in for the largest liberty <br/>
of the mass and is a democrat of the old school; <br/>
prefers utility to beauty and substance to show; <br/>
highly social and fond of family and friends; has <br/>
but few secrets of his own and tells the plain un-<br/>
varnished facts; fears but little danger; is not <br/>
irressolute but de<strike>s</strike>cides and proceeds at once to action;<br/>
His first thoughts are always best. He does up his <br/>
own religious thinking and does not hang his hopes upon <br/>
the faith of others. He believes but little without proof; <br/>
is a two edged sword — if he does not cut one way, <br/>
does another. He makes positive friends or positive <br/>
enemies; has much severity; is sarcastic; bitter<br/>
in reporaches; means to do right; feals the <br/>
force of moral obligations. His jokes have more <br/>
vinegar than molasses in them. He recollects <br/>
and explains facts well; reasons by inference from <br/>
the facts, by analogy and induction; has good <br/>
talking talents; and is noted for his clear illustrations</p>

<p>I took a walk with [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] to [[Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Charleston]]<br/>
on the 22nd. We first visited the Navy Yard of the <br/>
United States then the dry dock and next the U.S. <br/>
Rope Walk which we inspected in all its branches</p>

<p>We took dinner and then visited <br/>
[[Bunker Hill Monument, Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Bunker Hill Monument]]. I entered the tube and <br/>
was drawn up by steam 2<strike>0</strike>20 feet when I had a <br/>
view of all [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] Charleston [[Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] [[Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Chelsea]] &amp;c<br/>
and then descended by the same way. Next <br/>
came the State prisons with 262 prisoners as their <br/>
various branches of business</p>

<p>After seeing each appartment <br/>
we returned to Boston where we held meeting which <br/>
was addressed by [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]]<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith</p>

<p>Next day ^23rd^ I called upon brother<br/>
Heber C. Kimball who let me have one hundred dollars <br/>
on P. P. Pratts act to purchse paper with; and on the same <br/>
day started per rail to [[Westfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts|Westfield]] and when <strike>we</strike> ^I^<br/>
got to my destination for the day I found that <br/>
P. P. Pratt and [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] were in the car before <br/>
me without our knowing it. I parted with them <br/>
and they continued homeward</p>

<p>I continued my journey the next <br/>
day ^24th^ and on the following I reached [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]<br/>
my native place and four days later again <br/>
left my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]'s house and arrived in [[New York|New York]]<br/>
on the next day where I found Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]].</p>

<p>On the 3rd of October I took <br/>
steamboat to [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and in the evening <br/>
there met five of the quorum of the Twelve and <br/>
other Elders</p>

<p>Next day the others of the quorum <br/>
of the Twelve started for [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] I also left for <br/>
home on the following day and a large number of <br/>
the Saints started per rail from Philadelphia in <br/>
the morning bound for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]].</p>",

<p>On my journey homeward I made large purchases of <br/>
paper &amp;c at</p>

<p>An Exciting Part of My Journey.</p>

<p>The 19th was one of the most exciting and dangerous day's <br/>
journey possible in any persons life and the scenes through <br/>
which we passed was full of the grand and awful</p>

<p>Our boat was drawn out of the canal on <br/>
cars prepared to run ^on^ the railroad to convey us over the [[Allegheny Mountains, United States|Allegany <br/>
mountain]]</p>

<p>It was a novel scene indeed to see a canal <br/>
boat taken apart into four sections loaded with freights and <br/>
passengers and hoisted ^on^ a railroad by incline plains into the <br/>
air 1500 feet over the highest mountains and then descend <br/>
into the valley below in the same way</p>

<p>^On starting^ Horses were hitched to our cars and they drew <br/>
us four miles and a half and then we were at the first incline <br/>
plain which we had to as<strike>s</strike>cend. Two cars were fastened <br/>
at the tope of the plain to the same rope that connected <br/>
with ours at the bottom and the engine was stationed <br/>
in a building at the sum<strike>i</strike>mit of the plain which <br/>
drew up and let down the cars</p>

<p>When all was ready the signal <br/>
was given by raising a red flag the engine was <br/>
put in motion and the cars started. The first <br/>
plain was half a mile long and raised one hundred <br/>
and eighty feet. We went up in two minutes <br/>
and I was thankful to reach the top for had <br/>
the rope broke or the fastning become untied we <br/>
should have rolled back to the bottom with a tremendious <br/>
crash</p>

<p>Plain No 2 raised 125 feet in half <br/>
a mile and our boat rocked badly while going up <br/>
but no accident hapened. We then continued on</p>",
42828.0,434,,"<p>a level until we came to the next incline plain.</p>

<p>Plain No 3. was one mile and a quarter <br/>
long and it rose 320 feet which we ascended in four <br/>
minutes. Before we reached the top the safty car<br/>
which was attached to our boat was thrown from <br/>
the track <strike><span class=""unclear"">[which]</span></strike> ^and^ dragged many rods throwing the <br/>
rope off the wheels. I made a sign to the <br/>
engineer who stoped and it was replaced. Here <br/>
again we were in danger of breaking the rope which <br/>
would have sent us back down the mountain more <br/>
than a mile or turned us over into the yawing<br/>
gulf below. In either case we should have <br/>
been dashed to atoms. My hair rose on my <br/>
head but having got all things ready we proceeded <br/>
on to Plain No 4.</p>

<p>This plain was three quarters <br/>
of a mile long and ascended 265 feet. We <br/>
reached the surmount of this in three minutes but <br/>
it looked awful to be thus suspended almost <br/>
in the air with such a weight of lives and freight <br/>
depending upon a know, a rope, a pin, an <br/>
engine and the care of a man which should either <br/>
give way would have dashed us to atoms unles<br/>
saved by a miracle</p>

<p>We next continued on to Plain<br/>
No 5 which was 3/4 of a mile long and rose 280 feet <br/>
This we ascended also in three minutes wihch <br/>
brought us on to the Summit of the [[Allegheny Mountains, United States|Allegany <br/>
mountains]] four miles from the base and eleven <br/>
hundred and seventy feet in height.</p>

<p>I felt thankful to God that <br/>
we were on the top of the mountain alive but <br/>
we had to descend in the same way that we <br/>
ascended. There was snow on the Summit and it was <br/>
exceedingly cold. We ran on the top of the mountain <br/>
about three miles and then began to descend</p>

<p>There were six incline plains <br/>
to descend to the bottom of the mountain the </p>",
42828.0,435,,"<p>427</p>

<p>whole of which was attended with equal danger and carelessness</p>

<p>As we came upon the brink of one of them <br/>
it was found the men had left the breakers and the cars <br/>
were about to run down the horses. The conducter seeing <br/>
this followed for the men to break but finding no one at the breakers<br/>
and the cars approaching the incline plain the teamster <br/>
liberated his horses as soon as possible and they only just <br/>
escaped being run down and the conductor sprang to the <br/>
breaker himself and with great exertion barely saved us from <br/>
madly running down the plain and being dashed to atoms</p>

<p>I was standing in the cars at the <br/>
time and instantly throwing off my cloak prepared myself <br/>
for leaping out in case the cars should start down the <br/>
plain. In either case it might have killed me but <br/>
I knew it was certain death to be dashed downward and <br/>
close the alternative of a desperate chance in leaping out <br/>
but through the mercy of God we were stoped at the <br/>
very brink</p>

<p>The whole passage across the mountains<br/>
was a constant scene of danger and I called upon God <br/>
in my heart to preserve my life</p>

<p>Even while on a level we were running <br/>
on the edge of a precipice hundreds of feet deep over <br/>
which if a wheel had broken or run off the track the <br/>
cars would have plunged awfully down and made an <br/>
end of all flesh on board.</p>

<p>We passed through one tunnel in the <br/>
mountain and when we reached the bottom of the incline <br/>
plains I felt thankful to God that we were mostly <br/>
out of danger but the^y^ put the boat together and started <br/>
on the rail with all on board without horse or steam<br/>
and the railroad being a little on the descent it increased <br/>
in speed until it ran at a rapid rate and we <br/>
were still in danger of being upset. The train ran <br/>
of itself for about four miles until it came to the <br/>
canal and here again to finish the day with <br/>
danger a train of cars was left in our track and <br/>
with all the power that could be exerted on the breaks</p>",
42828.0,436,,"<p>we just escaped a smash up at last. We finally got <br/>
launched into the water again with no bones broken or <br/>
lives lost. In conversing <strike>to</strike> ^with^ the mate in the evening<br/>
upon the subject of our passage across the mountains <br/>
he remarked we were not sensible of one half <br/>
the danger we had passed during the day but for <br/>
one I was sensible of a great deal at least</p>

<p>Two days after this we arrived <br/>
at [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] and I immediately engaged passage <br/>
for myself and freight of paper to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis]] started <br/>
the same day and met Elder [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] at <br/>
[[Beaver, Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Bever]] with a company of 50 Saints bound for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
Next day they took passage on the North Bend<br/>
and on the Alps</p>

<p>Passing over farther intermediates<br/>
of my journey I arrived in St Louis re-shipped<br/>
my freight and reached Nauvoo on the 4th of <br/>
November and never felt anyone more thankful <br/>
to tread its soil again than myself.</p>

<p>The week after my arrival home <br/>
I spent in looking after my affairs and found them <br/>
in a bad condition. My house which I commenced <br/>
before I left and expected to find reared and with <br/>
its roof on I found built only a few feet from <br/>
the ground</p>

<p>On the 7th I attended Council <br/>
with the Twelve and was appointed with [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] as a committee <br/>
to raise five hundred dollars to purchase paper <br/>
to print the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.</p>

<p>In the High Council on the case of [[William Henry Harrison Sagers|Harrison Sagers]]<br/>
for improper conduct offered to a female Joseph in an address<br/>
said ""the Church has not received any license from him <br/>
to commit adultery fornication or any such thing but to <br/>
the contrary. If any man commits adultery he cannot<br/>
receive the celestial Kingdom of God. Even if he is saved <br/>
in any Kingdom it could not be in the Celestial Kingdom.""</p>

<p>He said he thought the many who had <br/>
been made examples such as [[John Cook Bennett|John C. Bennet]] and others<br/>
was sufficient to show the heineous fallacy of such conduct<br/>
He condemned it in unqualified terms and warned those <br/>
present against such evils or they would surely bring a <br/>
curse upon the heads of the guilty.</p>

<p>Joseph afterwards met with the Twelve<br/>
and he informed us that [[General Fryson|General Fryeson]] was in town and <br/>
wished an interview with us. He had come for the <br/>
purpose of getting a memorial on our belief written to Congress<br/>
Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] with the quorum of the Twelve <br/>
sat in Council with the General and there were read <br/>
to him the affidavits of Hyrum Smith [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>

<p>On the Sabbath morning Dec 2<sup>nd</sup><br/>
P. P. Pratt [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] Wilford Woodruff and [[Orson Spencer|O Spencer]]<br/>
received their anointings preparatory to further endowment</p>

<p>On the 7th a messenger arrived <br/>
from [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis]] informing us that the [[Thomas Reynolds|Governor]] of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
has issued another writ for Joseph and that he was about <br/>
to make a demand for him of the [[Thomas Ford|governor]] of [[Illinois|Illinois]]</p>

<p>Joseph had just made a touching appeal <br/>
to the Green Mountain Boys of [[Vermont|Vermont]] for assistance<br/>
in obtaining redress of his wrongs in the persecution <br/>
in Missouri. We published it in pamplet form and </p>",
42828.0,438,,"<p>sent it to the authorities of the United States</p>

<p>The City Council <strike>was</strike> <strike>^and^</strike> called <strike>to</strike> ^and^ passed an <br/>
ordinance the purport of which was that anyone henceforth <br/>
who should come to take [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] on the old <br/>
Missourian difficulties should be imprisoned in the<br/>
city jail for life unless pardoned by the Governor <br/>
with the consent of the mayor. This was published <br/>
in an extra sheet of the Neighbours</p>

<p>A few days after this a man by <br/>
the name of Elliot one of the Missourian Kidnappers <br/>
who had ran bretheren out of [[Illinois|Illinois]] to [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
and put them in prison was brought to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
on a warrant and bound under 3000 dollars bonds <br/>
He was also under another warrant for threatening <br/>
the life of Joseph and the charge was proved <br/>
against him but the Prophet forgave him <br/>
and he was discharged. On the case of Joseph made <br/>
an eloquent speech manifesting mercy towards his <br/>
enemies when they were in his power but with <br/>
uplifted hands he declared that if Missouri <br/>
came against us any more he would fight them <br/>
and defend his rights</p>

<p>A warrant was also issued <br/>
against Col [[Levi Williams|Williams]] who was the leader of the <br/>
kidnapping affray but he had gathered around <br/>
him a mob and swore defiance so the officers <br/>
returned to Nauvoo for Counsel and assistance</p>

<p>On the 23rd At President Joseph Smith's <br/>
I wish my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] met with the quorum through <br/>
the day in the endowments. [[Isaac Morley|Brother]] and <br/>
Sister [[Lucy Gunn Morley|Morley]] [[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]] &amp; Sisters [[Permelia Darrow Lott|Lot]] [[Fanny Young Carr Murray|Fanny Murry]]<br/>
Phebe W. Woodruff [[Bathsheba Wilson Bigler Smith|Barsheba Smith]] [[Catherine Curtis Spencer|sister O Spencer]] &amp; [[Sally Waterman Phelps|Phelps]]<br/>
received their anointing.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards was Christmas <br/>
day A large party met at the Nauvoo Mansion <br/>
and had a splendid dinner and supper; but <br/>
I was invited by Elder [[Randolph Alexander|Alexander]] to meet at his <br/>
house with my family and spend the day with</p>",

<p>the [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] Saints. I did so and there were with <br/>
us brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] and his family.</p>

<p>The farther duties of a few days more in <br/>
my official calling and in attending to my family affairs <br/>
and forwarding the building of my house brought <br/>
us to the close of the year</p>

who had been driven from place to place yet <br/>
they felt well, &amp; were not Discouraged but felt to <br/>
trust in God. The Saints felt Determined to ^try to^ build<br/>
up a City where ever they went. Commerce was beautiful<br/>
for situation yet there was but two or three buildings <br/>
in the town. After spending a short time visiting old<br/>

And He took the sick by the hand &amp; in a loud voice<br/>
commanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ to <br/>
arise &amp; be made whole &amp; the healed all that were <br/>
in his house &amp; around about He then took some <br/>
of the Twelve with him &amp; walked up the River bank<br/>
about a mile &amp; healing all that were sick as he went <br/>
along &amp; thy were may among the Number was Elder <br/>
[[Henry Garlick Sherwood|Sherwood]] who lay at the point of Death. He crossed <br/>
the River to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa|Montrose]] went into the Home where [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]] lay sick &amp; healed him, who walked out of the <br/>
Home &amp; followed him. The prophet came to where I was <br/>
standing &amp; told me to follow him I did so we <br/>
then went into the Home of Elijah Fordham who <br/>
was at the point of Death, his friends had looked <br/>
for him to breath his Last for several hours. He <br/>
had lost his speech &amp; nearly his breath. We walked<br/>
into the room <strike>Brother</strike> The prephet Joseph took brother<br/>
Fordham by the Hand &amp; looking the dying man in <br/>
the Eyes for several moments. He them said Brother Fordham^,^<br/>
in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I comnd<br/>
you to arise &amp; be made whole. The voice of the prophet <br/>
was like the voice of God it seemed as though the whole <br/>
Home shook from its very foundation And the man <br/>
leaped from his bed &amp; was made whole instaneously <br/>
He kicked his pettiees off from his feet, dressed himself <br/>
Eat a Roll of bread &amp; milk &amp; followed us out of the House <br/>

very sick the prophet Healed him &amp; we knelt down &amp; pryd <br/>
&amp; gve thanks to God. The wicked became alarmed at the seeing<br/>
the power of God and follow to see what the end would<br/>
be After the propht Had healed, all the sick saints in <br/>

of which were vary sick.  He said I cannot go but <br/>
I will send a man, who will do just as well.  <strike>He</strike> <br/>

me that there would be a great work in London<br/>

about 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a Determina-<br/>

the powers of darkness which were besetting us day by <br/>

unto me which I considered was the prince of <strike>Darknss</strike><br/>

why do you not pr[a]y, &amp; call upon the Lord for help.  I them <br/>
asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to deliver <br/>
me from the powers of the Devil &amp; preseve my life<br/>

the twinkling of an Eye I was liberated &amp; the spirit of God <br/>
vibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the souls<br/>

<p>CHAPTER III.<br/>
Utah obtains an Historical Importance through her Commercial Men.</p>

<p>IT was the merchants of Utah who first brought the Mormon community fairly into socialistic importance. And this affirmation is true of them, both in their results at home and in the influence which they excercised abroad for the good of the people and the glory of Utah. Moreover, in the general sense of the public weal, this affirmation is as true of the Walker Brothers and Godbe and Lawrence, as it is of Jennings and Hooper or Elredge and Clawson. The very construction of society and the necessities and aims of commerce convert the enterprises and life work of this class of men into the public good. Over a quarter of a century, for instance, the Walker Brothers and Godbe and Lawrence have been identified with the material prosperity and destiny of this Territory. The welfare of the country is their own good as a class ;---the glory of the commonwealth glorifies their houses and augments their own fortunes. Of all men, the life-work and enterprise of the class who establish commerce, build railroads, develop the native mineral resources of the country, and construct the financial power of the State, must per force tend to the public prosperity as well as conserving and preserving society. And if this is the case with those influential men of commerce and great enterprises who have gone outside of the pale of the Church, yet are still identified with the community in all their essential interests, how much more, specially speaking, is it the case with those men who have remained inside the pale of the Church and built up her commercial and financial power? The Church owes to her apostles of commerce and finance more than many would like to confess ; and yet in this point of their extraordinary service to the Church is at once the significance and potency of ""Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution."" This will be strikingly illustrated in the circumstantial history of ""Z. C. M. I.,"" towards which we are traveling in these preperatory commercial views. <br/>
Often has it been told what the community has done for the merchants, and as often have those same merchants---who built up the commercial and financial power of the Church---been ungraciously twitted that they have made their money out of ""this people."" Let us look at the other side now, and ask something of what the merchants have done for the community, and what ""this people"" have made out of the merchants? And this line of review of our commercial history is very necessary to be understood insomuch as it will be suggestive of what the community already owe to the existence of ""Z. C. M. I."" And, furthermore, the remarkably successful example of that unique Institution during the last twelve years, under the united incorporation of these apostles temporal with the apostles spiritual, will foreshadow the vast results which the community will derive in the future in the growth and augmentation of the power and resources of said Institution.<br/>
A cursory view has been given of the destitute condition of the Mormon people during the first period of the settlement of these Valleys. As late as 1856, there was a famine in Utah, and the community was barely preserved by the leaders wisely rationing the whole and dividing among the people their own substance. But it was neither the economy and wisdom of the leaders, nor the plentiful harvests that followed, that redeemed Utah from the depths of her poverty, and the anomalous isolation of a people reared in lands of civilization and plenty. She was redeemed from her social destitution by a train of Providential circumstances on the one hand, and the extraordinary activities of her merchants on the other. As we have seen, the Providence came in a United States Army ; the temporary existence of Camp Floyd ; the departure of the troops, leaving their substance to the community; the needs of the Overland Mail line ; the construction of the telegraph lines ; and then again the arrival of another U. S. army under Colonel Connor, and the establishment of Camp Douglas with several thousand soldiers to disburse their money in Salt Lake City after their pay days, besides the constant supplies which the camp needed from our country, and often labor from our citizens.

<p>UTAH'S COMMERCE AND CO-OPERATION.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>THE INITIAL VIEW OF OUR COMMERCE.</p>

<p>THE history of Utah commerce is<br/>
very unique.  In some respects,<br/>
there is not a State or Territory in<br/>
America whose commercial history will<br/>
compare with that of our Territory.  Its<br/>
character has been as peculiar as its com-<br/>
monwealth, and that has given to it a<br/>
typing quite uncommon in it genius;<br/>
yet the typing in accord with the co-op-<br/>
erative policies which the age has de-<br/>
vised in solving the problem between<br/>
capital and labor.  There is also much<br/>
stirring romance in its history.  Its<br/>
story and incidents are almost as roman-<br/>
tic as the commerce of Arabia whose<br/>
mammoth caravans, in their journeys<br/>
acr ss the deserts, have given subject and<br/>
narrative to the most gorgeous romances<br/>
in the whole range of literature.  The<br/>
journeys of the trains of these merchants<br/>
of the West over the Rocky Mountains <br/>
and the vast arid plains between Salt<br/>
Lake City and the Eastern States, and<br/>
their arduous task and adventurous ex-<br/>
periences will fitly compare with the his-<br/>
tory of the merchants of the East in old-<br/>
en times when civilization herself was<br/>
fostered by commerce; and, moreover,<br/>
in the early days of Utah, it took as<br/>
much commercial courage, perseverance<br/>
and ability to establish the commerce of<br/>
this Territory as it did that of any na-<br/>
tion known in history.  On the very<br/>
face of the record, we may discern that<br/>
the men who did this work were no or-<br/>
dinary men.  They were capable of mak-<br/>
ing their mark in any land; and if Utah,<br/>
in the early days, afforded them great op-<br/>
portunities, it was their boundless ener-<br/>
gies and commercial ambitions that first<br/>
created those opportunities and made a<br/>
people comparatively affluent who had<br/>
been buried in isolation and in the<br/>
depths of poverty.  Thus considered,<br/>
45<br/>
the biographies of our commercial men<br/>
have a peculiar charm of interest which<br/>
gives a dignity to the personal record of<br/>
their lives far above that of the ordinary<br/>
history of self-made men and successful<br/>
financiers.  Indeed, the history of our<br/>
commercial men is substantially the his-<br/>
tory of Utah commerce.</p>

<p>But the initial exposition of Utah com-<br/>
merce is undoubtedly that derived from <br/>
her peculiar commonwealth, and the ex-<br/>
traordinary history of the Mormon peo-<br/>
ple who settled these valleys; and this<br/>
will lead us directly through various<br/>
phases of development to the commercial<br/>
culmination to be illustrated in ""Zion's<br/>
Co-operative Mercantile Institution.""<br/>
To type our commercial history for the<br/>
popular understanding, it may be de-<br/>
scribed as Israelitish; and so its char-<br/>
acteristic inscription of ""Holiness to the <br/>
Lord"" is neither fanciful nor presumptu-<br/>
ous, but fundamental and typical.  It<br/>
may be confessed that the inscription has<br/>
been often burlesqued by the ""Gentile;""<br/>
but the sociologist would quickly read in<br/>
it a volume concerning the genius and<br/>
commonwealth of a people expressed in<br/>
a gigantic commercial institution which,<br/>
in its vast activities, influence and special<br/>
methods, may become famous as the<br/>
greatest marvel in the history of modern<br/>
commerce.</p>

<p>And, just in this initial view, we must<br/>
keep in sight the men who founded the<br/>
Institution and especially those who are<br/>
the proper representatives of the com-<br/>
merce of the Mormon people.  It would<br/>
be a very false-sighted view to consider<br/>
""Z. C. M. I."" as a colossal commer-<br/>
cial monument of the Church apart from<br/>
those commercial founders.  That insti-<br/>
tution, in fine, is the organic embodi-<br/>
ment of the life-activities of such men as<br/>
William Jennings, William H. Hooper, <br/>
Horace S. Eldredge, Hyrum B. Clawson,<br/>
William C. Staines, Godbe and Mitchell</p>",

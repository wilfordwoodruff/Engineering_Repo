<p>CHAPTER VI.<br/>
DESCRIPTION OF [[Vinalhaven, Waldo County, Maine|VINAL HAVEN]]—POPULATION AND PURSUIT <br/>
OF THE PEOPLE—GREAT VARIETY OF FISH—THE IN-<br/>
TRODUCTION OF THE GOSPEL.</p>

<p>THE town of Vinal Haven includes both [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North]] and [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South <br/>
Fox Islands]], in lat. 44° north, and long. 69° 10' east. <br/>
The population numbered, at the time of my visit, about <br/>
1,800.  The inhabitants were intelligent and industrious, and <br/>
hospitable to strangers. They got most of their wealth and <br/>
living by fishing. The town fitted out over one hundred <br/>
licensed sailing vessels, besides smaller craft.</p>

<p>North Fox Island is nine miles long by two miles in width <br/>
and had a population of 800. They had a post office, one <br/>
store, a [[Baptist|Baptist]] church and meeting-house, four school-houses<br/>
and a tide grist mill.</p>

<p>The land was rather poor, yet there were some good farms. <br/>
The products where wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and grass. <br/>
The principal timber was fir, spruce, hemlock and birch. <br/>
Raspberries and gooseberries grew in great abundance, and <br/>
some up-land cranberries were raised. The principal stock of <br/>
the island were sheep.</p>

<p>South Fox Island comes as near being without any definite <br/>
form as any spot on earth I ever saw. It would be difficult <br/>
for any person to describe it. It is about ten miles in length <br/>
by five in width, and is one universal mass of rocks, formed <br/>
into shelves, hills, and valleys, and cut up into necks and points <br/>
to make room for the coves and harbors that run through and <br/>
through the island.</p>

<p>The population was 1,000. The inhabitants got their living <br/>
entirely by fishing. There is no chance for farming upon the <br/>
island, and but a few garden patches, which are cultivated at <br/>
great expense. Some few sheep are raised there.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants fish in the region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], <br/>
and bring their fish home and cure them on flakes and prepare</p>",

<p>them for the market. They supply the market with great <br/>
quantities of cod, mackerel and boxed herring.</p>

<p>Upon this [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|island]] there were two stores, three tide saw mills, <br/>
six school houses and a small branch of the [[Methodist|Methodist]] church, <br/>
presided over by a priest.</p>

<p>What timber there is upon this island, such as pine, fir, <br/>
spruce, hemlock and birch, and the whortleberries, rasp-<br/>
berries and gooseberries, mostly grow out of the <br/>
cracks of the rocks.</p>

<p>Great quantities of fish, and in almost endless variety, <br/>
inhabit the coves and harbors around the islands. The whale, <br/>
blackfish, shark, ground shark, pilot-fish, horse mackerel, <br/>
sturgeon, salmon, halibut, cod, pollock, tom cod, hake, had-<br/>
dock, mackerel, shad bass, alewife, herring, pohagen, <br/>
dolphin, whiting, frost-fish, flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, <br/>
skid, cusk, blueback, scallop, dogfish, muttonfish, lumpfish, <br/>
squid, five-fingers, monkfish, horsefish, sunfish, swordfish, <br/>
thrasher, cat, scuppog, tootog, eye fish, cunner, ling, also the <br/>
eel, lobster, clam, muscle, periwinkle, porpoise, seal, etc., are <br/>
found there.</p>

<p>Thus I have given a brief description of Vinal Haven. It <br/>
was quite dark when we landed there, without a farthing in <br/>
money. We made our way over the rocks and through the <br/>
cedars the best way we could, until we found a house, when <br/>
we rapped at the door, A woman put her head out of the <br/>
window and asked who was there and what was wanted.</p>

<p>I told her we were two strangers, and wanted a bed to lie <br/>
down upon until morning.</p>

<p>She let us in and gave us a bed, and we slept until quite <br/>
late, it being Sunday morning. When we came out and took <br/>
breakfast it was nearly noon. I asked her what she charged <br/>
for our entertainment, and she replied that we were welcome.</p>

<p>I then asked her if there was any religion or minister or <br/>
church on the island.</p>

<p>She informed me there was a [[Baptist|Baptist]] minister, by the name <br/>
of [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], who had a congregation and a meeting-house about <br/>
five miles from there.</p>

<p>We thanked her for her kindness, walked to the meeting-<br/>
house and stepped inside the doorway. We stood there until</p>",
671.0,44,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>a deacon came to the door, when I asked him to go and tell <br/>
the [[Gideon J. Newton|minister]] in the pulpit that there were two servants of <br/>
God at the door, who had a message to deliver to that people <br/>
and wished the privilege of delivering it.</p>

<p>He sent for us to come to the pulpit, so we walked through <br/>
the congregation with our valises under our arms, and took <br/>
a seat by the side of the minister, who was about to speak as <br/>
we came to the door.</p>

<p>He arose and delivered his discourse to the people, occupy-<br/>
ing about half an hour. When he closed he asked me what <br/>
was my wish.</p>

<p>I told him we wished to speak to the people at any hour <br/>
that would suit his or their convenience; so he gave notice <br/>
that there were two strangers present who would speak to the <br/>
people at five o'clock that evening.</p>

<p>We were quite a source of wonderment to the people, as they <br/>
had no idea who we were.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton asked us home to tea with him, and we gladly <br/>
accepted the invitation. When we arrived at his house I <br/>
opened my valise and took out the [[Bible|Bible]], [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] <br/>
and [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and Covenants]], laid them upon the table, and <br/>
took my seat.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton took up the books and looked at them, but <br/>
said nothing. I then asked him if there were any school-<br/>
houses upon the island, and if so, whether they were free to <br/>
preach in.</p>

<p>He answered that there were four, numbered respectively <br/>
from one to four, and that they were free.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton and family accompanied us to the meeting-<br/>
house, where we met a large congregation, none of whom <br/>
knew who we were or anything about our profession, except <br/>
the minister.</p>

<p>Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] and I went into the stand, and I arose with <br/>
peculiar feelings, and addressed the congregation for one hour,<br/>
taking for my text <i>##Galatians 1:8-9|Galatians i</i>. 89.##</p>

<p>This was the first time that I or any other Elder of the <br/>
[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] had (to my <br/>
knowledge) attempted to preach the fullness of the gospel and <br/>
the Book of Mormon to the inhabitants of any island of the sea.</p>",
671.0,45,1837-09-03,"<p>BEGIN TO BAPTIZE THE PEOPLE.</p>

<p>I had much liberty in speaking, and informed the people <br/>

Church as in the days of Christ and the ancient apostles, with <br/>
prophets, apostles and the gifts as anciently, and that He had <br/>
brought forth the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]].</p>

<p>At the close of my remarks Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] bore testimony.</p>

<p>I gave liberty for anyone to speak that might wish to. As <br/>
no one responded, I announced that we would hold meetings <br/>
the next four evenings in the school-houses, beginning at No. 1.</p>

DOUGLASS' FLOCK—GREAT NUMBER OF ISLANDS—BOILED <br/>
CLAMS—DAY OF PRAYER—CODFISH FLAKES.</p>

<p>DURING the first thirteen days of our sojourn upon the <br/>
island we preached seventeen discourses, being invited by <br/>
the people to tarry with them. I left a copy of the [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine <br/>
and Covenants]] with Mr. Newton for his perusal.</p>

<p>He read it, and the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] bore testimony to him of <br/>
its truth. He pondered over it for days, and he walked his <br/>
room until midnight trying to decide whether to receive or reject it.</p>

<p>He and his family attended about a dozen of my first meet-<br/>
ings, and then he made up his mind, contrary to the dictation <br/>
of the Spirit of God to him, to reject the testimony, and <br/>
come out against me. However, we commenced baptizing his flock.</p>

<p>The first two we baptized were a sea captain, by the name <br/>
of [[Justus Ames|Justin Eames]], and his [[Betsey Hudson Ames|wife]]. Brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan H. Hale]] <br/>
went down into the sea and baptized them on the <time datetime=""",09/03/1837
671.0,45,,""">3rd of Sep-</time></p>",
671.0,46,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL</p>

<p><sup>t</sup>ember, and these were the first baptisms performed by proper <br/>
authority upon any of the islands of the sea (to my know-<br/>
ledge) in this dispensation.</p>

<p>Before we left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] some of the leading apostates there <br/>
had tried to discourage Brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] about going upon his <br/>
mission, telling him he would never baptize any one, and he <br/>
had better remain at home. When Captain [[Justus Ames|Eames]] offered <br/>
himself for baptism, I told Brother Hale to go and baptize <br/>
him, and prove those men [[false prophets|false prophets]], and he did so.</p>

<p>On the following Sabbath I baptized his brother, [[Ebenezer Ames|Ebenezer <br/>
Eames]], another sea captain, and a [[Melana Ames Dyer|young lady]].</p>

<p>Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], the Baptist minister, now commenced a war <br/>
against us, and sent to the [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Island]] for a Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]], a <br/>
[[Methodist|Methodist]] minister (with whom he had been at variance for <br/>
years) to come over and help him put down ""Mormonism.""</p>

<p>Mr. Douglass came over, and they got as many people together <br/>
as they could and held a conference. He railed against <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], the prophet, and the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], and, taking <br/>
that book in his hand, with out-stretched arm, declared that <br/>
he feared none of the judgments of God that would come upon <br/>
him for rejecting it as the word of God. (I never heard what <br/>
his sentiments upon this subject were at the end of his term of <br/>
fourteen years' imprisonment in the [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] Penitentiary, <br/>
for an outrage upon his daughter, the judgment of which <br/>
was given upon the testimony of his wife and daughter.)</p>

<p>I was present and heard Mr. Douglass' speech upon this <br/>
occasion and took minutes of the same. When he closed I <br/>
arose and informed the people that I would meet with them <br/>
next Sunday in the meeting-house, and answer Mr. Douglass, <br/>
and wished him as well as the people to be present.</p>

<p>I informed the people that Mr. Douglass had made many <br/>
false statements against Joseph Smith and the Latter-day <br/>
Saints, with whom he had no acquaintance, and he had mis-<br/>
quoted much scripture, all of which I could correct.</p>

<p>We continued to baptize the people on the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Island]] <br/>
until we had baptized every person who owned an interest in the <br/>
Baptist meeting-house. I then followed Mr. Douglass home <br/>
to the South Island and preached the gospel to and baptized <br/>
nearly all the members of his church.</p>",
671.0,47,1837-09-17,"<p>GREAT EXCITEMENT UPON BOTH [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|ISLANDS]].</p>

<p>The excitement became great upon both Fox Islands islands, and on <br/>
Sunday, the <time datetime=""",09/17/1837
671.0,47,,""">17th of September</time>, I met a large assembly from <br/>
both Islands, and took the same subject that Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]] <br/>
had dwelt upon in his remarks against the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] <br/>
and our principles.</p>

<p>I spoke two-and-a-half hours, and answered every objection <br/>
against the Book of Mormon, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] or our prin-<br/>
ciples.</p>

<p>I had good attention, and the people seemed satisfied. At <br/>
the close of the meeting Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] administered the ordin-<br/>
ance of baptism.</p>

<p>Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], in order to save his cause, went to the main-<br/>
land and brought over several ministers with him and held a <br/>
protracted meeting. They hoped by this to stop the work of <br/>
God, but all to no avail, for the whole people would attend <br/>
our meeting and receive the word of God, and we continued <br/>
to baptize.</p>

<p>We visited the dwellings of most of the inhabitants during <br/>
our sojourn there.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion, while standing upon Mr. [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Carver's]] farm <br/>
on the east end of the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Island]], we counted fifty-five <br/>
islands in that region, the majority of which were not inhabit-<br/>
ed. We also saw twenty ships under sail at the same time.</p>

<p>We had no lack for food while upon the island, for if we did <br/>
not wish to trouble our friends for a dinner, we only had to <br/>
borrow a spade or a hoe and a kettle and go to the beach and <br/>
dig a peck of clams. These, when boiled, would make a <br/>
delicious meal, which we often availed ourselves of.</p>

<p>One day, Elder Hale and I ascended to the top of a high <br/>
granite rock upon the [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Island]], for prayer and supplic-<br/>
ation. We sat down under the shade of a pine tree which <br/>
grew out of a fissure in the rock, and Elder Hale read the<br/>
##Jeremiah 16:16|16th chapter## of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], where mention is made of the <br/>
hunters and fishers that God would send in the last days to <br/>
gather Israel.</p>

<p>Of a truth here we were upon an Island of the sea, standing <br/>
upon a rock where we could survey the gallant ships and also <br/>
the islands, which were as full of rocks, ledges and caves as <br/>
any part of the earth. And what had brought us here? To</p>",
671.0,48,1837-09-06,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>search out the [[blood of Ephraim|blood of Ephraim]], the honest and meek of the <br/>
earth, and gather them from those islands, rocks, holes and <br/>
caves of the earth unto Zion.</p>

<p>We prayed, and rejoiced together. The Spirit of God <br/>
rested upon us; we spoke of Christ and the ancient prophets <br/>
and apostles in [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]; of [[Nephi (BofM)|Nephi]], [[Alma (BofM)|Alma]], [[Mormon (BofM)|Mormon]] and <br/>
[[Moroni (BofM)|Moroni]] in America; [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver]] and the apostles <br/>
in our own day, and we rejoiced that we were upon the islands <br/>
of the sea searching out the blood of Israel.</p>

<p>While being filled with these meditations and the Spirit of <br/>
God, we fell upon our knees and gave thanks to the God of <br/>
heaven, and felt to pray for all Israel.</p>

<p>After spending most of the day in praise and thanksgiving, <br/>
we descended to the settlement and held a meeting with the <br/>
people.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",09/06/1837
671.0,48,1837-10-02,""">6th of September</time> we called upon Captain [[Benjamin Coombs|Benjamin <br/>
Coombs]], and visited his flakes, where he had one thousand <br/>
quintals of codfish drying for the market. They had mostly <br/>
been caught in the region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. While we were <br/>
passing [[Carvey|Carvey's Wharf]] our attention was called to a large <br/>
school of mackerel playing by the side of the wharf. Several <br/>
men were pitching them out with hooks. We also flung in a <br/>
hook and caught all we wanted, then went on our way.</p>

<p>I told him what class of men asked for signs, and that he <br/>
was a wicked and adulterous man, and predicted that the curse <br/>
of God would rest upon him, and that his wickedness would <br/>
be made manifest in the eyes of the people. (While visiting <br/>
these islands several years afterwards I learned that the pre-<br/>
diction had really been fulfilled, and that he was serving out a <br/>
fourteen years' term of imprisonment for a beastly crime).</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodruff crossed the thoroughfare in a boat and <br/>
walked ten miles, the length of the island, to meet me, on the <br/>
last day of the year. I held a meeting the same day in the <br/>

giving way, and the power of God was manifest by signs fol-<br/>

<p>I spent this New Year's Day visiting the Saints and their <br/>
neighbors, and met a congregation at Captain [[Charles Brown|Chas. Brown’s]], <br/>
where I spoke to them for a while, and at the close of my <br/>
remarks led three persons down into the sea and baptized <br/>
them. Two of these were sea captains, namely, Charles <br/>
Brown, and [[Jesse Coombs|Jesse Coombs]], and the third was the [[Desire Harding Coombs|wife]] of Cap-<br/>

seed I had sown was bringing forth fruit. Six persons were <br/>
ready for baptism.</p>

<p>But my mission upon these islands was not an exception to <br/>
the general rule: success did not come without many obstacles <br/>
presenting themselves. Those who rejected the word were <br/>
frequently inspired by the evil one to make an attempt at per-<br/>
secution.</p>

<p>Some of those who felt to oppose me went down to the har-<br/>
bor and got a swivel and small arms, and planted them close <br/>
by the school-house, near the sea shore, and while I was <br/>
speaking they commenced firing their cannon and guns. I <br/>
continued speaking in great plainness, but my voice was <br/>
mingled with the report of musketry.</p>

<p>I told the people my garments were clear of the blood of <br/>
the inhabitants of that island, and asked if any wished to <br/>
embrace the gospel. Two persons came forward and wished <br/>
to be baptized, and I baptized them.</p>

<p>On the following day when I went down to the seaside to <br/>
baptize a man, the rabble commenced firing guns again, as on <br/>
the previous night. I afterwards learned that notices were <br/>
posted up, warning me to leave the town, but I thought it <br/>
was better to obey God than man, and, therefore, did not go.</p>

had been visited by Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]], who told them that I <br/>
denied the [[Bible|Bible]] and could not be depended upon; and they <br/>
yielded to his insinuations until the [[Devil|devil]] took possession of <br/>
them, and they were in a disaffected condition, and sent for <br/>

returned to [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]]. Here I met Brother James Townsend, <br/>
who had just arrived from [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]].</p>

<p>I ordained Brother Townsend to the office of an Elder, and <br/>
we concluded to take a journey to Bangor, and offer the <br/>
gospel to the inhabitants of that city.</p>

<p>We undertook the journey on foot in the dead of winter, <br/>
when the snow was very deep, and the first day broke the road <br/>
for seven miles to [[Searsmont, Waldo County, Maine|Scarsmont]]. The day following, it being <br/>
Sunday, we held two meetings, preached the gospel to the <br/>
people, and were kindly entertained.</p>

<p>house, and I got one of my ears frozen on the way; but not-<br/>
withstanding the severity of the weather, we had quite a large <br/>
and attentive audience. We also spent the next two days <br/>
with the people there and held meetings.</p>

<p>On the evening of the <time datetime=""",02/21/1838
671.0,53,,""">21st of February</time>, as we came out of <br/>
the school-house, a light appeared in the north-eastern hori-<br/>
zon, and spread to the west and soon rolled over our heads. <br/>
It had the appearance of fire, blood and smoke, and at times <br/>
resembled contending armies. The heavens were illuminated <br/>
for the space of half an hour. It seemed at times as though <br/>
the veil was about to rend in twain and the elements were con-<br/>
tending with each other.</p>

<p>We looked upon it as one of the signs in the heavens pre-<br/>
dicted by the prophets of old, as to appear in the [[last days|last days]]. <br/>
We were wading through deep snowdrifts most of the time <br/>
while witnessing this remarkable scene.*</p>

<p>The following day we walked fifteen miles through deep <br/>
snow to [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], and, after being refused lodging for the night <br/>
by eight families, we were kindly entertained by a Mr. [[Thomas Tapley|Thomas <br/>
Teppley]].</p>

<p>There was an interesting incident connected with our stay at <br/>
his house. After eating our supper, it being late in the even-<br/>
ing, Mr. Teppley placed a stand before me with a [[Bible|Bible]] upon<br/>
it, asking me to read a chapter and have prayers with them, <br/>
he being a religious man.</p>

<p>I opened the Bible mechanically, when, the ##Matthew 25|25th chapter of <br/>
Matthew## being the first to catch my eye, I read it, and as I <br/>
closed the book Mr. Teppley turned to his [[Polly Wentworth Tapley|wife]] and said, ""Is<br/>
not this a strange thing?"" Then he explained to us that he <br/>
had just read that chapter and closed the book when we <br/>
rapped at the door, and he felt impressed to say, "" Walk in, <br/>
gentlemen.""</p>

<p>There is probably no other chapter in the whole book that <br/>
would have the same influence in causing any one to feed a <br/>
person who professed to be a [[servant of God|servant of God]], and asked for <br/>
bread.</p>

<p>After becoming acquainted with his circumstances I thought <br/>
it providential that we were led to his house, for although he <br/>
was a professor of religion and a [[Methodist|Methodist]], he was in a state</p>

<p><i>2</i>*</p>",

<p>of despair, believing that he had committed the unpardonable <br/>
sin.</p>

<p>However, I told him what the [[unpardonable sin|unpardonable sin]] was, and <br/>
that he had not committed it; but that it was a trick of the <br/>
[[Devil|devil]] to make him think so, in order to torment him. He then <br/>
acknowledged that he went down to the wharf a few evenings <br/>
before, with the intention of drowning himself, but when he <br/>
looked into the cold, dark water he desisted and returned <br/>
home, and had said nothing previous to anyone about it.</p>

<p>I taught him the principles of the gospel, which proved a <br/>
comfort to him.</p>

<p>We spent the following day in visiting the people of [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], <br/>
and in the evening preached in a brick school-house, provided <br/>
by Mr. [[Thomas Tapley|Teppley]], and many wished to hear more from us.</p>

<p>We next visited [[Northport, Waldo County, Maine|Northport]] and [[Frankfort, Waldo County, Maine|Frankfort]], holding meetings <br/>
at both places, and on the <time datetime=""",03/01/1838

[[Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine|Bangor]], which at that time had a population of ten thousand. <br/>
This was my [[birthday|birthday]], I being thirty-one years of age.</p>

<p>I visited some of the leading men of Bangor, and they <br/>
granted me the use of the City Hall, where I preached to <br/>
good audiences for two successive evenings. This was the first <br/>
time a Latter-day Saint Elder had preached in that town. <br/>
Many were anxious to learn more about our principles, but <br/>
our visits through all the towns from [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thompaston]] to Bangor <br/>
were necessarily brief, owing to our appointments upon the <br/>
islands. It was like casting our bread upon the waters and <br/>
trusting in God for the result.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",03/05/1838

Saints for prayer and praise before the Lord.</p>

<p>On my arrival I received a package of letters from friends <br/>

[[apostasy|apostasy]] and tribulations which the Saints were passing <br/>

from shore to a sand bar (it being low tide), to dig clams. <br/>
The ground near the shore was much lower than the bar we <br/>
were on, and while we were all busy digging clams and talk-<br/>
ing ""Mormonism,"" the dashing of the waves of the incoming <br/>
tide against the shore suddenly made us conscious that we <br/>
had fifty yards of water between us and the shore.</p>

<p>The surf waves also added to our difficulty, and as we had <br/>
no boat, our only alternative was to cross our four arms, thus <br/>
forming a kind of arm-chair for our wives to sit upon, and <br/>
carry them in turn to the shore, wading through two-and-a-<br/>
half feet of water.</p>

<p>By the time we got our wives and clams safely landed, the <br/>
truth of the maxim was firmly impressed upon our minds, <br/>
that ""Time and tide wait for no man,"" not even for a preacher <br/>
of the gospel.</p>

<p>COUNSELED TO GATHER WITH THE SAINTS—REMARKABLE MANIFESTATION—CASE OF HEALING—EFFORTS OF APOS-<br/>
TATES—VISIT FROM ELDERS—A CONFERENCE—CLOSING <br/>
MY LABORS ON THE [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|ISLANDS]] FOR A SEASON.</p>

<p>ON the <time datetime=""",03/28/1838
671.0,55,,""">28th of March</time> I received a letter from Zion, <br/>
requesting me to counsel the Saints I had baptized to <br/>
sell their property and gather up to Zion.</p>

<p>About this time the Lord was manifesting Himself upon <br/>
the Islands in various ways, by dreams, visions, healings, signs <br/>
and wonders. I will relate one peculiar circumstance of this <br/>
kind that occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Ebenezer Carver]] had been investigating our doctrines <br/>
for quite a length of time, and, having a great desire to know <br/>
the truth of our religion, he walked to the sea shore, wishing <br/>
that he might have some manifestation in proof of its truth.</p>",
671.0,56,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>The passage of scripture came to his mind that there would <br/>
be no sign given ""but the sign of the prophet [[Jonah (OT)|Jonas]],"" and <br/>
while this thought was in his mind a large fish arose to the <br/>
top of the water, a distance from him in the sea, and suddenly <br/>
sank out of sight. He much desired to see it again, and soon <br/>
it arose to the top of the water, accompanied by another fish <br/>
of about the same size, and one of them swam on the water in <br/>
a straight line towards Mr. [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Carver]] as he stood upon the shore. <br/>
It came as near to him as the water would permit, and then <br/>
stopped and gazed at him with a penetrating eye, as though <br/>
it had a message for him. It then returned to its mate in <br/>
the ocean and swam out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Carver retraced his steps homeward, meditating upon <br/>
the scene and the wonderful condescension of the Lord.</p>

<p>It is proper to remark that this was at a season of the year <br/>
when fish of that size are never known upon those shores or <br/>
seas, and they are never, at any season, known to come ashore <br/>
as in the case mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Carver was convinced that it was intended by the Lord <br/>
as a sign to him.</p>

<p>Two days after this event I visited Mr. Carver at his house, <br/>
and found his [[Mary Stinson Carver|wife]] confined to her bed with a fever, and she <br/>
requested me to administer to her. I placed my [[laying on of hands|hands]] upon <br/>
her head, the power of God rested upon me, and I com-<br/>
manded her in the name of Jesus Christ to arise and walk.</p>

<p>She arose and was healed from that instant, and she walked <br/>
down to the sea and I baptized her in the same place where <br/>
the fish visited her husband. I confirmed her there, and she was <br/>
filled with the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] and returned to her home rejoicing.</p>

<p>I now called the people together and exhorted them to sell <br/>
their property and prepare to accompany me to the land of <br/>
Zion. I had labored hard for many days for the temporal <br/>
and spiritual welfare of the inhabitants of those islands, and <br/>
the Lord had blessed my labors and given me many souls as <br/>
seals of my ministry, for which I felt to praise Him; and now <br/>
I felt to labor quite as zealously to gather out those who had <br/>
embraced the gospel, and lead them to Zion.</p>

<p>The worst difficulty which the Saints had to contend with in <br/>
that day was from false brethren. [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]], who had</p>",

me as a missionary, had apostatized and been cut off from the <br/>
Church. Learning that I was building up branches of the <br/>
Church upon the island, he and other apostates conspired to <br/>
block up my way by writing lies to the people and stirring up <br/>
a spirit of mobocracy upon the [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|islands]].</p>

<p>They succeeded in exerting a strong influence with the <br/>
wicked, but I knew they could not hinder the work of God.</p>

up in bitterness against me, the Spirit of God was with me, <br/>
and at the close of the meeting I baptized three persons. <br/>
One of these was Mrs. [[Abigail Waterman Carver|Abigail Carver]], the mother of Eben-<br/>
ezer Carver, who was seventy years of age and in poor health. <br/>
She had not so much as visited a neighbor's house for six <br/>
years, but upon this occasion she walked with boldness to the <br/>
sea shore and I baptized her, and she returned rejoicing.</p>

informed them that the Spirit of God bore record to me that <br/>
it was our duty to leave the islands for a season and take a <br/>

<p>We conversed together for three hours in this solitary <br/>
abode. He informed me of many things which had trans-<br/>
pired while he was confined there as a prisoner. Among <br/>
other things, he mentioned that the jail had taken fire a few <br/>
days previous to my visit. He said it looked a little like a <br/>
dark hour. The fire was roaring over his head, while uproar <br/>
and confusion were upon every hand. Fire engines were <br/>
rapidly playing around the building, with water pouring into <br/>
every room. The people were hallooing in the streets. <br/>
Prisoners were begging for mercy's sake to be let out, or they <br/>
would be consumed in the fire. One was struggling in the <br/>
agonies of death, while others were cursing and swearing. <br/>
Brother Rockwood said he felt composed in the midst of it <br/>
until the fire was extinguished.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the jailor unlocked the prison door to let <br/>
me out, and I gave the parting hand to the prisoner of <br/>
hope.</p>

<p>We had spent a pleasant time together, and he rejoiced at <br/>
my visit; and who would not, to meet with a friend in a lonely <br/>

<p>By the help of God, I preached the gospel faithfully to my <br/>
father's household and to all that were with him, as well as to <br/>
my other relatives, and I had appointed a meeting on Sunday, <br/>
the 1st of July at my father's home.</p>

<p>My father was believing my testimony, as were all in his <br/>
household, but upon this occasion the [[Devil|devil]] was determined <br/>
to hinder the fulfillment of the promise of the patriarch <br/>
unto me.</p>

<p>It seemed as though Lucifer, the son of the morning, had <br/>
gathered together the hosts of hell and exerted his powers <br/>
upon us all. Distress overwhelmed the whole household, and <br/>
all were tempted to reject the work. And it seemed as <br/>
though the same power would devour me. I had to take to <br/>
my bed for an hour before the time of meeting. I there <br/>
prayed unto the Lord with my whole soul for deliverance, for <br/>
I knew the power of the devil was exercised to hinder me <br/>
from accomplishing what God had promised me.</p>",

<p>The Lord heard my prayer and answered my petition, and <br/>
when the hour of meeting had come I arose from my bed, and <br/>
could sing and shout for joy to think I had been delivered <br/>
from the power of the evil one.</p>

<p>Filled with the power of God, I stood up in the midst of the <br/>
congregation and preached the gospel of Jesus Christ unto <br/>
the people in great plainness.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting we assembled on the banks of <br/>
the [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]], ""because there was much water there,"" <br/>
and I led six of my friends into the river and baptized them <br/>
for the remission of their sins.</p>

<p>All of my father's household were included in this number, <br/>
according to the promise of the [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Patriarch]]. They were all <br/>
relatives except [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]], who was a [[Methodist|Methodist]] class-<br/>
leader and was boarding with my father's family.</p>

<p>I organized the small number of nine persons, eight of <br/>
whom were my relatives, into a branch of the Church, and <br/>
ordained Dwight Webster to the office of a [[Priest|Priest]] and <br/>
administer the [[sacrament|sacrament]] unto them.</p>

<p>It was truly a day of joy to my soul. My father, [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-<br/>
mother]] and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] were among the number baptized. I <br/>
afterwards added a number of relatives. I felt that this<br/>
day's work alone amply repaid me for all my labor in the <br/>
ministry.</p>

<p>Who can comprehend the joy, the glory, the happiness and <br/>
consolation that an Elder of Israel feels in being an instrument <br/>
in the hands of God of bringing his father, mother, sister, <br/>
brother, or any of the posterity of Adam through the door <br/>
that enters into life and salvation? No man can, unless he has <br/>
experienced these things, and possesses the testimony of <br/>
Jesus Christ and the inspiration of Almighty God.</p>

OF MY FIRST [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|CHILD]]—APPOINTMENT TO THE APOSTLE-<br/>
SHIP AND TO A FOREIGN MISSION—PREPARATION FOR <br/>
THE JOURNEY TO ZION.</p>

<p>NOW, as my mission to my native land was accomplished, <br/>
which I felt impressed to take while upon the [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|islands]], I <br/>
felt it my duty to return here.</p>

at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] home while upon this mission. At the setting <br/>
of the sun I took the last walk with my [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] I ever had with <br/>
her while in my native [[Connecticut|State]]. We walked by the canal and <br/>
viewed the river and fields, and conversed upon our future <br/>
destiny.</p>

<p>After evening prayer with the family, my father retired to <br/>
rest, and I spent a season with my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-mother]] who had <br/>
reared me from my infancy. In conversation we felt sensibly <br/>
the weight of the power of temptation, out of which the Lord <br/>
had delivered us.</p>

<p>I also spent a short time with my sister Eunice, the only <br/>
sister I was ever blessed with in my father's family. I had <br/>
baptized her into the Church and Kingdom of God, and we <br/>
mingled our sympathies, prayers and tears together before the <br/>
throne of grace.</p>

<p>How truly are the bonds of consanguinity and of the blood <br/>
of Christ united in binding the hearts of the Saints of God <br/>
together, and ""how blessings brighten as they take their <br/>
flight!""</p>

<p>This being the last night I was to spend beneath my father's <br/>
roof while upon this mission, I felt the weight of it, and my <br/>
prayer was, ""O, Lord, protect my father's house, and bring <br/>
him to Zion!"" (which prayer was granted.)</p>

work of God I had labored to establish. They threatened my <br/>
life, but the Saints were willing to stand by me.</p>

attempted during my experience as a minister of the gospel. <br/>

at them and at me, and upon her babe, and, while gazing upon <br/>

<p>JOSEPH SMITH, the Prophet, asked the Lord what His <br/>

places of those who have fallen, and be officially notified <br/>
of their appointment.""</p>",
671.0,69,,"<p>DETERMINED TO FULFILL THE LORD'S COMMAND.</p>

<p>It will be observed that this differs from nearly all other <br/>
revelations in this respect: a fixed day and a stated place were <br/>
given for the commencement of the mission. When the reve-<br/>
lation was given, all was peace and quietude in [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]],<br/>
Missouri, the city where most of the Latter-day Saints dwelt; <br/>
but before the time came for its fulfillment, the Saints of God <br/>
had been driven out of the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]] into the State <br/>
of [[Illinois|Illinois]], under the edict of Governor [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]; and the Mis-<br/>
sourians had sworn that if all the other revelations of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph <br/>
Smith]] were fulfilled, that should not be. It stated the day <br/>
and the place where the [[Twelve Apostles|Twelve Apostles]] should take leave <br/>
of the Saints, to go on their missions across the great waters, <br/>
and the mobocrats of Missouri had declared that they would <br/>
see that it should not be fulfilled.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the Lord, having a foreknowledge of <br/>
what would take place, had given the revelation in this man-<br/>
ner to see whether the Apostles would obey it at the risk of <br/>
their lives.</p>

<p>When the time drew near for the fulfillment of this com-<br/>
mandment of the Lord, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] was the President of <br/>
the Twelve Apostles; [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thos. B. Marsh]], who was the senior Apostle, had fallen. Brother Brigham called together those <br/>
of the Twelve who were then at [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], Illinois, to see what <br/>
their minds would be about going to Far West, to fulfill the <br/>
revelation. The Prophet Joseph and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], <br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] were in <br/>
prison in Missouri, at the time; but Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]], <br/>
the Patriarch, was at Quincy, Illinois. He and others who <br/>
were present did not think it wisdom for us to attempt the <br/>
journey, as our lives would be in great jeopardy. They <br/>
thought the Lord would take the will for the deed. But when <br/>
President Young asked the Twelve what our feelings were <br/>
upon the subject, we all of us, as the voice of one man, said <br/>
the Lord God had spoken, and it was for us to obey. It was <br/>
the Lord's business to take care of His servants, and we <br/>
would fulfill the commandment, or die trying</p>

<p>To fully understand the risk the Twelve Apostles ran in <br/>
making this journey, my readers should remember that <br/>
Lilburn W. Boggs, governor of the State of Missouri, had</p>",

had been captured by the militia, who were really only an <br/>
organized mob; the citizens had been compelled to give up <br/>
their arms; all the leading men who could be got hold of had <br/>
been taken prisoners; the rest of the Saints—men women and <br/>
children—had to flee as best they could out of the State to <br/>
save their lives, leaving all their houses, lands and other prop-<br/>
erty which they could not carry with them to be taken by the <br/>
mob. In fact they shot down the cattle and hogs of the <br/>
Saints wherever they could find them, and robbed them of <br/>
nearly everything they could lay their hands upon. Latter-<br/>
day Saints were treated with merciless cruelty and had to <br/>
endure the most outrageous abuses. It was with the greatest <br/>
difficulty that many of them got out of the State, especially <br/>
the prominent men; for there were many men of that State at <br/>
that time, who acted as though they thought it no more harm <br/>
to shoot a ""Mormon"" than a mad dog. From this brief ex-<br/>
planation you will be able to understand why some of the <br/>
brethren thought we were not required to go back to Far West <br/>
to start from there upon our mission across the ocean to <br/>
[[Europe|Europe]].</p>

<p>Having determined to carry out the requirement of the <br/>
revelation, on the <time datetime=""",04/18/1839

[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]; and Father [[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]] took <br/>
into his wagon [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]], and we <br/>
started for Far West.</p>

<p>On the way we met [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]], who was going <br/>
with his family, to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], Illinois. His wagon had turned <br/>
over, and when we met him he was trying to gather up a <br/>
barrel of soft soap with his hands. We helped him get up <br/>
his wagon. He drove down into the valley below, left his <br/>
wagon, and accompanied us on our way.</p>

thousand of the Saints had been driven out of the [[Missouri|State]] by <br/>
the edict of the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|governor]], and though the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
and his brother, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], with other leading men were <br/>
in the hands of our enemies, in chains and in prison, we <br/>
moved on to the temple grounds in the city of [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and <br/>
held a council, and fulfilled the revelation and commandments <br/>
given unto us, and we performed many other things at this <br/>
council.</p>

<p>We excommunicated from the Church thirty-one persons, <br/>
who had apostatized and become its enemies.</p>

<p>The ""Mission of the Twelve"" was sung, and we then <br/>
repaired to the south-east corner of the temple ground, and, <br/>
with the assistance of Elder [[Alpheus Cutler|Alpheus Cutler]], the master work-<br/>
man of the building committee, laid the south-east chief <br/>
[[cornerstone|corner stone]] of the temple, according to revelation.</p>

<p>There were present of the Twelve Apostles: [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and <br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], who proceeded to ordain Wilford Woodruff and <br/>
[[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]], to the apostleship, and as members of the <br/>
quorum of the Twelve, in the places of those who had fallen, <br/>

<p>[[Darwin Chase|Darwin Chase]] and [[Norman Shearer|Norman Shearer]], who had just been <br/>
liberated from [[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]] prison, were also ordained to the <br/>

in the following order: Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, <br/>
Orson Pratt, John E. Page, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff <br/>
and George A. Smith, after which we sang ""Adam-ondi-<br/>

<p>The Twelve then took their leave of, and gave the parting <br/>
hand to, the following Saints, agreeable to revelation: [[A. Butler|A.<br/>

<p>There was an incident connected with our journey that is <br/>
worthy of record. While we were on our way to fulfill the <br/>
revelation, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], the Prophet, and his companions in chains <br/>
had been liberated, through the blessings of God, from their <br/>
enemies and prison, and they passed us. We were not far <br/>
distant from each other, but neither party knew it. They were <br/>
making their way to their families in Illinois, while we were <br/>
traveling to the [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] into the midst of our enemies. So they <br/>
came home to their families and friends before our return.</p>

Twelve, I rode four miles out of town to Mr. [[John Cleveland|Cleveland's]], to <br/>
visit Brother Joseph Smith and his family.</p>

<p>Once more I had the happy privilege of taking Brother <br/>
Joseph by the hand. Two years had rolled away since I had <br/>
seen his face. He greeted us with great joy, as did [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum <br/>

imprisonment together. They had been confined in prison six <br/>
months, and had been under sentence of death three times; <br/>
yet their lives were in the hands of God, and He had delivered <br/>
them, and they were now mingling with their wives, children <br/>
and friends, and out of the reach of the mob. Joseph was <br/>
frank, open and familiar as usual, and our rejoicing was great.</p>

<p>No man can understand the joyful sensations created by <br/>
such a meeting, except those who have been in tribulation for <br/>
the gospel's sake.</p>

wounded at Haun's Mill. Among them was [[Isaac Laney|Isaac Laney]], <br/>
who had been, in company with about twenty others, at the <br/>
mill, when a large armed mob fired among them with rifles <br/>
and other weapons, and shot down seventeen of the brethren, <br/>
and wounded more. Brother Laney fled from the scene, but <br/>
they poured a shower of lead after him, which pierced his <br/>
body through and through. He showed me eleven bullet <br/>
holes in his body. There were twenty-seven in his shirt, seven <br/>
in his pantaloons, and his coat was literally cut to pieces. <br/>
One ball entered one arm-pit and came out at the other.</p>

<p>Another entered his back and came out at the breast. A <br/>
ball passed through each hip, each leg and each arm. All <br/>
these shots were received while he was running for life, and, <br/>
strange as it may appear, though he had also one of his ribs <br/>
broken, he was able to outrun his enemies, and his life was <br/>
saved. We can only acknowledge this deliverance to be by <br/>
the power and mercy of God.</p>

also fled, and although the balls flew around him like hail, he <br/>
was not wounded. How mysterious are the ways of the Lord!</p>

<p>A DAY OF GOD'S POWER WITH THE PROPHET [[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH SMITH]]<br/>
—A GREAT NUMBER OF SICK PERSONS HEALED—THE MOB<br/>
BECOMES ALARMED—THEY TRY TO INTERFERE WITH <br/>
THE HEALING OF THE SICK—THE MOB SENT OUT OF <br/>
THE HOUSE—TWIN CHILDREN HEALED.</p>

<p>WHILE I was living in this cabin in the old barracks, we <br/>
experienced a day of God's power with the Prophet <br/>
Joseph. It was a very sickly time and Joseph had given up <br/>
his home in [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] to the sick, and had a tent pitched in <br/>
his door-yard and was living in that himself. The large num-<br/>
ber of Saints who had been driven out of [[Missouri|Missouri]], were <br/>
walking into Commerce; but had no homes to go into, and were <br/>
living in wagons, in tents, and on the ground. Many, there-<br/>
fore, were sick through the exposure they were subjected to. <br/>
Brother Joseph had waited on the sick, until he was worn <br/>
out and nearly sick himself.</p>

<p>On the morning of the <time datetime=""",07/22/1839
671.0,74,,""">22nd of July, 1839</time>, he arose reflect-<br/>
ing upon the situation of the Saints of God in their persecu-<br/>
tions and afflictions, and he called upon the Lord in prayer, <br/>
and the [[power of God|power of God]] rested upon him mightily, and as Jesus <br/>
healed all the sick around Him in His day, so Joseph, the <br/>
Prophet of God, healed all around on this occasion. He <br/>
healed all in his house and door-yard, then, in company with <br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] and several of the Twelve, he went through <br/>
among the sick lying on the bank of the river, and he <br/>
commanded them in a loud voice, in the name of Jesus Christ <br/>
to come up and be made whole, and they were all healed. <br/>
When he healed all that were sick on the east side of the <br/>
river, they crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] in a ferry-boat to the <br/>
west side, to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]], where we were. The first house they <br/>
went into was President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]]. He was sick on <br/>
his bed at the time. The Prophet went into his house and <br/>
healed him, and they all came out together. As they were</p>",
671.0,75,,"<p>HEALING THE SICK.</p>

<p>passing by my door, Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said: ""Brother Wood-<br/>
ruff, follow me.” These were the only words spoken by any of <br/>
the company from the time they left Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham's]] house <br/>
till we crossed the public square, and entered [[Elijah Fordham|Brother Ford-<br/>
ham's]] house. Brother Fordham had been dying for an hour, <br/>
and we expected each minute would be his last.</p>

<p>I felt the power of God that was overwhelming His Prophet.</p>

<p>When we entered the house, Brother Joseph walked up to <br/>
Brother Fordham, and took him by the right hand; in his <br/>
left hand he held his hat.</p>

<p>He saw that Brother Fordham’s eyes were glazed, and that <br/>
he was speechless and unconscious.</p>

<p>After taking hold of his hand, he looked down into the <br/>
dying man's face and said: ""Brother Fordham, do you not <br/>
know me?"" At first he made no reply; but we could all see <br/>
the effect of the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] resting upon him.</p>

<p>He again said: ""Elijah, do you not know me?""</p>

<p>With a low whisper, Brother Fordham answered, ""Yes!""</p>

<p>The Prophet then said, ""Have you not faith to be healed?""</p>

<p>The answer, which was a little plainer than before, was: ""I <br/>
am afraid it is too late. If you had come sooner, I think it <br/>
might have been.”</p>

<p>He had the appearance of a man waking from sleep. It <br/>
was the sleep of death.</p>

<p>Joseph then said: ""Do you believe that Jesus is the Christ?""</p>

<p>""I do, Brother Joseph,"" was the response.</p>

<p>Then the Prophet of God spoke with a loud voice, as in <br/>
the majesty of the Godhead: ""Elijah, I command you, in the <br/>
name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise and be made whole!""</p>

<p>The words of the Prophet were not like the words of a man, <br/>
but like the [[voice of God|voice of God]]. It seemed to me that the house <br/>
shook from its foundation.</p>

<p>Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed like a man raised from <br/>
the dead. A healthy color came to his face, and life was mani-<br/>
fested in every act.</p>

<p>His feet were done up in Indian meal [[poultices|poultices]]. He kicked <br/>
them off his feet, scattered the contents, and then called <br/>
for his clothes and put them on. He asked for a bowl of bread</p>",
671.0,76,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>and milk, and ate it; then put on his hat and followed us <br/>
into the street, to visit others who were sick.</p>

<p>The unbeliever may ask: “Was there not deception in this?”</p>

<p>If there is any deception in the mind of the unbeliever, <br/>
there was certainly none with [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]], the dying man, <br/>
nor with those who were present with him, for in a few min-<br/>
utes more he would have been in the [[spirit world|spirit world]], had he not <br/>
been rescued. Through the blessing of God, he lived up till <br/>
1880, in which year he died in [[Utah Territory|Utah]], while all who were with <br/>
him on that occasion, with the exception of one, are in the <br/>
spirit world.</p>

<p>Among the number were [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney <br/>
Rigdon]], [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[George Albert Smith|George A. <br/>
Smith]], [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]. Wilford Woodruff <br/>
is the only one living who was present at the time, and he <br/>
will soon mingle with those who have gone.</p>

<p>As soon as we left Brother Fordham's house, we went into <br/>
the house of [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Noble]], who was very low and <br/>
dangerously sick.</p>

<p>When we entered the house, Brother Joseph took him by <br/>
the hand, and commanded him, in the name of Jesus Christ, <br/>
to arise and be made whole. He did arise and was immedi-<br/>
ately healed.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the wicked mob in the place, led <br/>
by one [[David Wells Kilbourne|Kilburn]], had become alarmed, and followed us into <br/>
Brother Noble's house.</p>

<p>Before they arrived there, Brother Joseph had called upon <br/>
Brother Fordham to offer prayer.</p>

<p>While he was praying, the mob entered, with all the evil <br/>
spirits accompanying them.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered, Brother Fordham, who was pray-<br/>
ing, fainted and sank to the floor.</p>

<p>When Joseph saw the mob in the house, he arose and had <br/>
the room cleared of both that class of men and their attend-<br/>
ant devils. Then Brother Fordham immediately revived and <br/>
finished his prayer.</p>

<p>This shows what power [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] have upon the taberna-<br/>
cles of men. The Saints are only saved from the power of <br/>
the devil by the power of God.</p>",
671.0,77,,"<p>SENT TO HEAL TWIN CHILDREN.</p>

<p>This case of Brother [[Joseph Bates Noble|Noble's]] was the last one of healing <br/>
upon that day. It was the greatest day for the manifestation <br/>
of the [[power of God|power of God]] through the [[gift of healing|gift of healing]] since the <br/>
organization of the Church.</p>

<p>When we left Brother Noble, the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] went, <br/>
with those who accompanied him from the other side, to the <br/>
banks of the river, to return home.</p>

<p>While waiting for the ferry-boat, a man of the world, <br/>
knowing of the miracles which had been performed, came to <br/>
him and asked him if he would not go and heal two twin <br/>
children of his, about five months old, who were both lying <br/>
sick nigh unto death.</p>

<p>They were some two miles from [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]].</p>

<p>The Prophet said he could not go; but, after pausing some<br/>
time, he said he would send someone to heal them; and he <br/>
turned to me and said: ""You go with the man and heal his <br/>
children.”</p>

<p>He took a red silk handkerchief out of his pocket and gave <br/>
it to me, and told me to wipe their faces with the handker-<br/>
chief when I administered to them, and they should be <br/>
healed. He also said unto me: ""As long as you will keep <br/>
that handkerchief, it shall remain a league between you and <br/>
me.""</p>

<p>I went with the man, and did as the Prophet commanded <br/>
me, and the children were healed.</p>

<p>I have possession of the handkerchief unto this day.</p>",

ors, [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] <br/>
to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa|Montrose]], to spend the day with the Twelve, and set them <br/>
apart and bless them, before they started upon their missions. <br/>
There were twelve of us who met there, and we all dined in <br/>
my house.</p>

<p>After dinner, we assembled at Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]] <br/>
house for our meeting.</p>

<p>Brother Hyrum Smith opened by prayer; after which the <br/>
Presidency laid their hands upon our heads and gave each of <br/>
us a blessing.</p>

<p>President Rigdon was mouth in blessing me, and also <br/>
blessed Sisters [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]], [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]].</p>

<p>The Prophet Joseph promised us if we would be faithful, <br/>
we should be blessed upon our mission, have many souls as <br/>
seals of our ministry, and return again in peace and safety to <br/>
our families and friends; all of which was fulfilled.</p>

<p>Brother Hyrum advised me to preach the first principles of <br/>
the gospel; he thought that was about as much as this gener-<br/>
ation could endure.</p>

<p>Then Joseph arose and preached some precious things of <br/>
the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] unto us, in the power of the Holy <br/>
Ghost; some of which I here copy from my journal:</p>

<p>""Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy, and be ready <br/>

ance and desire for forgiveness; for our [[Heavenly Father|Heavenly Father]] will <br/>

671.0,79,,"<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO THE TWELVE.</p>

<p>the Twelve be humble and not be exalted, and beware of pride <br/>
and not seek to excel one another, but act for each other's <br/>
good, and honorably make mention of each other's names in <br/>
prayer before the Lord and before your fellow-men. Do not <br/>
backbite or devour a brother. The Elders of Israel should <br/>
seek to learn by precept and example in this late age of the <br/>
world and not be obliged to learn everything we know by sad <br/>
experience. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] trust the remainder of the Twelve will learn <br/>
wisdom and not follow the example of those who have fallen. <br/>
When [[the Twelve|the Twelve]], or any other witnesses of Jesus Christ, stand <br/>
before the congregations of the earth, and they preach in the <br/>
power and demonstration of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]], and the people <br/>
are astonished and confounded at the doctrine, and say 'That <br/>
man has preached a powerful sermon, then let that man or <br/>
those men take care that they do not ascribe the glory unto <br/>
themselves, but be careful that they are humble, and ascribe <br/>
the glory to God and the Lamb; for it is by the power of <br/>
the [[Holy Priesthood|Holy Priesthood]] and the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] that they have <br/>
power thus to speak.</p>

<p>""Who art thou, O man, but dust! and from whom dost <br/>
thou receive thy power and blessings, but from God?</p>

<p>""Then let the Twelve Apostles and Elders of Israel observe <br/>
this key, and be wise: <i>Ye are not sent out to be taught, but to <br/>
teach</i>.</p>

<p>""Let every man be sober, be vigilant, and let all his words <br/>
be seasoned with grace, and keep in mind it is a day of warn-<br/>
ing, and not of many words.</p>

<p>""Act honestly before God and man; beware of sophistry, <br/>
such as bowing and scraping unto men in whom you have no <br/>
confidence. Be honest, open, and frank in all your intercourse <br/>
with mankind.</p>

<p>""I wish to say to the Twelve and all the Saints, to profit by <br/>
this important key, that in all your trials, troubles, tempta-<br/>
tions, afflictions, bonds, imprisonments and deaths, see to it <br/>
that you do not betray Jesus Christ, that you do not betray <br/>
the revelations of God, whether in the [[Bible|Bible]], [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mor-<br/>
mon]], or [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and Covenants]], or any of the words of God.</p>

<p>The foregoing are some of the instructions given to the <br/>
Twelve by the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], before they started upon their <br/>
missions.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the devil had been in a measure thwarted by <br/>
the Twelve going to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and returning without harm, <br/>
it seemed as though the destroyer was determined to make <br/>
some other attempt upon us to hinder us from performing <br/>
our missions; for it seemed that as soon as any one of the <br/>
Apostles began to prepare for starting, he was smitten with <br/>
chills and fever or sickness of some kind.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the quorum of the Twelve or their families <br/>
began to be sick, so it still required the exercise of a good deal <br/>
of faith and perseverance to start off on a mission.</p>

and fever, as were quite a number of the Twelve.</p>

<p>EARLY upon the morning of the <time datetime=""",08/08/1839

from my bed of sickness, [[laying on of hands|laid my hands]] upon the head <br/>
of my sick wife, [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phoebe]], and blessed her. I then departed <br/>
from the embrace of my companion, and left her almost with-<br/>
out food or the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>She parted from me with the fortitude that becomes a <br/>
Saint, realizing the responsibilities of her companion. I <br/>
quote from my journal:</p>

<p>""Phoebe, farewell! Be of good cheer; remember me in <br/>
your prayers. I leave these pages for your perusal when I <br/>
am gone. I shall see thy face again in the flesh. I go to <br/>
obey the commands of Jesus Christ.""</p>

<p>Although feeble, I walked to the banks of the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi <br/>
river]]. There President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] took me in a canoe <br/>
(having no other conveyance) and paddled me across the river.</p>

<p>When we landed, I lay down on a side of sole leather, by <br/>
the post office, to rest.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph, the Prophet of God, came along and looked <br/>
at me.</p>

<p>""Well, Brother Woodruff,"" said he, ""you have started <br/>
upon your mission.""</p>

<p>""Yes,"" said I, ""but I feel and look more like a subject for <br/>
the dissecting room than a missionary.”</p>

<p>Joseph replied: ""What did you say that for? Get up, and <br/>
go along; all will be right with you!""</p>

<p>I name these incidents that the reader may know how the <br/>
brethren of the [[Twelve Apostles|Twelve Apostles]] started upon their missions <br/>
to [[England|England]], in 1839.</p>

two of the quorum of the Twelve who started on their mission.</p>",

<p>Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] was about the only man in the quorum that <br/>
was not sick.</p>

<p>Soon a brother came along with a wagon, and took us in. <br/>
As we were driving through the place, we came to [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. <br/>
Pratt]], who was stripped to the shirt and pants with his head <br/>
and feet bare. He was hewing a log, preparing to build a <br/>
cabin.</p>

<p>""He said: ""Brother Woodruff, I have no money, but I <br/>
have an empty purse, which I will give you."" He brought <br/>
it to me, and I thanked him for it.</p>

<p>We went a few rods further, and met Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. <br/>
Kimball]], in the same condition, also hewing a log, towards <br/>
building a cabin.</p>

<p>He said: ""As Parley has given you a purse, I have got a <br/>
dollar I will give you to put in it.”</p>

<p>He gave me both a dollar and a blessing.</p>

<p>We drove sixteen miles across a prairie, and spent the night <br/>
with a Brother [[Brother Merrill|Merrill]]. The day following we rode ten miles, <br/>
to a Brother [[Ute Perkins|Perkins']], and he took us in his wagon to <br/>
[[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]], and from thence to Brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith's]].</p>

<p>I rode four hours during the day over a very rough road of <br/>
stones and stumps, lying on my back in the bottom of the <br/>
wagon, shaking with the ague, and I suffered much.</p>

<p>We held a meeting in a grove near Don Carlos Smith's, and <br/>
here Elder Taylor baptized [[George Miller|George Miller]], who afterwards <br/>
was ordained a Bishop.</p>

<p>At the meeting the Saints gave us nine dollars, and George <br/>
Miller gave us a horse to help us on our journey.</p>

interview with several families of the Fox Island Saints, <br/>
whom I had brought up with me from [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]], in 1838.<br/>

Elder Taylor published fifteen hundred copies, in pamphlet <br/>
form, of a brief sketch of the persecutions and sufferings of <br/>
the Latter-day Saints, inflicted by the inhabitants of [[Missouri|Mis-<br/>

excellent health, but the [[Destroyer|destroyer]] did not intend to make him <br/>

he would die. We stopped several hours with him at a house <br/>
by the wayside. We then took him into the wagon and drove <br/>
to [[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|Horace S. Eldredge's]], and spent the remainder of the day <br/>

Brother Townsend was away from home, but we were kindly <br/>
entertained by Sister [[Susan Davis Townsend|Townsend]].</p>

in that place was possessed of the [[Devil|devil]], and he asked me to <br/>
go and cast it out of her, thinking that one of the Twelve <br/>
Apostles could do anything in this line he might wish to.</p>

<p>However, I went with him to the house where the woman <br/>
lay, in the hands of three men, in a terrible rage, and trying <br/>
to tear her clothing from her.</p>

<p>I also found quite a number of Saints present, and some <br/>
unbelievers, who had come to see the devil cast out and a <br/>
miracle wrought.</p>

<p>If I had acted upon my own judgment I should not have <br/>
attempted to administer to her with the company present, but <br/>
as I was a stranger there, and Brother Clayton presided over <br/>
the branch, I joined him in administering to the woman. But <br/>
the unbelief of the wicked present was so great, we could not <br/>
cast the devil out of her, and she raged worse than ever.</p>

<p>I then ordered the room to be cleared, and when the com-<br/>
pany left the house, except the few attending to her, we [[laying on of hands|laid <br/>
hands]] upon her, and I commanded the devil to come out of <br/>
her, in the name of Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and she <br/>
was entirely cured and fell asleep.</p>

congregation of people, and bore testimony to what the Lord <br/>
has done for her. We had a large assemblage through the <br/>
day and evening, to whom I preached the gospel.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the devil, not being satisfied with <br/>
being cast out of the woman, entered into her little child, <br/>

671.0,90,1840-03-04,""">3rd of March, 1840</time>, in fulfillment of the word of <br/>
the Lord to me, I took coach and rode to [[Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England|Wolverhamp-<br/>
ton]], twenty-six miles, and spent the night there.</p>

<p>On the morning of the <time datetime=""",03/04/1840
671.0,90,,""">4th</time> I again took coach, and rode <br/>
through [[Dudley, Staffordshire, England|Dudley]], [[Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England|Stourbridge]], [[Stourport, Worcestershire, England|Stourport]] and [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]], and <br/>
then walked a number of miles to Mr. John Benbow's, [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill <br/>
Farm]], [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castle Frome]], [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]], Herefordshire. This was a <br/>
farming country in the south of [[England|England]], a region where no <br/>
Elder of the Latter-day Saints had visited.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthy farmer, cultivating <br/>
three hundred acres of land, occupying a good mansion, and <br/>
having plenty of means. His wife, [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Jane]], had no children.</p>

<p>I presented myself to him as a missionary from America, <br/>
an Elder of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], <br/>
who had been sent to him by the commandment of God as a <br/>
messenger of salvation, to preach the gospel of life unto him <br/>
and his household, and the inhabitants of the land.</p>

<p>Mr. Benbow and his wife received me with glad hearts and <br/>
thanksgiving. It was in the evening when I arrived, having</p>",
671.0,91,1840-03-05,"<p>THE WORD OF THE LORD FULFILLED.</p>

<p>traveled forty-eight miles by coach and on foot during the <br/>
day, but after receiving refreshments we sat down together, <br/>
and conversed until two o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. [[John Benbow|Benbow]] and his [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]] rejoiced greatly at the glad tidings <br/>
which I brought unto them of the fullness of the everlasting <br/>
gospel, which God had revealed through the mouth of His Prophet, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], in these last days.</p>

<p>1 rejoiced greatly at the news that Mr. Benbow gave me, <br/>
that there was a company of men and women over six hun-<br/>
dred in number who had broken off from the Wesleyan <br/>
[[Methodist|Methodists]], and taken the name of [[United Brethren|United Brethren]]. They <br/>
had forty-five preachers among them, and had chapels and many <br/>
houses that were licensed according to the law of the land for <br/>
preaching in.</p>

<p>This body of United Brethren were searching for light and <br/>
truth, but had gone as far as they could, and were continually <br/>
calling upon the Lord to open the way before them, and send <br/>
them light and knowledge that they might know the true way <br/>
to be saved.</p>

<p>When I heard these things I could clearly see why the Lord <br/>
had commanded me, while in the town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], to leave <br/>
that place of labor and go to the south, for in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] <br/>
there was a great harvest-field for gathering many Saints into <br/>
the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>I retired to my bed with joy after offering my prayers and <br/>
thanksgiving to God, and slept sweetly until the rising of the <br/>
sun.</p>

<p>I arose on the morning of the <time datetime=""",03/05/1840
671.0,91,,""">5th</time>, took breakfast, and told <br/>
Mr. Benbow I would like to commence my Master's business, <br/>
by preaching the gospel to the people.</p>

<p>He had a large hall in his mansion which was licensed for <br/>
preaching, and he sent word through the neighborhood that <br/>
an American missionary would preach at his house that <br/>
evening.</p>

<p>As the time drew nigh many of the neighbors came in, and <br/>
I preached my first gospel sermon in the house. I also <br/>
preached on the following evening at the same place, and <br/>
baptized six persons, including Mr. John Benbow and his <br/>
wife, and four preachers of the United Brethren.</p>",
671.0,92,1840-03-08,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>I spent most of the following day in clearing out a pool of <br/>
water, and preparing it for baptizing in, as I saw many to be <br/>
baptized there. I afterwards baptized six hundred in that <br/>
pool of water.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the <time datetime=""",03/08/1840
671.0,92,,""">8th</time>, I preached at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]] in the <br/>
morning, a [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley Hill]] in the afternoon, and at [[John Benbow|John Ben-<br/>
bow's]], [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill Farm]], in the evening.</p>

<p>The [[St. Michael and All Angels Parish Church, Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|parish church]] that stood in the neighborhood of <br/>
Brother Benbow's, presided over by the [[Henry Fisher|rector]] of the <br/>
parish, was attended during the day by only fifteen persons, <br/>
while I had a large congregation, estimated to number a <br/>
thousand, attend my meeting through the day and even-<br/>
ing.</p>

<p>When I arose in the evening to speak at Brother Benbow's <br/>
house, a man entered the door and informed me that he was <br/>
a constable, and had been sent by the rector of the parish <br/>
with a warrant to arrest me.</p>

<p>I asked him ""For what crime?""</p>

<p>He said, ""For preaching to the people.""</p>

<p>I told him that I, as well as the rector, had a license for <br/>
preaching the gospel to the people, and that if he would take <br/>
a chair I would wait upon him after meeting.</p>

<p>He took my chair and sat beside me. I preached the first <br/>
principles of the everlasting gospel for an hour and a quarter. <br/>
The power of God rested upon me, the Spirit filled the house, <br/>
and the people were convinced.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting I opened a door for baptism, <br/>
and seven offered themselves. Among the number were four <br/>
preachers and the constable.</p>

<p>The latter arose and said, ""Mr. Woodruff, I would like to <br/>
be baptized.""</p>

<p>I told him I would like to baptize him. I went down to the <br/>
pool and baptized the seven. We then met together and I <br/>
confirmed thirteen, and [[sacrament|broke bread]] unto the Saints and we all <br/>
rejoiced together.</p>

<p>The constable went to the rector and told him if he wanted <br/>
Mr. Woodruff taken up for preaching the gospel, he must go <br/>
himself and serve the writ, for he had heard him preach the <br/>
only true gospel sermon he had ever listened to in his life.</p>",

<p>The [[Henry Fisher|rector]] did not know what to make of it, so he sent two <br/>
clerks of the Church of England as spies, to attend our meet-<br/>
ing, and find out what we did preach.</p>

<p>But they were both pricked in their hearts and received the <br/>
word of the Lord gladly, and were baptized and confirmed <br/>
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

<p>The rector became alarmed and did not dare to send any-<br/>
body else.</p>

<p>The ministers and rectors of the South of [[England|England]] called a <br/>
convention and sent a petition to the [[William Howley|Archbishop]] of [[Canterbury, Kent, England|Canter-<br/>
bury]], to request parliament to pass a law prohibiting <br/>
the “Mormons” from preaching in the British dominion.</p>

<p>In this petition the rector stated that one “Mormon” mis-<br/>
sionary had baptized fifteen hundred persons, mostly members <br/>
of the English church, during the last seven months.</p>

<p>But the archbishop and council, knowing well that the laws <br/>
of England gave free toleration to all religions under the <br/>
British flag, sent word to the petitioners that if they had the <br/>
worth of souls at heart as much as they had the ground where <br/>
hares, foxes and hounds ran, they would not lose so many of <br/>
their flock.</p>

<p>I continued to preach and baptize daily.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",03/21/1840

<p>The first thirty days after my arrival in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], I had <br/>
baptized forty-five preachers and one hundred-sixty-mem-<br/>
bers of the United Brethren, who put into my hands one <br/>
chapel and forty-five houses, which were licensed according to <br/>
law to preach in.</p>

<p>This opened a wide field for labor, and enabled me to bring <br/>
into the Church, through the blessing of God, over eighteen <br/>
hundred souls during eight months, including all of the six-<br/>
hundred United Brethren except one person; also including <br/>
some two hundred preachers of various denominations.</p>

<p>This field of labor embraced Herefordshire, [[Gloucestershire, England|Gloucestershire]] <br/>

them, and some eighteen hundred souls received it, and many <br/>
of them have been gathered to Zion in these mountains. Many <br/>
of them have also been called to officiate in the bishopric, and <br/>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p>CLOSING TESTIMONY—GOOD AND EVIL SPIRITS.</p>

<p>BEFORE closing this little book, as a reader for our chil-<br/>
dren, I wish to bear my testimony upon several principles, <br/>
to the Latter-day Saints, especially to the [[rising generation|rising generation]], <br/>
the young men of Israel.</p>

<p>First, I wish to speak of the spirits of good and evil. The <br/>
Lord says, whatever leads to good is of God, and whatever <br/>
leads to do evil is of the [[Devil|devil]]. This is a very important sub-<br/>
ject for us to understand.</p>

<p>The scriptures again tell us that there are many spirits gone <br/>
out into the world; and that we should try the spirits, to prove <br/>
which are of God and which are of the evil one. The [[New Testament|New <br/>
Testament]] says that every spirit that confesses that Jesus is the <br/>
Christ, is born of God; and every spirit that denieth that <br/>
Jesus is the Christ is anti-Christ, and is not of God. I will <br/>
also add that every spirit that confesses that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] <br/>
was a Prophet of God, and that the <i>[[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]]</i>, <i>[[Bible|Bible]]</i> <br/>
and <i>[[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and Covenants]]</i> are true, is of God; and every <br/>
spirit that denieth this is not of God, but is of the evil one.</p>

<p>1 wish here to ask our young friends as well as the older <br/>
ones, the question: Do you ever consider or contemplate any-<br/>
thing about the number of [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] that occupy the earth, <br/>
who are at war against God and against all good, and who <br/>
seek to destroy all the children of men in every age of the<br/>
world?</p>

<p>Let us reason together a moment upon this subject. It may <br/>
be impossible for any man, without direct revelation from God, <br/>
to get to know the exact number, but we may approximate <br/>
towards it.</p>

<p>The Lord has said by revelation that [[Lucifer|Lucifer]], an angel in <br/>
authority, rebelled against God, and drew away one-third part <br/>
of the hosts of heaven; and he was cast down to the earth <br/>
and the heavens wept over him.</p>",
671.0,96,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>How many were cast out of heaven down to the earth? We <br/>
suppose that the inhabitants of heaven here referred to<br/>
were the spirits begotten of our Father in heaven who were to <br/>
come down to the earth and take tabernacles. How many <br/>
were there to come down and take tabernacles? This, again, <br/>
may be difficult to tell, yet perhaps we may come near enough <br/>
for the purpose. It has generally been conceded that there <br/>
are about 1,000,000,000 persons on the earth at a time, though <br/>
the late statistics make out 1,400,000,000 at the present time. <br/>
But we will say 1,000,000,000. It is also said that a genera-<br/>
tion passes off the earth every thirty-three and one-third <br/>
years, making three generations in a century, which would be <br/>
3,000,000,000 in one hundred years. Multiply this by ten <br/>
and it will make 30,000,000,000 in 1,000 years. Multiply <br/>
again by seven and it will make 210,000,000,000 in 7,000 <br/>
years.</p>

<p>The argument might be used that when our earth was first <br/>
peopled there were but two persons on the earth, and after the <br/>
flood but eight souls were left alive, but the probability is that <br/>
during the [[millennium|millennium]] the inhabitants will increase very fast <br/>
as the age of children will be as the age of a tree, and the <br/>
inhabitants of the earth will not die off as they do now.</p>

<p>But we will suppose that there were 100,000,000,000 of <br/>
fallen spirits sent down from heaven to earth, and that there <br/>
are, 1,000,000,000 of inhabitants upon the face of the earth <br/>
to-day, that would make one hundred evil spirits to every <br/>
man, woman and child living on the earth; and the whole <br/>
mission and labor of these spirits is to lead all the children of <br/>
men to do evil and to effect their destruction.</p>

<p>Now, I want all our boys and girls to reflect upon this, and <br/>
to see what danger they are in, and the warfare they have to <br/>
pass through.</p>

<p>These one hundred [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] to each one of the children <br/>
of men seek to lead them into every temptation possible, <br/>
to use tobacco, smoke, drink whisky, get drunk, curse, swear, <br/>
lie, steal, and commit adultery and murder, and do every evil <br/>
to cut them off from exaltation as far as possible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] labors and strives to <br/>
preserve all the children of men from these evils; and the</p>",
671.0,97,,"<p>ADVICE TO THE YOUNG.</p>

<p>Lord has given His angels charge concerning us, and they do <br/>
all they can for our salvation.</p>

<p>But yet we all have our agency, to choose the good and <br/>
refuse the evil, or choose the evil and refuse the good. The <br/>
Lord forces no man to heaven; neither does the Lord tempt <br/>
any man to do evil. When a man is tempted to do evil, it <br/>
is by the power of the [[devil|devil]], who is an enemy to all righteous-<br/>
ness.</p>

<p>I feel very anxious to have our boys and girls, our young <br/>
men and maidens, seek for that which is good.</p>

<p>Whenever you are tempted to do evil, turn from it. Never <br/>
make light of any of the commandments or ordinances of the <br/>
gospel of Christ, and when you meet with any persons who do <br/>
it, shun their society.</p>

<p>Avoid the use of tobacco and [[strong drink|strong drink]], for they lead to evil.</p>

<p>You are laying the foundation while in the days of your <br/>
youth, for character which will decide your destiny through <br/>
all time and throughout all eternity, either for good or evil.</p>

<p>The Lord has told us by revelation (See <i>[[Doctrine and Covenants|Doc. and Cov.]]</i> Sec.<br/>
130) that whatever knowledge or principle of intelligence we <br/>
attain to in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection, <br/>
and any person who gains more knowledge and intelligence in <br/>
this life through his diligence and obedience than another, <br/>
will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</p>

<p>Therefore, we should all strive to be diligent in obtaining <br/>
intelligence, and bringing to pass righteousness upon our <br/>
agency, and not wait to be commanded in all things, and great <br/>
will be our reward in so doing.</p>",

<p>HOW TO OBTAIN REVELATION FROM GOD—[[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH SMITH'S]] <br/>
COURSE—SAVED FROM DEATH BY A FALLING TREE, BY <br/>
OBEYING THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT—A COMPANY OF <br/>
SAINTS SAVED FROM A STEAMBOAT DISASTER BY THE <br/>
SPIRIT'S WARNING—PLOT TO WAYLAY ELDER [[Charles Coulson Rich|C. C. RICH]]<br/>
AND PARTY FOILED BY THE SAME POWER.</p>

<p>IN order to obtain revelation from God, and in order to know, <br/>
when we do obtain a revelation, whether it is from God or <br/>
not, we must follow the teachings of the revelations of God <br/>
unto us St. [[Epistle of James|James]] says: ""If any man lack wisdom, let him <br/>
ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth <br/>
not; and it shall be given him."" [##James 1:5##] Again, it is said,  ""Ask, and <br/>
it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it <br/>
shall be opened unto you."" [##Matthew 7:7##]</p>

<p>It was upon this promise that Joseph Smith went before <br/>
the Lord and prayed in the name of Jesus Christ, and asked <br/>
for knowledge, wisdom and understanding, in order to know <br/>
what to do to be saved; and he proved the promise of St. <br/>
[[James (NT)|James]] before the Lord, and the heavens were opened to his <br/>
view, and the Father and Son were revealed unto him, and <br/>
the voice of the great [[Elohim|Eloheim]] unto him was: ”This is my <br/>
beloved Son, hear ye Him.""</p>

<p>This was the first revelation of God to him. He did <br/>
hearken to the voice of Jesus Christ all his life afterwards, <br/>
and received a code of revelations and the word of the Lord <br/>
unto him as long as he dwelt in the flesh.</p>

<p>Joseph Smith left as strong a testimony as was ever given <br/>
to the human family, and sealed that testament with his own <br/>
life and blood.</p>

<p>We all have to pursue the same course in order to obtain <br/>
revelations from God. But I wish to impress this truth upon <br/>
the [[rising generation|rising generation]] and all who read this testimony, that the <br/>
Lord does not give revelations or send angels to men or work</p>",
671.0,99,,"<p>INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PROPHET [[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH SMITH]].</p>

<p>miracles to accommodate the notions of any man who is seek-<br/>
ing for a sign.</p>

<p>When we have the principles of the gospel revealed to us <br/>
through the mouth of the Savior, or by inspired prophets or <br/>
apostles, we have no need to ask the Lord to reveal that unto <br/>
us again.</p>

<p>While the priesthood is restored to the earth, and <br/>
the revelations of God are revealed to us through the mouths <br/>
of prophets and apostles concerning the [[fulness of the gospel|fullness of the gospel]] <br/>
—doctrine, ordinances and principles, we should study them, <br/>
and treasure up knowledge by faith. We should study out of <br/>
the best books, and the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] will bring to our remem-<br/>
brance those things which we stand in need of, in the self-same <br/>
hour that we are called to teach the people.</p>

<p>But when any priest, elder, prophet, apostle, or messenger <br/>
is sent of God to preach the gospel, gather the Saints, work <br/>
in temples or perform any work for the Lord, and that man <br/>
is faithful and humble before the Lord, in his prayers and <br/>
duty, and there is any snare or evil in his path, or the <br/>
righteous to be sought out, or danger to the emigration of the <br/>
Saints either by sea or land, or knowledge needed in a temple, <br/>
then the Lord will reveal to him all that is necessary to meet <br/>
the emergency.</p>

<p>The teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith to President <br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and the rest of us was to obtain the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Spirit]], <br/>
get acquainted with it and its operations, and listen to the <br/>
whisperings of that Spirit and obey its voice, and it soon <br/>
will become a principle of revelation unto us.</p>

<p>We have found this true in our experience, and in order to <br/>
prove whether a revelation is from God or not we follow out <br/>
the principles revealed to us, and if we find that which was <br/>
manifested to us prove true, we know it is from God; for <br/>
truth is one of His attributes, and the Holy Ghost deceiveth <br/>
no man. When a man becomes acquainted with the whisper-<br/>
ings of the Holy Ghost, which is revelation, he should be <br/>
very careful to obey it, for his life may depend upon it.</p>

<p>Revelation is one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and for <br/>
the benefit of my young friends who may read this work, I <br/>
will give an account of a few instances from my own experience <br/>
of listening to the revelations of the Holy Ghost to me.</p>",

<p>In 1848, after my return to [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] from our <br/>

his wagon by the side of mine, and not more than two feet <br/>
from it.</p>

<p>[[Dominicus Carter|Dominicus Carter]], of [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]], and my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and four children <br/>
were with me. My wife, one child and I went to bed in the <br/>
carriage, the rest sleeping in the house.</p>

<p>I had been in bed but a short time when a voice said to me: <br/>
“Get up, and move your carriage.""</p>

<p>It was not thunder, lightning or an earthquake, but the <br/>
[[still small voice|still, small voice]] of the Spirit of God the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]].</p>

<p>I told my wife I must get up and move my carriage. She <br/>
asked: ""What for?""</p>

<p>I got up and moved my carriage several rods, and set it by <br/>
the side of the house.</p>

<p>As I was returning to bed the same Spirit said to me, ''Go <br/>
and move your mules away from that oak tree,” which was <br/>
about one hundred yards north of our carriage.</p>

<p>I moved them to a young hickory grove and tied them up. <br/>
I then went to bed.</p>

<p>In thirty minutes a whirlwind caught the tree to which my <br/>
mules had been fastened, broke it off near the ground, and <br/>
carried it one hundred yards, sweeping away two fences in its <br/>
course, and laid it prostrate through that yard where my <br/>
carriage stood, and the top limbs hit my carriage as it was.</p>

<p>In the morning I measured the trunk of the tree which fell <br/>
where my carriage had stood, and I found it to be five feet in <br/>
circumference. It came within a foot of Brother Hyde's <br/>
wagon, but did not touch it.</p>

I saved my life and the lives of my wife and child, as well as <br/>
my animals.</p>

Saints from [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] and the east, on my arrival at [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] I <br/>
engaged a passage for myself and company on a steamer to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St. <br/>
Louis]]. But no sooner had I engaged the passage than the <br/>
Spirit said to me, ""Go not on board of that steamer, neither <br/>
you nor your company.''</p>

<p>I obeyed the revelation to me, and I did not go on board, <br/>
but took another steamer.</p>

<p>The first steamer started at dark, with two hundred passen-<br/>
gers on board. When five miles down the [[Ohio River, United States|Ohio river]] it took <br/>
fire, burned the tiller ropes so that the vessel could not reach <br/>
shore, and the lives of nearly all on board were lost either by <br/>
fire or water. We arrived in safety at our destination, by <br/>
obeying the revelation of the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] to us.</p>

<p>In another instance, after attending a large annual conference <br/>
in [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]], and, having a good deal of business to <br/>
attend to, I was somewhat weary, and at the close of the con-<br/>
ference I thought I would repair to my home and have a rest.</p>

<p>As I went into the yard the Spirit said to me, ""Take your <br/>
team and go to the farm,"" which is some three miles south of <br/>
the [[Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|tabernacle]].</p>

<p>As I was hitching the horses to the wagon Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]]<br/>
asked where I was going.</p>

<p>I said, ""To the farm.""</p>

<p>""What for?"" she asked.</p>

<p>""I do not know,"" I replied; but when I arrived there I <br/>
found out.</p>

<p>The creek had overflowed, broken through my ditch, sur-<br/>
rounded my home and filled my barn-yard and pig pen. My <br/>
[[Emma Smith Woodruff|wife]] was wading in the water, trying to turn it from the lot to <br/>
save the home and family.</p>

<p>Through my own exertions I soon turned it, and prevented <br/>
much damage that might have occurred had I not obeyed the <br/>
voice of the Spirit.</p>

<p>This same Spirit of revelation has been manifested to many <br/>
of my brethren in their labors in the kingdom of God, one of <br/>
which I will here name.</p>

<p>Elder [[Charles Coulson Rich|Chas. C. Rich]] was going from [[Sacramento, Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]] to [[San Bernardino, San Bernardino County, California|San <br/>
Bernardino]] with a company of the brethren. He had in his</p>",
671.0,102,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>possession a large amount of money to make payment on their <br/>
land purchase. This was known to some road agents in the <br/>
vicinity, who gathered a company of robbers and went on <br/>
ahead of Brother [[Charles Coulson Rich|Rich]] and lay in ambush, intending to kill <br/>
the ""Mormons"" and rob them of their money.</p>

<p>Before reaching the company of robbers Brother Rich came <br/>
to a by-path or trail. The Spirit then told him to take that <br/>
path.</p>

<p>The brethren with him marveled at his course, not knowing <br/>
that enemies awaited them, but they arrived in safety at San <br/>
Bernardino with their lives and money, while the robbers <br/>
wondered why their prey did not come.</p>

<p>RESULT OF NOT OBEYING THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT—LOST <br/>
IN A SNOWSTORM—SAVED IN ANSWER TO PRAYER—<br/>
REVELATION TO MISSIONARIES NECESSARY—REVELA-<br/>
TIONS IN THE [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|ST. GEORGE TEMPLE]].</p>

<p>I WILL now give an example from my own experience of <br/>
the result of not obeying the voice of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Some years since I had a part of my family living in [[Randolph, Rich County, Utah Territory|Ran-<br/>
dolph]], Rich County. I was there on a visit, with my team, <br/>
in the month of December.</p>

<p>One Monday morning my monitor, the Spirit watching <br/>
over me, said, ""Take your team and go home to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake <br/>
City]].""</p>

<p>When I named it to my family who were at Randolph they <br/>
urged me strongly to stop longer.</p>

<p>Through their persuasion I stayed until Saturday morning, <br/>
with the Spirit continually prompting me to go home. I then <br/>
began to feel ashamed to think that I had not obeyed the <br/>
whisperings of the Spirit to me before.</p>",
671.0,103,,"<p>LOST IN A SNOW STORM.</p>

<p>I took my team and started early on Saturday morning. <br/>
When I arrived at [[Woodruff, Rich County, Utah Territory|Woodruff]], the Bishop urged me to stop <br/>
until Monday and he would go with me.</p>

<p>I told him, ""No, I had tarried too long already.""</p>

<p>I drove on sprightly, and when within fifteen miles of<br/>
[[Wasatch County, Utah Territory|Wasatch]], a furious snow storm overtook me, the wind blowing <br/>
heavily in my face.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes I could not see any road whatever, and <br/>
knew not how or where to guide my horses.</p>

<p>I left my lines loosely on my animals, went inside my wagon, <br/>
tied down the cover, and committed my life and guidance into <br/>
the hands of the Lord, trusting to my horses to find the way, <br/>
as they had twice before passed over that road.</p>

<p>I prayed to the Lord to forgive my sin in not obeying the <br/>
voice of the Spirit to me, and implored Him to preserve my <br/>
life.</p>

<p>My horses brought me into the Wasatch station at 9 o'clock <br/>
in the evening, with the hubs of my wagon dragging in the <br/>
snow.</p>

<p>I got my horses under cover, and had to remain there until <br/>
the next Monday night, with the snow six feet deep on the <br/>
level, and still snowing.</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty at last that I saved the lives of <br/>
my horses by getting them into a box car and taking them to <br/>
[[Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Ogden]]; while if I had obeyed the revelation of <br/>
the Spirit of God to me, I should have traveled to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] over a <br/>
good road without any storm.</p>

<p>As I have received the good and the evil, the fruits of <br/>
obedience and disobedience, I think I am justified in exhorting <br/>
all my young friends to always obey the whisperings of the <br/>
Spirit of God, and they will always be safe.</p>

<p>The [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] will rule over and guide all men who will <br/>
permit it and seek for it, and this is especially necessary for <br/>
young Elders who are laboring in the vineyard of the Lord. <br/>
For the Lord knows where the righteous, honest and meek of <br/>
the earth are, and will lead the Elders to them</p>

<p>I have already related a remarkable instance of this in my <br/>
own experience, when the voice of the Lord came to me in <br/>
the town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], England, in 1840.</p>",
671.0,104,1877-03-01,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>In that case it dictated me quite contrary to my expecta-<br/>
tions, for I had appointments out for a week ahead. But I <br/>
obeyed the voice of the Spirit, went south as I was directed <br/>
to, and my readers know the result.</p>

<p>I will refer to one more instance in my experience upon the <br/>
subject of revelation:</p>

<p>All the Latter-day Saints understand that we build temples <br/>
for the purpose of administering ordinances for the dead as <br/>
well as for the living.</p>

<p>The Lord has opened the way in a remarkable manner for <br/>
many of the members of the Church to obtain records of the <br/>
names of their dead for several generations.</p>

<p>I had also obtained a record of somewhat over three thous-<br/>
and of my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] and [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|mother's]] families.</p>

<p>After the dedication of the [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|temple]] at [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George]], President <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] appointed me to preside over it. When we com-<br/>
menced work in the temple I began to reflect: ""How can I <br/>
redeem my dead? I have some three thousand names of the <br/>
dead who have been baptized for, and how can I get endow-<br/>
ments for them?""</p>

<p>I had none of my family there, and if they had been there <br/>
they would not have been able to get [[endowments|endowments]] for so many.</p>

<p>While praying to the Lord to show me how to redeem my <br/>
dead, the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] rested upon me, and the voice of the <br/>
Spirit said to me, ""Go and call upon the sons and the daugh-<br/>
ters of Zion in St. George, to come into the temple of the <br/>
Lord and get their endowments for your dead; and it shall be <br/>
acceptable unto me, saith the Lord.”</p>

<p>This filled my soul with joy, and I saw that it opened a field <br/>
as wide as eternity for the salvation of our dead and the <br/>
redemption of man, that we might magnify our calling as <br/>
[[saviors on Mount Zion|saviors upon Mount Zion]].</p>

<p>On my [[birthday|birthday]], <time datetime=""",03/01/1877
671.0,104,,""">March 1, 1877</time>, the day that I was seventy <br/>
years old, one hundred and fifty-four sisters at St. George went <br/>
into the temple to get endowments for the same number of <br/>
the female portion of my dead.</p>

<p>This principle was received by President Young and adopted <br/>
from that hour, and through the kindness of friends I have had <br/>
nearly two thousand of my friends receive endowments in the</p>",
671.0,105,,"<p>PATRIARCHAL BLESSINGS.</p>

<p>temple of the Lord; and thousands of others have received <br/>
the same blessings in the same way.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] received revelations in that [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|temple]], and <br/>
there are yet many revelations to be received in the last days, <br/>
concerning the [[redemption of the dead|redemption of the dead]] and many other sub-<br/>
jects, but they will all be manifest in due time through the <br/>
proper authority unto the Church and Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>There are many other manifestations of the power of God <br/>
and the revelations of Jesus Christ to us in our lives. We <br/>
have been called by revelation to give [[endowments|endowments]] for many <br/>
persons now dead, who, when living, were honorable men of <br/>
the earth, and some who were prominent in our nation, but <br/>
who were not members of our family.</p>

<p>But I have said sufficient upon this branch of the sub-<br/>
ject.</p>

<p>PATRIARCHAL BLESSINGS AND THEIR FULFILLMENT—PRE-<br/>

[[California|CALIFORNIA]]—TAUGHT BY AN ANGEL—STRUGGLE WITH <br/>
EVIL SPIRITS—ADMINISTERED TO BY ANGELS—WHAT <br/>
ANGELS ARE SENT TO THE EARTH FOR.</p>

<p>THE duty of a Patriarch is to bestow blessings upon his <br/>
posterity and the children of men.</p>

<p>In a revelation (<i>[[Doctrine and Covenants|Doc, and Cov.]]</i>, Sec. 107), the Lord says that <br/>
""Three years previous to the death of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]], he called [[Seth (OT)|Seth]], <br/>
[[Enos (OT)|Enos]], [[Cainan (OT)|Cainan]], [[Mahalaleel (OT)|Mahalaleel]], [[Jared (OT)|Jared]], [[Enoch (OT)|Enoch]], and [[Methuselah (OT)|Methuselah]], who <br/>
were all High Priests, with the residue of his posterity who <br/>
were righteous, into the valley of [[Adam-ondi-Ahman, Daviess County, Missouri|Adam-ondi-Ahman]], and <br/>
there bestowed upon them his last blessings. * * And <br/>
Adam * * predicted whatsoever should befall his pos-<br/>
terity unto the last generation. These things are all written</p>",
671.0,106,1837-03-15,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>in the [[Book of Enoch|book of Enoch]], and are to be testified of in due <br/>
time.""</p>

<p>[[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]], [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] and [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]] were Patriarchs, and blessed <br/>
their posterity. All that Jacob said and scaled upon the <br/>
heads of his twelve sons has been fulfilled to the very letter, <br/>
as far as time has permitted.</p>

<p>We also have Patriarchs in our day. Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph <br/>
Smith]], the father of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], was the first <br/>
[[Patriarch|Patriarch]] of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. <br/>
He gave a great many blessings unto the Saints, which are <br/>
recorded, and many of them have seen their fulfillment.</p>

<p>When he put his hands on the head of a person to bless <br/>
him, it seemed as though the heavens were opened, and he <br/>
could reveal the whole life of that person.</p>

<p>He gave me my patriarchal blessing in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|temple]] of the <br/>
Lord at Kirtland, on the <time datetime=""",03/15/1837
671.0,106,,""">15th day of April, 1837</time>.</p>

<p>Many marvelous things which he sealed upon my head, for <br/>
which I could then see no earthly chance of fulfillment, have <br/>
already been fulfilled to the very letter.</p>

<p>One or two instances I will name. He said I should have <br/>
access to the treasures hid in the ground to assist me in get-<br/>
ting myself and others to Zion.</p>

<p>When in [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] gathering up the Saints, in 1850 <br/>
[[Alexander Badlam|Alexander Badlam]] went to [[California|California]] on business, and the <br/>
Saints who were digging gold filled a little sack with gold <br/>
dust and sent it to me to assist me on my mission.</p>

<p>By the sale of this treasure from California I was enabled to <br/>
emigrate myself, family and a number of others to Zion in <br/>
the mountains.</p>

<p>He also said I should have power to bring my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and his <br/>
family into the Church. This was fulfilled when I visited them <br/>
during my mission to the [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]], as previously related.</p>

<p>My father gathered to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] with the Saints, and <br/>
he died there, aged 83 years.</p>

<p>The Patriarch also said I should be wrapt in the visions of <br/>
heaven, and an angel of God should teach me many things. <br/>
This was literally fulfilled.</p>

<p>Again, he told me I should be delivered from my enemies <br/>
(who would seek my destruction) by the mighty power of God</p>",
671.0,107,,"<p>STRUGGLE WITH EVIL SPIRITS.</p>

<p>and the administrations of angels. This was marvelously ful-<br/>
filled while in the city of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] in 1840. Brothers [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber <br/>
C. Kimball]], [[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]] and I went to London <br/>
together in the winter of 1840, being the first Elders who had <br/>
attempted to established the gospel in that great and mighty <br/>
city.</p>

<p>As soon as we commenced we found the [[Devil|devil]] was manifest; <br/>
the [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] gathered for our destruction, and at times they <br/>
had great power.</p>

<p>They would destroy all the Saints if they were not restrained <br/>
by the power of God.</p>

<p>Brother Smith and myself were together, and had retired <br/>
to our rest, each occupying a cot, and but three feet apart.</p>

<p>We had only just lain down, when it seemed as if a legion <br/>
of devils made war upon us, to destroy us, and we were strug-<br/>
gling for our lives in the midst of this warfare of evil spirits <br/>
until we were nearly choked to death.</p>

<p>I began to pray the best that I could in the midst of this <br/>
struggle and asked the Father in the name of Jesus Christ to <br/>
spare our lives.</p>

<p>While thus praying three personages entered the room, <br/>
clothed in white and encircled with light.</p>

<p>They walked to our bedside, laid hands upon our heads and <br/>
we were instantly delivered; and from that time forth we <br/>
were no more troubled with evil spirits while in the city of <br/>
London.</p>

<p>As soon as they administered unto us they withdrew from <br/>
the room, the lights withdrew with them and darkness <br/>
returned.</p>

<p>Many other sayings of the Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] in my <br/>
blessing have been fulfilled in my experience, but I have said <br/>
sufficient on this subject. All the blessings that are sealed <br/>
upon our heads will be fulfilled, and many more, if we are <br/>
faithful and live for them.</p>

<p>In closing my testimony I wish to say that I do not think <br/>
that the Lord ever sends an [[angel|angel]] to the earth to visit the <br/>
children of men, unless it is necessary to introduce a dispen-<br/>
sation of the gospel, or deliver a message, or perform a work <br/>
that cannot be done otherwise.</p>",
671.0,108,,"<p>THE END.</p>

<p>It required an [[Moroni (BofM)|angel]] of God to deliver the gospel to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph <br/>
Smith]] because it was not then upon the earth, and that was <br/>
in fulfillment of the word of the Lord through [[John (NT)|John]] the <br/>
Revelator (<i>##Revelation 14:6|Revelations xiv</i>. 6##). And so in regard to the <br/>
administrations of angels in all ages of the world; it is to <br/>
deliver a message and perform a work which cannot otherwise <br/>
be accomplished.<br/>

671.0,21,,"<p>REFUSED FOOD AND SHELTER.</p>

<p>In some instances the Lord preserved us, as it were by <br/>
miracle, from the mob.</p>

<p>We dared not go to houses and get food, so we picked and <br/>
ate raw corn, and slept on the ground, and did any way we <br/>
could until we got out of the [[Jackson County, Missouri|County]].</p>

<p>We dared not preach while in that County, and we did but <br/>
little preaching in the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]]. The first time I <br/>
attempted to preach was on Sunday, in a tavern, in the early <br/>
part of December, 1834. It was snowing at the time, and the <br/>
room was full of people. As I commenced to speak the land-<br/>
lord opened the door, and the snow blew on the people; and <br/>
when I inquired the object of having the door opened in a <br/>
snowstorm, he informed me that he wanted some light on the <br/>
subject. I found that it was the custom of the country.</p>

<p>How much good I did in that sermon I never knew, and <br/>
probably never shall know until I meet that congregation in <br/>
judgment.</p>

<p>In the southern portion of Missouri and the northern part <br/>
of [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], in 1834, there were but very few inhabitants.</p>

<p>We visited a place called [[Harmony Mission, Bates County, Missouri|Harmony Mission]], on the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage <br/>
river]], one of the most crooked rivers in the west. This mis-<br/>
sion was kept by a [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] minister and his family.</p>

<p>We arrived there on Sunday night at sunset. We had<br/>
walked all day with nothing to eat, and were very hungry and <br/>
tired. Neither the minister nor his wife would give us any-<br/>
thing to eat, nor let us stay overnight, because we were <br/>
“Mormons,"" and the only chance we had was to go twelve <br/>
miles farther down the river, to an [[Osage People|Osage]] Indian trading <br/>
post, kept by a Frenchman named [[Michel Geraud|Jereu]]. And this wicked <br/>
priest, who would not give us a piece of bread, lied to us <br/>
about the road, and sent us across the swamp, and we wallowed <br/>
knee deep in mud and water till ten o'clock at night in try-<br/>
ing to follow this crooked river. We then left the swamp, <br/>
and put out into the prairie, to lie in the grass for the night. <br/>
When we came out of the swamp, we heard an Indian <br/>
drumming on a tin pail and singing. It was very dark, but <br/>
we traveled towards the noise, and when we drew near the <br/>
Indian camp quite a number of large Indian dogs came out <br/>
to meet us. They smelt us, but did not bark nor bite.</p>",

<p>We were soon surrounded by [[Osage People|Osage Indians]], and kindly <br/>
received by [[Michel Geraud|Mr. Jereu]] and his [[Mrs. Michael Geraud|wife]], who was an Indian. She <br/>
gave us an excellent supper and a good bed, which we were <br/>
thankful for after the fatigue of the day.</p>

<p>As I laid my head on my pillow I felt to thank God, from <br/>
the bottom of my heart, for the exchange of the barbarous <br/>
treatment of a civilized [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] priest, for the humane, <br/>
kind and generous treatment of the savage Osage Indians.</p>

ITS INMATES—NO SUPPER—SLEEP ON THE FLOOR—THE <br/>
HARDEST DAY'S WORK OF MY LIFE—TWELVE MILES <br/>
MORE WITHOUT BREAKFAST—BREAKFAST AND ABUSE <br/>
TOGETHER.</p>

<p>WE arose in the morning, after a good night's rest. I was <br/>
somewhat lame, from wading in the swamp the night <br/>
before. We had a good breakfast. [[Michel Geraud|Mr. Jereu]] sent an Indian <br/>
to see us across the [[Osage River, Missouri|river]], and informed us that it was sixty <br/>
miles to the nearest settlement of either white or red men.</p>

<p>We were too bashful to ask for anything to take with us to <br/>
eat; so we crossed the river and started on our day's journey <br/>
of sixty miles without a morsel of food of any kind. What <br/>
for? To preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, to save this gen-<br/>
eration.</p>

<p>Think of this, children; think of what the Presidency <br/>
the Apostles, and the Elders of this Church have passed <br/>
through to give you the homes and comforts you now enjoy.</p>

<p>Think of this, ye statesmen and judges of this American <br/>
nation; ye who are now seeking to destroy God's people in <br/>
the wilderness, who have gone hungry and naked and have <br/>
labored for fifty years to save this nation and generation.</p>",
671.0,23,,"<p>CONFRONTED BY A BEAR.</p>

<p>Cease your exertions to destroy this people, or God will bring <br/>
you to judgment and destroy your nation, and cast you into <br/>
[[outer darkness|outer darkness]], where there shall be weeping and gnashing of <br/>
teeth; for the Lord God has spoken it. I must pause; I almost <br/>
forgot I was writing a narrative.</p>

<p>We started about sunrise and crossed a thirty mile prairie, <br/>
apparently as level as a house floor, without shrub or water. <br/>
We arrived at timber about two o'clock in the afternoon. As <br/>
we approached the timber a large black bear came out towards <br/>
us. We were not afraid of him, for we were on the Lord's <br/>
business, and had not mocked God's prophets as did the forty-<br/>
two wicked children who said to [[Elisha (OT)|Elisha]] ""Go up thou bald<br/>
head,"" for which they were torn by bears.</p>

<p>When the bear got within eight rods of us he sat on his <br/>
haunches and looked at us a moment, and then ran away; and <br/>
we went on our way rejoicing. We had to travel in the night, <br/>
which was cloudy and very dark, so we had great difficulty to <br/>
keep the road. Soon a large drove of wolves gathered around, <br/>
and followed us. They came very close, and at times it <br/>
seemed as though they would eat us up.</p>

<p>We had materials for striking alight, and at ten o'clock, not <br/>
knowing where we were, and the wolves becoming so bold, we <br/>
thought it wisdom to make a fire; so we stopped and gathered <br/>
a lot of oak limbs that lay on the ground, and lit them, and <br/>
as our fire began to burn the wolves left us.</p>

<p>As we were about to lay down on the ground—for we had <br/>
no blankets—we heard a dog bark.</p>

<p>My [[Henry Brown|companion]] said it was a wolf; I said it was a dog: but <br/>
soon we heard a cow bell. Then we each took a firebrand and <br/>
went about a quarter of a mile, and found the house, which <br/>
was sixty miles from where we started that morning.</p>

<p>It was an old log cabin, about twelve feet square, with no <br/>
door, but an old blanket was hung up in the door-way. There <br/>
was no furniture except one bedstead, upon which lay a woman, <br/>
several children and several small dogs. A man lay on the <br/>
bare floor with his feet to the fireplace, and all were asleep. <br/>
I went in and spoke to the man, but did not wake him. I <br/>
stepped to him, and laid my hand on his shoulder. The <br/>
moment he felt the weight of my hand he jumped to his </p>",
671.0,24,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>feet, and ran around the room as though he was frightened; <br/>
but he was quieted when we informed him we were friends.</p>

<p>The cause of his fright was, he had shot a panther a few <br/>
nights before, and he thought its mate had jumped upon <br/>
him.</p>

<p>He asked us what we wanted; we told him we wished to <br/>
stop with him all night, and would like something to eat. He <br/>
informed us we might lay on the floor as he did, but that he <br/>
had not a mouthful for us to eat, as he had to depend on his <br/>
gun to get breakfast for his family in the morning. So we <br/>
lay on the bare floor, and slept through a long, rainy night, <br/>
which was pretty hard after walking sixty miles without any-<br/>
thing to eat. That was the hardest day's work of my life.</p>

<p>The man's name was Williams. He was in the mob in<br/>
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]; and after the Saints were driven out, he, <br/>
with many others, went south.</p>

<p>We got up in the morning and walked in the rain twelve <br/>
miles to the house of a man named Bemon, who was also <br/>
one of the mob from Jackson County. They were about <br/>
sitting down to breakfast as we came in.</p>

<p>In those days it was the custom of the Missourians to ask <br/>
you to eat even if they intended to cut your throat as soon as <br/>
you got through; so he asked us to take breakfast, and we <br/>
were very glad of the invitation.</p>

<p>He knew we were ""Mormons;"" and as soon as we began to <br/>
eat he began to swear about the ""Mormons."" He had a large <br/>
platter of bacon and eggs, and plenty of bread on the table, <br/>
and his swearing did not hinder our eating, for the harder he <br/>
swore the harder we ate, until we got our stomachs full; <br/>
then we arose from the table, took our hats, thanked him for <br/>
our breakfast, and the last we heard of him he was still <br/>

<p>OUR ANXIETY TO MEET A SAINT—JOURNEY TO AKEMAN'S—<br/>
A DREAM—FIND MR. AKEMAN A RANK APOSTATE—HE <br/>
RAISES A MOB—THREATENED WITH TAR, FEATHERS, <br/>
ETC.—I WARN MR. AKEMAN TO REPENT—HE FALLS DEAD <br/>
AT MY FEET—I PREACH HIS FUNERAL SERMON.</p>

<p>IN the early days of the Church, it was a great treat to an <br/>
Elder in his travels through the country to find a ""Mor-<br/>
mon;"" it was so with us. We were hardly in [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] when <br/>
we heard of a family named Akeman. They were in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson <br/>
County]] in the persecutions. Some of the sons had been tied <br/>
up there and whipped on their bare backs with hickory switches <br/>
by the mob. We heard of their living on [[Petit Jean River, Arkansas Territory|Petit Jean River]], in <br/>
the Arkansas Territory, and we went a long way to visit them.</p>

<p>There had recently been heavy rains, and a creek that we had <br/>
to cross was swollen to a rapid stream of eight rods in width. <br/>
There was no person living nearer than two miles from the <br/>
crossing, and no boat. The people living at the last house <br/>
on the road, some three miles from the crossing, said we would <br/>
have to tarry till the water fell before we could cross. We did <br/>
not stop, feeling to trust in God.</p>

<p>Just as we arrived at the rolling flood a [[Negro|negro]], on a powerful <br/>
horse, entered the stream on the opposite side and rode <br/>
through it. On our making our wants known to him, he took <br/>
us, one at a time, behind him and carried us safely over, and <br/>
we went on our way rejoicing.</p>

<p>We arrived that night within five miles of Mr. Akeman's, <br/>
and were kindly entertained by a stranger. During the <br/>
night I had the following dream:</p>

<p>I thought an angel came to us, and told us we were com-<br/>
manded of the Lord to follow a certain straight path, which <br/>
was pointed out to us, let it lead us wherever it might. After <br/>
we had walked in it awhile we came to the door of a house, <br/>
which was in the line of a high wall running north and south, <br/>
so that we could not go around. I opened the door and saw</p>",
671.0,26,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>the room was filled with large serpents, and I shuddered at <br/>
the sight. My [[Henry Brown|companion]] said he would not go into the room <br/>
for fear of the serpents. I told him I should try to go through <br/>
the room though they killed me, for the Lord had commanded <br/>
it. As I stepped into the room the serpents coiled themselves <br/>
up, and raised their heads some two feet from the floor, to <br/>
spring at me. There was one much larger than the rest in <br/>
the center of the room, which raised his head nearly as high <br/>
as mine and made a spring at me. At that instant I felt as <br/>
though nothing but the [[power of God|power of God]] could save me, and I <br/>
stood still. Just before the serpent reached me he dropped <br/>
dead at my feet; all the rest dropped dead, swelled up, turned <br/>
black, burst open, took fire and were consumed before my <br/>
eyes, and we went through the room unharmed, and thanked <br/>
God for our deliverance.</p>

<p>I awoke in the morning and pondered upon the dream. <br/>
We took breakfast, and started on our journey on Sunday <br/>
morning, to visit Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Akeman]]. I related to my companion <br/>
my dream, and told him we should see something strange. <br/>
We had great anticipations of meeting Mr. Akeman, suppos-<br/>
ing him to be a member of the Church. When we arrived at <br/>
his house he received us very coldly, and we soon found that <br/>
he had [[apostatized|apostatized]]. He brought railing accusations against <br/>
the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] and the authorities of the Church.</p>

<p>Word was sent through all the settlements on the river for <br/>
twenty miles that two ""Mormon"" preachers were in the place. <br/>
A mob was soon raised, and warning sent to us to leave <br/>
immediately or we would be tarred and feathered, ridden on a <br/>
rail and hanged. I soon saw where the serpents were. My <br/>
companion wanted to leave; I told him no, I would stay and <br/>
see my dream fulfilled.</p>

<p>There was an old [[Jonathan Hubbel|gentleman]] and [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|lady]], named Hubbel, who <br/>
had read the Book of Mormon and believed. Father Hubbell <br/>
came to see us, and invited us to make our home with him <br/>
while we stayed in the place. We did so, and labored for him <br/>
some three weeks with our axes, clearing land, while we were <br/>
waiting to see the salvation of God.</p>

<p>I was commanded of the Lord by the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] to go <br/>
and warn Mr. Akeman to repent of his wickedness. I did so, and</p>",
671.0,27,1835-03-11,"<p>MR. [[Alexander Akeman|AKEMAN]] DROPS DEAD.</p>

<p>each time he railed against me, and the last time he ordered <br/>
me out of his house. When I went out he followed me and <br/>
was very angry. When he came up to me, about eight rods <br/>
from the house, he fell dead at my feet, turned black and <br/>
swelled up, as I saw the serpents do in my dream.</p>

<p>His family, as well as ourselves, felt it was the judgment of <br/>
God upon him. I preached his funeral sermon. Many of <br/>
the mob died suddenly. We stayed about two weeks after <br/>
Akeman's death and preached, baptized Mr. [[Jonathan Hubbel|Hubbel]] and his [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|wife]], and then continued on our journey.</p>

FROM THE SPIRIT—NOT WHAT THE AUDIENCE EXPECTED.</p>

<p>WE concluded to go down Arkansas river and cross into [[Tennessee|Tennessee]]. We could not get passage on the boat, <br/>
because of the low water, so we went on the bank of the river <br/>
and cut down a sound cottonwood tree, three feet through, <br/>
and cut off a twelve-foot length from the butt end; and in two <br/>
days we dug out a canoe. We made a pair of oars and a <br/>
rudder, and on the <time datetime=""",03/11/1835
671.0,27,,""">11th of March, 1835</time>, we launched our <br/>
canoe, and commenced our voyage down the Arkansas river, <br/>
without provisions.</p>

<p>The first day we sailed twenty-five miles, and stopped at <br/>
night with a poor family who lived on the bank of the river. <br/>
These kind folks gave us supper and breakfast, and, in the <br/>
morning, gave us a [[johnnycake|johnny cake]] and piece of pork to take <br/>
with us on our journey.</p>",
671.0,28,1835-03-24,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>We traveled about fifty miles that day, and at night stopped <br/>
at an old tavern, in a village called [[Cadron Creek, Arkansas Territory|Cadron]], which <br/>
was deserted because it was believed to be haunted by evil <br/>
spirits.</p>

<p>We made a fire in the tavern, roasted a piece of our pork, <br/>
ate our supper, said our prayers, went into a chamber, lay <br/>
down on the bare floor, and were soon asleep.</p>

<p>I dreamed I was at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house in a good feather bed, <br/>
and I had a good night's rest. When I awoke the bed vanished, <br/>
and I found myself on the bare floor and well rested, not <br/>
having been troubled with [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] or anything else.</p>

<p>We thanked the Lord for His goodness to us, ate the <br/>
remainder of our provisions and continued our journey down <br/>
the river to [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little Rock]], the capital of [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], which then <br/>
consisted of only a few cabins.</p>

<p>After visiting the place, we crossed the river and tied up <br/>
our canoe, which had carried us safely one hundred and fifty <br/>
miles.</p>

<p>We then took the old military road, leading from Little <br/>
Rock to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee. This road lay through swamps, <br/>
and was covered with mud and water most of the way, for one <br/>
hundred and seventy miles. We walked forty miles in a day <br/>
through mud and water knee deep.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",03/24/1835
671.0,28,1835-03-27,""">24th of March</time>, after traveling some ten miles through <br/>
mud, I was taken lame with a sharp pain in my knee. I sat <br/>
down on a log.</p>

<p>My [[Henry Brown|companion]], who was anxious to get to his home in <br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], left me sitting in an alligator swamp. I did not see <br/>
him again for two years. I knelt down in the mud and <br/>
prayed, and the Lord healed me, and I went on my way <br/>
rejoicing.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",03/27/1835
671.0,28,,""">27th of March</time>, I arrived at Memphis, weary and <br/>
hungry. I went to the best tavern in the place, kept by Mr. <br/>
[[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]]. I told him I was a stranger, and had no <br/>
money. I asked him if he would keep me over night.</p>

<p>He inquired of me what my business was.</p>

<p>I told him I was a preacher of the gospel.</p>

<p>He laughed, and said that I did not look much like a <br/>
preacher.</p>",
671.0,29,,"<p>COMPELLED TO PREACH.</p>

<p>I did not blame him, as all the preachers he had ever been<br/>
acquainted with rode on fine horses or in fine carriages, clothed<br/>
in broadcloth, and had large salaries, and would see this<br/>
whole world sink to perdition before they would wade through<br/>
one hundred and seventy miles of mud to save the people.</p>

<p>The [[Josiah Jackson|landlord]] wanted a little fun, so he said he would<br/>
keep me if I would preach.  He wanted to see if I could<br/>
preach.</p>

<p>I must confess that by this time I became a little mischiev-<br/>
ous, and pleaded with him not to set me preaching.</p>

<p>The more I plead to be excused, the more determined Mr.<br/>
Jackson was that I should preach. He took my valise, and<br/>
the landlady got me a good supper.</p>

<p>I sat down in a large hall to eat supper. Before I got<br/>
through, the room began to be filled by some of the rich and<br/>
fashionable of [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], dressed in their broadcloth and<br/>
silk, while my appearance was such as you can imagine, after<br/>
traveling through the mud as I had been.</p>

<p>When I had finished eating, the table was carried out of<br/>
the room over the heads of the people. I was placed in the <br/>
corner of the room, with a stand having a [[Bible|Bible]], hymn book<br/>
and candle on it, hemmed in by a dozen men, with the land-<br/>
lord in the center.</p>

<p>There were present some five hundred persons who had<br/>
come together, not to hear a gospel sermon, but to have some<br/>
fun.</p>

<p>Now, boys, how would you like this position? On your <br/>
first mission, without a companion or friend, and to be called<br/>
upon to preach to such a congregation! With me it was<br/>
one of the most pleasing hours of my life, although I felt as<br/>
though I should like company.</p>

<p>I read a hymn, and asked them to sing. Not a soul would<br/>
sing a word.</p>

<p>I told them I had not the gift of singing; but with the<br/>
help of the Lord, I would both pray and preach. I knelt<br/>
down to pray, and the men around me dropped on their<br/>
knees. I prayed to the Lord to give me His Spirit and to <br/>
show me the hearts of the people. I promised the Lord in my <br/>
prayer I would deliver to that congregation whatever He</p>

<p><i>1</i>*</p>",
671.0,30,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>would give to me. I arose and spoke one hour and a half and<br/>
it was one of the best sermons of my life.</p>

<p>The lives of the congregation were opened to the vision of<br/>
my mind, and I told them of their wicked deeds and the<br/>
reward they would obtain. The men who surrounded me<br/>
dropped their heads. Three minutes after I closed I was the<br/>
only person in the room.</p>

<p>Soon I was shown to a bed, and in a room adjoining a large one<br/>
in which were assembled many of the men whom I had been <br/>
preaching to. I could hear their conversation.</p>

<p>One man said he would like to know how that ""Mormon""<br/>
boy knew of their past lives.</p>

<p>In a little while they got to disputing about some doctrinal<br/>
point. One suggested calling me to decide the point. The<br/>
[[Josiah Jackson|landlord]] said, ""no; we have had enough for once.""</p>

<p>In the morning, I had a good breakfast. The landlord said<br/>
if I came that way again to stop at his house, and stay as long<br/>
as I might choose.</p>

He had been preaching in that part of [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in company<br/>
with [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]], and had baptized a number and organ-<br/>
ized several small branches.</p>

<p>Brother Patten had returned home, and Brother Parrish<br/>
was laboring alone. I joined him in the ministry, and we<br/>
labored together three months and nineteen days, when he<br/>
was called to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]].</p>

<p>During the time we were together we traveled through<br/>
several Counties in Tennessee for the distance of seven hun-<br/>
dred and sixty miles, and preached the gospel daily, as we had<br/>
opportunity. We baptized some twenty persons.</p>

<p>By the counsel of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver<br/>
Cowdery]], Elder Parrish ordained me an [[Elder|Elder]], and left me to<br/>
take charge of the branches that had been raised up in that<br/>
neighborhood.</p>

<p>As soon as I was left alone I extended my circuit and labors.<br/>
For a season I had large congregations; many seemed to<br/>
believe, and I baptized a number.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",08/15/1835
671.0,31,1835-10-20,""">15th of August</time> I had an appointment at the house<br/>
of Brother [[Levi Taylor|Taylor]], the step-father of [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Abraham O. Smoot]].</p>

<p>I had to cross [[Blood River, Henry County, Tennessee|Bloody River]], which I had to swim in con-<br/>
sequence of heavy rains. While crossing, my horse became<br/>
entangled in a tree top, and almost drowned; but I succeeded<br/>
in getting him loose.</p>

<p>We swam to the shore separately. He reached the shore<br/>
first, and waited till I came out. I got into the saddle, and<br/>
went on my way in good spirits, and had a good meeting.</p>

under General [[George Washington|Washington]]. His [[Elizabeth Greenwood|wife]], who was ninety-three<br/>

River]], in company with [[Seth Utley|Seth Utley]], four other brethren and<br/>
two sisters. The distance was twenty miles.</p>

<p>We came to a stream, which was so swollen by rains, that<br/>
we could not cross without swimming our horses. To swim<br/>
would not be safe for the females, so we went up the stream<br/>
to find a ford. In the attempt we were overtaken by a severe<br/>
storm of wind and rain, and lost our way in the darkness, and<br/>
wandered through creeks and mud. But the Lord does not<br/>
forsake His Saints in any of their troubles. While we were<br/>
in the woods suffering under the blast of the storm, groping<br/>
like the blind for the wall, a bright light suddenly shone<br/>
around us, and revealed to us our dangerous situation on the<br/>
edge of a gulf. The light continued with us until we found<br/>
the road; we then went on our way rejoicing, though the<br/>
darkness returned and the rain continued.</p>

<p>We reached Brother [[Henry Thomas Jr.|Henry Thomas']] in safety about nine<br/>
o'clock at night, having been five hours in the storm and<br/>
forded streams many times. None of us felt to complain, <br/>

while he told them of their wickedness and the abominations<br/>
that they were guilty of, also of the curse of God that awaited<br/>
them, if they did not repent, for taking up two harmless, <br/>
inoffensive men for preaching the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>When he had got through his speech the judge said, ""You<br/>
must be armed with secret weapons, or you would not talk in<br/>
this fearless manner to an armed court.""</p>

<p>Brother Patten replied; ""I have weapons that you know<br/>
not of, and they are given me of God, for He gives me all the<br/>
power I have.""</p>

<p>The judge seemed willing to get rid of them almost upon<br/>
any terms, and offered to dismiss them if their friends would<br/>
pay the costs, which the brethren present freely offered to do.</p>

<p>When the two were released, they mounted their horses and<br/>
rode a mile to [[Seth Utley|Seth Utley's]]; but, as soon as they had left, the<br/>
court became ashamed that they had been let go so easily<br/>
and the whole mob mounted their horses to follow them to<br/>
Utley's.</p>

<p>One of the Saints, seeing the state of affairs, went on<br/>
before the mob to notify the brethren, so that they had time<br/>
to ride into the woods near by.</p>

<p>They traveled along about three miles to Brother [[Albert Petty|Albert<br/>
Petty's]], and went to bed. The night was dark, and they fell <br/>
asleep.</p>

<p>But Brother Patten was warned in a dream to get up and <br/>
flee, as the mob would soon be there. They both arose,<br/>
saddled their animals, and rode into the adjoining County.</p>

<p>The house they had just left was soon surrounded by the<br/>
mob, but the brethren had escaped through the mercy of God.</p>",

tion; but, on commencing meeting, [[Parson Browning|Parson Browning]] ordered<br/>
the meeting to be closed. I told the people I had come ten<br/>
miles to preach the gospel to them, and was willing to stand<br/>
in a cart, on a pile of wood, on a fence, or any other place<br/>
they would appoint, to have that privilege.</p>

<p>One man said he owned the fence and land in front of the<br/>
meeting-house, and we might use both, for he did not believe<br/>
""Mormonism"" would hurt either.</p>

<p>So the congregation crossed the road, took down the fence<br/>
and made seats of it, and I preached to them one hour and a <br/>
half. At the close Mr. [[Randolph Alexander|Randolph Alexander]] bore testimony<br/>
to the truth of what had been said. He invited me home<br/>
with him, bought a [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], and was baptized, and<br/>
I organized a branch in that place.</p>

a ferry on the [[Tennessee River, United States|Tennessee river]], and, as the ferryman was not<br/>
at home, the woman kindly gave us permission to use the<br/>
ferryboat. We led our horses on board, and took the oars to<br/>
cross the river. Brother Smoot had never used an oar, and I <br/>
had not for some years, so we made awkward work of it.<br/>
Soon he broke one oar, and I let another fall overboard, which <br/>
left us only one broken oar to get to shore with. We narrowly<br/>
escaped running into a steamboat. We struck shore half a<br/>
mile below the landing place, tied up the boat, jumped on<br/>
the bank with our horses, and went on our way with blistered<br/>
hands, thankful to get off so well.</p>

threatened us, and poisoned our horses so that the one I rode, <br/>
belonging to [[Samuel Walker West|Samuel West]], died a few days after. This horse<br/>
had carried me thousands of miles while preaching the gospel.</p>

<p>HAVING returned from my Southern mission in the <br/>
autumn of 1836, in company with Elders [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] <br/>
and [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpin]], I spent the following winter in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. <br/>
During this time I received my [[endowments|endowments]] and attended the <br/>
school of Professor [[H. M. Hawes|Haws]], who taught [[Greek|Greek]], [[Latin|Latin]] and <br/>
English grammar. I confined my studies mostly to Latin and English grammar.</p>

<p>This winter and the following spring, in some respects, may <br/>
be regarded as one of the most interesting periods of the history <br/>
of the Church, when we consider the endowments and teach-<br/>
ings given in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|temple]], and the great apostasy which <br/>
followed.</p>

<p>I was married to Miss Phoebe Whitmore Carter, on the <br/>
<time datetime=""",04/13/1837
671.0,37,,""">13th of April, 1837</time>, and received my patriarchal blessing</p>",
671.0,38,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>under the hands of Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]], the Patriarch, two <br/>
days later.</p>

<p>I felt impressed by the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] to take a mission <br/>
to the [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]], situated east of the [[Maine|Maine]] shore, a country I <br/>
knew nothing about. I made my feelings known to the <br/>
Apostles, and they advised me to go.</p>

<p>Feeling that it was my duty to go upon this mission, I did <br/>
not tarry at home one year after having married a [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]], as the <br/>
law of [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] would have allowed. On the contrary, I started <br/>
just one month and one day after that important event, leav-<br/>
ing my wife with Sister [[Olive Boynton Hale|Hale]], with whom she expected to <br/>
stay for a season.</p>

<p>I left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] in good spirits, in company with Elder <br/>
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan H. Hale]], and walked twelve miles to [[Fairport, Geauga County, Ohio|Fairport]], where we <br/>
were joined by Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. There we went aboard <br/>
the steamer <i>Sandusky</i>, and made our way to [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]], and pro-<br/>
ceeded thence to [[Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York|Syracuse]], by way of the [[Erie, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie Canal]]. We <br/>
then walked to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego Co., N. Y., where I met <br/>
my [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|two]] [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|brothers]], whom I had not seen for several years.</p>

<p>After spending one night there, we continued our journey <br/>
to [[Sackets Harbor, Jefferson County, New York|Sackett's Harbor]], and crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]] on the steamer <br/>
<i>Oneida</i>, to [[Kingston, Frontenac County, Canada West, British North America|Kingston]], Upper Canada, and from there also by <br/>
steamer along the canal to [[Jones Falls, Canada West, British North America|Jones' Falls]], whence we walked to <br/>
a place called [[Bastard, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Bastard]], Leeds County.</p>

<p>Here we found a branch of the Church, presided over by <br/>
[[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and [[James Blakesly|James Blakesly]]. We accompanied them <br/>
to their place of meeting, and attended a conference with <br/>
them, at which three hundred members of the Church were <br/>
represented.</p>

<p>Thirty-two persons presented themselves for ordination, <br/>
whom I was requested to ordain, in company with Elder [[William Draper|Wm. <br/>
Draper]]. We ordained seven Elders, nine Priests, eleven <br/>
Teachers and five Deacons.</p>

<p>We spoke to the people several times during this conf-<br/>
erence, and at its close we were called upon to administer to a <br/>
woman who was possessed of the devil. At times she was <br/>
dumb, and greatly afflicted with the [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] that dwelt in <br/>
her. She believed in Jesus and in us as His servants, and <br/>
wished us to administer to her. Four of us [[laying on of hands|laid]] our hands</p>",

Jesus Christ, to depart out of her. It was immediately done, <br/>
and the woman arose with great joy, and gave thanks and <br/>
praise unto God; for, according to her faith, she was made <br/>
whole from that hour.</p>

<p>A child, also, that was sick, was healed by the [[laying on of hands|laying on of <br/>
hands]], according to the word of God.</p>

<p>We walked thirty miles to visit another branch of the <br/>
Saints at [[Leeds Township, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Leeds]], where we met with [[John Gordon|John Gordon]] and [[John Snider|John <br/>
Snider]]. Here we held a meeting and bore our testimony to <br/>
the people.</p>

<p>A Sister [[Irvin B. Carnes|Carns]] here came to us and requested to have the <br/>
ordinance for the healing of the sick performed for two of <br/>
her children who were afflicted. One was a suckling child, <br/>
which was lying at the point of death. I took it in my arms <br/>
and presented it before the Elders, who laid their hands upon <br/>
it, and it was made whole immediately, and I handed it back <br/>
to the mother entirely healed.</p>

<p>We afterwards laid hands upon the other, when it was also <br/>
healed. It was done by the [[power of God|power of God]], in the name of <br/>
Jesus Christ, and the parents praised God for His goodness.</p>

<p>After leaving the Saints in this place, we returned to [[Kingston, Frontenac County, Canada West, British North America|Kings-<br/>
ton]], and crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]] in company with [[Isaac Russell|Isaac Russell]], <br/>
[[John Goodson|John Goodson]] and John Snider.</p>

<p>Brother Russell seemed to be constantly troubled with [[evil spirits|evil <br/>

a mission to [[England|England]], where Apostles [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber <br/>

with them, as Brother Kimball has related in his history.</p>

<p>Brothers Russell, Goodson and Snider continued with us to <br/>
[[Schenectady, Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]], where they left us to proceed to [[New York|New York]], to <br/>
join Elders Kimball and Hyde to go upon their mission to <br/>
England.</p>

<p>After leaving these brethren we traveled by rail to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]], <br/>
and walked from there to [[Canaan, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Canaan]], Conn., where we found a <br/>
branch of the Church, including [[Jesse Tilton Moses|Jesse]] and [[Julian Moses|Julian Moses]] and <br/>
[[Francis K. Benedict|Francis K. Benedict]].</p>

ing school there, I proceeded to [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], the place of my birth. <br/>

Just in her dealings, faithful to her friend, <br/>

<p>At the close of the day I walked six miles to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], <br/>
where my father, [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]], was living, and I had the <br/>
happy privilege of once more meeting with him and my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-<br/>
mother]], whom I had not seen for seven years. They greeted <br/>
me with great kindness, and it was a happy meeting.</p>

<p>ABOUT nine months have elapsed since the first edition of <br/>
this work was published, and now the whole number <br/>
issued—over 4,000 copies—are exhausted, and there is a <br/>
demand for more.</p>

<p>We, therefore, have much pleasure in offering the Second <br/>
Edition of LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL for public consider-<br/>
ation, and trust that the young people who pursue it will be <br/>
inspired to emulate in their lives the faith, perseverance and <br/>
integrity that so distinguish its author.</p>

<p>Brother Woodruff is a remarkable man. Few men now <br/>
living, who have followed the quiet and peaceful pursuits of <br/>
life, have had such an interesting and eventful experience as <br/>
he has. Few, if any in this age, have spent a more active <br/>
and useful life. Certainly no man living has been more par-<br/>
ticular about recording with his own hand, in a daily journal, <br/>
during half a century, the events of his own career and the <br/>
things that have come under his observation. His elaborate <br/>
journal has always been one of the principal sources from <br/>
which the Church history has been compiled.</p>

<p>Possessed of wonderful energy and determination, and <br/>
mighty faith, Brother Woοkruff has labored long and with <br/>
great success in the Church. He has ever had a definite <br/>
object in view—to know the will of the Almighty and to do it. <br/>
No amount of self-denial has been too great for him to cheer-<br/>
fully endure for the advancement of the cause of God. No <br/>
labor required of the Saints has been considered by him too <br/>
onerous to engage in with his own hands.<br/>

671.0,8,,"<p>PREFACE.</p>

<p>[[Satan|Satan]], knowing the power for good that Brother Woodruff<br/>
would be, if permitted to live, has often sought to effect his <br/>
destruction.</p>

<p>The adventures, accidents and hair-breath escapes that he <br/>
has met with, are scarcely equalled by the record that the for-<br/>
mer apostle, [[Paul (NT)|Paul]], has left us of his life.</p>

<p>The power of God has been manifested in a most remarkable <br/>
manner in preserving Brother Woodruf's life. Considering <br/>
the number of bones he has had broken, and the other bodily <br/>
injuries he has received, it is certainly wonderful that now, at <br/>
the age of seventy-five years, he is such a sound, well-pre-<br/>
served man. God grant that his health and usefulness may <br/>
continue for many years to come.</p>

<p>Of course, this volume contains but a small portion of the <br/>
interesting experience of Brother Woodruff's life, but very <br/>
many profitable lessons may be learned from it, and we trust <br/>
at some future time to be favored with other sketches from <br/>
his pen.</p>

OLD PROPHET, [[Robert Mason|MASON]]—HIS VISION—HIS PROPHECY—<br/>
HEAR THE GOSPEL, AND EMBRACE IT—VISIT [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|KIRTLAND]] <br/>
AND SEE [[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH SMITH]]—A WORK FOR THE OLD <br/>
PROPHET.</p>

<p>FOR the benefit of the young Latter-day Saints, for whom <br/>
the Faith-Promoting Series is especially designed, I will <br/>
relate some incidents from my experience. I will commence <br/>
by giving a short account of some events of my childhood <br/>
and youth.</p>

<p>I spent the first years of my life under the influence of what <br/>
history has called the ""[[Blue Laws|Blue Laws]]"" of Connecticut.</p>

<p>No man, boy, or child of any age was permitted to play, or <br/>
do any work from sunset Saturday night, until Sunday night. <br/>
After sunset on Sunday evening, men might work, and boys <br/>
might jump, shout, and play as much as they pleased.</p>

<p>Our parents were very strict with us on Saturday night, <br/>
and all day Sunday we had to sit very still and say over the <br/>
[[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] catechism and some passages in the [[Bible|Bible]].</p>

<p>The people of Connecticut in those days thought it wicked <br/>
to believe in any religion, or belong to any church, except the <br/>
Presbyterian. They did not believe in having any prophets, <br/>
apostles, or revelations, as they had in the days of Jesus, and <br/>
as we now have in the [[Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day <br/>
Saints]].</p>

<p>There was an aged man in Connecticut, however, by the <br/>
name of [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], who did not believe like the rest of <br/>
the people. He believed it was necessary to have prophets</p>",
671.0,14,,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>apostles, dreams, visions and revelations in the church of <br/>
Christ, the same as they had who lived in ancient days; and <br/>
he believed the Lord would raise up a people and a church, <br/>
in the last days, with prophets, apostles and all the gifts, <br/>
powers and blessings, which it ever contained in any age of <br/>
the world.</p>

<p>The people called this man, the old prophet [[Robert Mason|Mason]].</p>

<p>He frequently came to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house when I was a <br/>
boy, and taught me and my brothers those principles; and I <br/>
believed him.</p>

<p>This prophet prayed a great deal, and he had dreams and <br/>
visions, and the Lord showed him many things, by visions, <br/>
which were to come to pass in the last days.</p>

<p>I will here relate one vision, which he related to me. The <br/>
last time I ever saw him, he said: ""I was laboring in my <br/>
field at mid-day when I was enwrapped in a vision. I was <br/>
placed in the midst of a vast forest of fruit trees: I was <br/>
very hungry, and walked a long way through the orchard, <br/>
searching for fruit to eat; but I could not find any in the <br/>
whole orchard, and I wept because I could find no fruit. <br/>
While I stood gazing at the orchard, and wondering why <br/>
there was no fruit, the trees began to fall to the ground upon <br/>
every side of me, until there was not one tree standing in the <br/>
whole orchard; and while I was marveling at the scene, I saw <br/>
young sprouts start up from the roots of the trees which had <br/>
fallen, and they opened into young, thrifty trees before my <br/>
eyes. They budded, blossomed, and bore fruit until the trees <br/>
were loaded with the finest fruit I ever beheld, and I rejoiced<br/>
to see so much fine fruit. I stepped up to a tree and picked <br/>
my hands full of fruit, and marveled at its beauty, and as <br/>
I was about to taste of it the vision closed, and I found <br/>
myself in the field in the same place I was at the commence-<br/>
ment of the vision.</p>

<p>""I then knelt upon the ground, and prayed unto the Lord, <br/>
and asked Him, in the name of Jesus Christ, to show me the <br/>
meaning of the vision. The Lord said unto me: 'This is the <br/>
interpretation of the vision: the great trees of the forest <br/>
represented the generation of men in which you live. There is <br/>
no church of Christ, or [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]] upon the earth in </p>",
671.0,15,,"<p>I EMBRACE THE GOSPEL.</p>

<p>your generation. There is no fruit of the church of Christ<br/>
upon the earth. There is no man ordained of God to<br/>
administer in any of the ordinances of the gospel of salvation<br/>
upon the earth in this day and generation. But, in the next<br/>
generation, I the Lord will set up my kingdom and my church<br/>
upon the earth, and the fruits of the kingdom and church of<br/>
Christ, such as have followed the prophets, apostles and saints<br/>
in every dispensation, shall again be found in all their fullness<br/>
upon the earth. You will live to see the day, and handle the<br/>
fruit; but will never partake of it in the flesh.' ""</p>

<p>When the old [[Robert Mason|prophet]] had finished relating the vision and<br/>
interpretation, he said to me, calling me by my christian<br/>
name: ""I shall never partake of this fruit in the flesh; but<br/>
you will, and you will become a conspicuous actor in that<br/>
kingdom."" He then turned and left me. These were the<br/>
last words he ever spoke to me upon the earth.</p>

<p>This was a very striking circumstance, as I had spent many<br/>
hours and days, during twenty years, with this old Father<br/>
Mason, and he had never named this vision to me before.<br/>
But at the beginning of this last conversation, he told me that<br/>
he felt impelled by the Spirit of the Lord to relate it to me.</p>

<p>He had the vision about the year 1800, and he related it to<br/>
me in 1830—the same spring that the Church was organized.</p>

<p>This vision, with his other teachings to me, made a great<br/>
impression upon my mind, and I prayed a great deal to the<br/>
Lord to lead me by His Spirit, and prepare me for His church<br/>
when it did come.</p>

<p>In 1832, I left [[Connecticut|Connecticut]], and traveled with my eldest<br/>
[[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|brother]] to [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]], New York; and in the winter of<br/>
1833, I saw, for the first time in my life, an [[Zerah Pulsipher|Elder]] of the<br/>
[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. He preached<br/>
in a school-house near where I lived. I attended the meet-<br/>
ing, and the Spirit of the Lord bore record to me that what<br/>
I heard was true. I invited the Elder to my house, and next<br/>
day I, with my eldest brother, went down into the water and<br/>
was baptized. We were the first two baptized in Oswego<br/>
County, New York.</p>

<p>When I was baptized I thought of what the old prophet<br/>
had said to me.</p>",
671.0,16,1834-04-25,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1834, I went to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], saw the Prophet<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], and went with him, and with more than two<br/>
hundred others in [[Zion|Zion's Camp]], up the [[Missouri|Missouri]]. When I<br/>
arrived at my journey's end, I took the first opportunity and<br/>
wrote a long letter to Father [[Robert Mason|Mason]], and told him I had found<br/>
the church of Christ that he had told me about. I told him<br/>
about its organization and the coming forth of the [[Book of Mormon|Book of<br/>
Mormon]]; that the Church had Prophets, Apostles, and all<br/>
the gifts and blessings in it, and that the true fruit of the<br/>
kingdom and church of Christ were manifest among the<br/>
Saints as the Lord had shown him in the vision. He received<br/>
my letter and read it over many times, and handled it as he<br/>
had handled the fruit in the vision; but he was very aged,<br/>
and soon died. He did not live to see any Elder to administer<br/>
the ordinances of the gospel unto him.</p>

<p>The first opportunity I had, after the doctrine of [[baptism for the dead|baptism<br/>
for the dead]] was revealed, I went forth and was baptized<br/>
for him. He was a good man and a true prophet, for his proph-<br/>
ecies have been fulfilled.</p>

<p>I ARRIVED at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] on the <time datetime=""",04/25/1834
671.0,16,1834-04-27,""">25th of April, 1834</time>, and<br/>
for the first time saw the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]. He<br/>
invited me to his house. I spent about a week with him, and<br/>
became acquainted with him and his family, also with many<br/>
of the Elders and Saints living in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], quite a number<br/>
of whom were preparing to go up to [[Zion|Zion]].</p>

<p>On Sunday, the <time datetime=""",04/27/1834
671.0,16,,""">27th of April</time>, I attended a meeting in a<br/>
school-house in Kirtland, and for the first time heard Elders<br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and others speak<br/>
and bear testimony to the work of God, and much of the<br/>
Spirit of God was poured out upon the Saints.</p>",
671.0,17,1834-04-26,"<p>CAMP OF ZION STARTS.</p>

<p>It was the <time datetime=""",04/26/1834
671.0,17,1834-05-01,""">26th of April, 1834</time>, that I was first introduced<br/>
to Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]]. When I met<br/>
Brother Brigham, he had his hands full of butcher knives;<br/>
he gave me one, and told me to go and put a good handle on<br/>
it, which I did. I also had a good sword, which Brother<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] wanted, and I gave it to him. He carried it all the<br/>
way in [[Zion|Zion's camp]] to [[Missouri|Missouri]], and when he returned home<br/>
he gave it back to me.</p>

<p>When I was called to go on a mission to the South I left the<br/>
sword and knife with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]]. When he was taken<br/>
prisoner at [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], with Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], he had both<br/>
the sword and knife with him. All their weapons were taken<br/>
from them, so were the arms of many of the Saints at Far<br/>
West, under promise that they should be returned to them<br/>
when they were prepared to leave the State. When the<br/>
brethren went to get their arms, Father [[James Allred|James Allred]] saw my<br/>
sword, which Lyman Wight had laid down, and took it and<br/>
left his own, and afterwards gave it to me and I still have it.<br/>
I prize it because the Prophet Joseph carried it in Zion’s<br/>
Camp. The knife I never obtained.</p>

<p>The <time datetime=""",05/01/1834
671.0,17,1834-05-06,""">first day of May, 1834</time>, was appointed for the Camp of<br/>
Zion to start from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] to go up to Missouri for the<br/>
redemption of their brethren. Only a small portion of the<br/>
Camp was ready. The Prophet told those who were ready, to<br/>
go to [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]] and wait for the remainder. I left, in com-<br/>
pany with about twenty men, with the baggage wagons. At<br/>
night we pitched our tents. I went to the top of the hill and<br/>
looked down upon the camp of Israel. I knelt upon the ground<br/>
and prayed. I rejoiced and praised the Lord that I had lived to<br/>
see some of the tents of Israel pitched, and a company gathered<br/>
by the commandment of God to go up and help redeem Zion.</p>

<p>We tarried at New Portage until the <time datetime=""",05/06/1834
671.0,17,1834-05-07,""">6th</time>, when we were<br/>
joined by the Prophet and eighty-five more men. The day<br/>
before they arrived, while passing through the village of [[Middlebury, Mercer County, Missouri|Mid-<br/>
dlebury]], the people tried to count them; but the Lord multi-<br/>
plied them in the eyes of the people, so that those who<br/>
numbered them said there were four hundred of them.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",05/07/1834

sisted of about one hundred and thirty men. On the follow-</p>",
671.0,18,1834-06-19,"<p>LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.</p>

<p>ing day we continued our journey. We pitched our tents at<br/>
night and had prayers night and morning. The [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] told<br/>
us every day what we should do.</p>

<p>We were nearly all young men, gathered from all parts of<br/>
the country, and strangers to each other; but we got acquainted<br/>
very soon, and had a happy time together.</p>

<p>It was a great school for us to be led by a Prophet of God<br/>
thousand miles, through cities, towns, villages, and through<br/>
the wilderness.</p>

<p>When persons stood by to count us they could not tell how<br/>
many we numbered; some said five hundred, others one<br/>
thousand.</p>

<p>Many were astonished as we passed through their towns.<br/>
One lady ran to her door, pushed her spectacles to the top of<br/>
her head, raised her hands, and exclaimed; ""What under<br/>
heavens has broken loose?"" She stood in that position the<br/>
last I saw of her.</p>

<p>The published history of [[Zion|Zion's Camp]] gives an account of<br/>
the bones of a man which we dug out of a mound. His name<br/>
was [[Zelph (BofM)|Zelph]]. The Lord showed the Prophet the history of the<br/>
man in a vision. The arrow, by which he was killed, was<br/>
found among his bones. One of his thigh bones was broken<br/>
by a stone slung in battle. The bone was put into my wagon,<br/>
and I carried it to [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], Missouri, and buried it in the<br/>
earth.</p>

<p>The Lord delivered Israel in the days of [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] by divid-<br/>
ing the [[Red Sea|Red Sea]], so they went over dry shod. When their<br/>
enemies tried to do the same, the water closed upon them and<br/>
they were drowned. The Lord delivered Zion's Camp from<br/>
their enemies on the <time datetime=""",06/19/1834

waters in [[Fishing River, Clay County, Missouri|Fishing River]] forty feet in one night, so our ene-<br/>
mies could not cross. He also sent a great hail-storm which<br/>
broke them up and sent them seeking for shelter.</p>

<p>The camp of Zion arrived at Brother [[John Matthias Burk|Burk's]], in Clay County,<br/>
Missouri, on the <time datetime=""",06/24/1834
671.0,18,,""">24th of June, 1834</time>, and we pitched our tents<br/>
on the premises. He told some of the brethren of my com-<br/>
pany that he had a spare room that some of us might occupy<br/>

fearing some other company would get it first, left all other</p>",

<p>business and went to work, cleaning out the room, and imme-<br/>
diately spread down our blankets, so as to hold a right to the<br/>
room. It was but a short time afterwards that our brethren,<br/>
who were attacked by [[cholera|cholera]], were brought in and laid upon<br/>
our beds. None of us ever used those blankets again, for they<br/>
were buried with the dead. So we gained nothing but expe-<br/>
rience by being selfish, and we lost our bedding.</p>

<p>I will exhort all my young friends to not cherish selfishness;<br/>
but if you have any, get rid of it as soon as possible. Be<br/>
generous and noble-hearted, kind to your parents, brothers,<br/>
sisters and play-mates. Never contend with them; but try to<br/>
make peace whenever you can. Whenever you are blessed<br/>
with any good thing, be willing to share it with others. By<br/>
Cultivating these principles while you are young, you will lay<br/>
a foundation to do much good through your lives, and you<br/>
will be beloved and respected of the Lord and all good men.</p>

in history, the Prophet called the Camp together, and organ<br/>
ized the Church in Zion, and gave much good counsel to all.</p>

<p>He advised all the young men, who had no families, to stay<br/>
in Missouri and not return to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. Not having any family,<br/>
I stopped with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], as did [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and </p>",

<p>[[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]]. We spent the summer together, laboring<br/>
hard, cutting wheat, quarrying rock, making brick, or anything<br/>
else we could find to do.</p>

<p>In the fall I had a desire to go and preach the gospel. I<br/>
knew the gospel which the Lord had revealed to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]<br/>
was true, and of such great value that I wanted to tell it to<br/>
the people who had not heard it. It was so good and plain,<br/>
it seemed to me I could make the people believe it.</p>

<p>I was but a [[Teacher|Teacher]], and it is not a Teacher's office to go<br/>
abroad and preach. I dared not tell any of the authorities of<br/>
the Church that I wanted to preach, lest they might think I<br/>
was seeking for an office.</p>

<p>I went into the woods where no one could see me, and I<br/>
prayed to the Lord to open my way so that I could go and<br/>
preach the gospel. While I was praying, the Spirit of the<br/>
Lord came upon me, and told me my prayer was heard and<br/>
that my request should be granted.</p>

<p>I felt very happy, and got up and walked out of the woods<br/>
into the traveled road, and there I met a [[High Priest|High Priest]] who<br/>
had lived in the same house with me some six months.</p>

<p>He had not said a word to me about preaching the gospel;<br/>
but now, as soon as I met him, he said, ""the Lord has revealed<br/>
to me that it is your privilege to be ordained, and to go and<br/>
preach the gospel.”</p>

<p>I told him I was willing to do whatever the Lord required<br/>
of me. I did not tell him I had just asked the Lord to let<br/>
me go and preach.</p>

<p>In a few days a council was called at [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight's]], and I<br/>
was ordained a [[Priest|Priest]] and sent on a mission into [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] and<br/>
[[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in company with an [[Henry Brown|Elder]]. This mission was given<br/>
us by Elder [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]], who was the first [[Bishop|Bishop]]<br/>
ordained in the Church.</p>

<p>The law of God to us in those days was to go without purse<br/>
or scrip. Our journey lay through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], from<br/>
which the Saints had just been driven, and it was dangerous<br/>
for a ""Mormon"" to be found in that part of the [[Missouri|State]].</p>

<p>We put some [[Book of Mormon|Books of Mormon]] and some clothing into our<br/>
valises, strapped them on our backs, and started on foot. We<br/>
Crossed the ferry into Jackson County, and went through it.</p>",

<p>HISTORY <br/>
OF <br/>
WILFORD WOODRUFF.<br/>
(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)</p>

<br/>
<p>IN tracing the history of my fathers, I find <br/>
it difficult to obtain a satisfactory account of<br/>
the Woodruff family for more than three gen-<br/>
erations.</p>

<br/>
<p>My great grandfather, [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Woodruff]],<br/>
lived nearly one hundred years, and possessed <br/>
an iron constitution and performed a great<br/>
amount of manual labor nearly up to the time<br/>
of his death. His wife's name was [[Sarah Woodford Woodruff|Sarah]]; she <br/>
bore to him nine children as follows:—[[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1743|Josiah]], <br/>
[[Appleton Woodruff|Appleton]], [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad]], [[Elisha Woodruff|Elisha]], [[Joseph Woodruff, b. 1752|Joseph]], [[Obedience Woodruff Fuller|Rhoda]],<br/>
[[Phebe Woodruff, b. 1758|Phebe]], and two names not given.</p>

<br/>
<p>My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was the <br/>
third son of Josiah. He was born in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farming-<br/>
ton]], Hartford Co., Connecticut, in 1751; he <br/>
also possessed a strong constitution; it was <br/>
said that he performed the most labor for <br/>
several years of any man in Hartford Co., and<br/>
from over exertion in hewing timber he was <br/>
attacked with rheumatism in his right hip, <br/>
which caused severe lameness for several <br/>
years before his death. He married [[Dinah Woodford Woodruff|Dinah <br/>

<br/>
<p>My father was a strong constitutioned man, <br/>
and has done a great amount of labor. At <br/>
eighteen years of age, he commenced attending<br/>
a flouring and saw mill, and continued about</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
50 years; most of this time he labored eight-<br/>
een hours a day.</p>

<br/>
<p>He never made any profession of religion,<br/>
until I baptized him with all his household<br/>
into the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day <br/>
Saints]] on the <time datetime=""",07/01/1838
3.0,1,1807-03-01,""">first day of July, 1838</time>. He was<br/>
a man of great charity, honesty, integrity and<br/>
truth, and made himself poor by giving to the <br/>
poor, and accommodating his fellow men by <br/>
loaning money and becoming surety for his <br/>
neighbors, and always saying yes, to every <br/>
man who asked a favor at his hand.</p>

<br/>
<p>I was born in the north part of the town of <br/>
Farmington, now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], Hartford Co., <br/>
Conn., <time datetime=""",03/01/1807
3.0,1,1833-12-29,""">March 1, 1807</time>. I assisted my father <br/>
in attending the Farmington Mills, until I was <br/>
twenty years of age.</p>

<br/>
<p>In April, 1827, I took the flouring mill of my <br/>
aunt, [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen Wheeler]], which I attended three<br/>
years. In May, 1830, I took charge of the <br/>
flouring mill of Mr. [[Samuel Collins|Collins]], the ax manufac-<br/>
turer, in [[South Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|South Canton]], Conn. At the end of <br/>
one year it was demolished to make way for <br/>
other machinery. In March, 1831, I took <br/>
charge of the flouring mill owned by Mr. [[Richard B. Cowles|Rich-<br/>
ard B. Cowles]] of [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]], Conn. In <br/>
the spring of 1832, in company with my oldest <br/>
brother, Azmon, I went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego<br/>
Co., New York, and purchased a farm and <br/>
saw mill, and settled in business.</p>

<br/>
<p>At an early age my mind was exercised upon<br/>
religious subjects, although I never made a <br/>
profession until 1830. I did not then join any<br/>
church, for the reason that I could not find any <br/>
denomination whose doctrines, faith or prac-<br/>
tice, agreed with the [[gospel of Jesus Christ|gospel of Jesus Christ]],<br/>
or the ordinances and gifts which the apostles <br/>
taught. Although the ministers of the day <br/>
taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles <br/>
and ordinances, which the ancient saints en-<br/>
joyed, were done away and no longer needed,<br/>
I did not believe it to be true, only as they<br/>
were done away through the unbelief of the <br/>
children of men. I believed the same gifts, <br/>
graces, miracles and power would be manifest<br/>
in one age of the world as in another, when <br/>
God had a church upon the earth, and that <br/>
the church of God would be re-established <br/>
upon the earth, and that I should live to <br/>
see it. These principles were rivetted <br/>
upon my mind from the perusal of the [[Old Testament|Old]] <br/>
and [[New Testament|New Testament]], with fervent prayer<br/>
that the Lord would show me what was right <br/>
and wrong, and lead me in the path of salva-<br/>
tion, without any regard to the opinions of <br/>
man, and the whisperings of the Spirit of the <br/>
Lord for the space of three years, taught me <br/>
that he was about to set up his church and <br/>
kingdom upon the earth in the last days. I <br/>
was taught these things from my youth by <br/>
[[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], an aged man, who lived in<br/>
[[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]], Conn., who was frequently called<br/>
the old prophet Mason: he taught me many <br/>
things which are now coming to pass. He did <br/>
not believe that any man had authority to ad-<br/>
minister in the ordinances of the gospel, but <br/>
believed it was our privilege through faith,<br/>
prayer and fasting, to heal the sick, and cast <br/>
out devils by the [[laying on of hands|laying on of hands]], which <br/>
was the case under his administration, as <br/>
many could testify.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1832, I was inspired to go to [[Rhode Island|Rhode Is-<br/>
land]]; my brother, Asahel, was also directed<br/>
by the [[spirit of God|Spirit of God]] to go to the same place. <br/>
When we met, we both told our impressions,<br/>
and it caused us to marvel and wonder, what <br/>
the Lord wanted of us in [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]; but as <br/>
we had made preparations to move to the <br/>
west, we let outward circumstances control us, <br/>
and [[Jonah (OT)|Jonah]]-like, instead of going to Rhode Is-<br/>
land, we went to Richland, Oswego Co., New <br/>
York, and there remained until <time datetime=""",12/29/1833
3.0,1,1833-12-31,""">Dec. 29, 1833</time>, <br/>
when I heard Elders [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] and <br/>
[[Elijah Cheney|Elijah Cheeny]] preach. My brother Azmon <br/>
and I believed their testimony, entertained the <br/>
elders and offered ourselves for baptism the<br/>
first sermon we heard. We read the [[Book of Mormon|Book of <br/>
Mormon]], and I received a testimony that it <br/>
was true.</p>

<br/>
<p>We soon learned what the Lord wanted of<br/>
us in Rhode Island, for at the time we were <br/>
warned to go there, two of the elders were</p>

<br/>
<p>In February following, in company with<br/>
Elder Holton, I walked some 60 miles to the <br/>
town of [[Fabius, Onondaga County, New York|Fabius]], to attend an evening meeting <br/>
of the Saints in that place, where Elder Pulsi-<br/>
pher was presiding; I saw the [[Book of Commandments|book of com-<br/>
mandments]] or revelations given through [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph<br/>
Smith, Jr.]], and I believed them with all my heart<br/>
and rejoiced therein; and after spending sev-<br/>

returned home rejoicing.</p>

Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland and <br/>
heard many of the Elders speak, and I felt to <br/>

brethren had taken sick, and some had died, <br/>
Joseph requested the [[Zion|camp]] to disperse, except <br/>
enough to take care of the sick; all who had <br/>
teams were required to leave the ground and <br/>
go among the brethren. I went to br. [[Lyman Wight|Ly-<br/>

mandments and obey His counsel, the plague<br/>
should be stayed from that hour, and there<br/>
should not be another case of cholera in the <br/>

<br/>
<p>Prest. Joseph Smith returned to Kirtland<br/>

<br/>
<p>I had a great desire to [[preach the gospel|preach the gospel]], <br/>

open my way to go and preach the gospel to <br/>
the inhabitants of the earth; the [[spirit of the Lord|spirit of the <br/>

and should be answered. I arose from my <br/>
knees happy, and walked some forty rods and <br/>
met [[Elias Higbee|Elias Higbee]], a [[High Priest|High Priest]], with whom <br/>
I had staid a number of months. As I ap-<br/>

<p>[Column 4]<br/>
could find any body who had faith enough to <br/>
go with me, for it would be a dangerous coun-<br/>

as ready to go South as any where; and asked <br/>
if I should go through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson county]], as it <br/>
lay in our route. He replied, it would be at <br/>
the risk of life, and he had not faith enough <br/>
to undertake it; if I had, I might try it. I also <br/>
asked him, if I went through Jackson county, <br/>
if I should start without purse or scrip accord-<br/>
ing to the law of God. He answered, that he <br/>
had not got faith enough to start on a mission<br/>
through Jackson county without money, and <br/>
if I did it, I must do it on my own faith. I <br/>
felt strenuous to keep the commandments, so <br/>
I started without money. I called upon Elder <br/>

me; he consented, and Bishop Partridge ap-<br/>
pointed him to go with me.</p>

We bowed our knees, and prayed that God<br/>
might protect us from the mob while going <br/>
through the country, and that His judgments <br/>
might rest upon the wicked who had shed the<br/>
blood of the Saints in that land, that the land <br/>
might be cleansed from sin. I had a petition <br/>

wrongs perpetrated upon us in Jackson county, <br/>

bent our way south, through Jackson county, <br/>

thing to eat, nor lodge us, because we were<br/>
Mormons. It was fifteen miles to the nearest <br/>
house, which was [[Michel Geraud|Jerrew]]'s Indian trading <br/>
house. We asked the minister to direct us <br/>
there. He gave us directions, but the Spirit <br/>
said to me he was deceiving us. I asked him <br/>
three times, and he declared he was telling us <br/>
the truth. We followed his directions and we<br/>
came to the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage river]] swamp, where we <br/>
were lost in darkness of the night. We <br/>
followed the river, but as it is very crooked, <br/>
we made but little progress. After traveling <br/>
through mud and water for one hour, we con-<br/>
cluded to go out on the open prairie and lie <br/>
down in the grass until morning, but when we <br/>
got out into the prairie we heard the [[Osage People|Osage In-<br/>
dians]]' drum and shout at the trading house<br/>
as they were having a pow-wow. As we ap-<br/>
proached, we were met by a dozen large savage<br/>
looking dogs; they smelt us in a friendly man-<br/>
ner, but did not attempt to bite nor bark. We <br/>
arrived about midnight, covered with mud, <br/>
hungry and weary, and were kindly received <br/>
and entertained for the remainder of the night <br/>

a wife; she prepared us a good supper, but <br/>
marvelled that we did not drink coffee. She <br/>
proffered us their best bed, which was highly<br/>
ornamented, but we declined her kind offer, as <br/>
we were wet and muddy; she made us a good <br/>
bed of mackinaw blankets before a large fire, <br/>

tree, and in two days dug out a canoe four feet <br/>
wide and twelve long, put on a pair of oars<br/>
and then rowed down the [[Arkansas River, United States|Arkansas river]], 125<br/>
miles to [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little Rock]], begging our food by the<br/>
way, a meal at a time, as we had opportunity. <br/>
After visiting Little Rock we traveled down <br/>
the river ten miles, and tied up our canoe on <br/>
the east bank and stopped with Mr. Jones. I <br/>
preached next day at his house. On the 16th <br/>
we left our canoe with Mr. Jones and walked<br/>
back up the river ten miles, opposite Little <br/>
Rock, and took the old military road, and <br/>
started to wade the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]] swamp, which <br/>
was mostly covered with water from Little <br/>
Rock, Arkansas, to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee, a <br/>
distance of about 175 miles. We waded through <br/>
mud and water knee deep, day after day, and<br/>
in some instances forty miles per day, before <br/>
we could get a stopping place.</p>

<br/>
<p>On the <time datetime=""",03/24/1835
3.0,2,1835-03-27,""">24th</time>, while in the swamps, I had an <br/>
attack of the rheumatism and could not travel <br/>
fast. My companion, br. [[Henry Brown|Brown]], had got in a <br/>
hurry, and wished to return to his family in <br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and as I could not travel as fast as <br/>
he wished, we parted. He left me sitting on a <br/>
log in the mud and water; I was lame and un-<br/>
able to walk, without food, and twelve miles <br/>
from the nearest house on the road; he went <br/>
out of sight in great haste. I then knelt down <br/>
in the water and prayed to the Lord to heal <br/>
me. The [[Spirit of the Lord|Spirit of the Lord]] rested upon me, <br/>
and I was healed; the pain left me; I arose and <br/>
went my way. Whenever I met with one or <br/>
more families, I preached and bore testimony<br/>
to them.</p>

<br/>
<p>I crossed the Mississippi river in the even-<br/>
ing of the <time datetime=""",03/27/1835

lic house kept by Mr. [[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]]. I was <br/>
suspected of being an impostor. Mr. Jackson <br/>
believed I was one of [[John Andrews Murrell|Murrill]]'s clan, who were <br/>
then murdering and stealing negroes, and to <br/>
test me, he gathered together a large house <br/>
full of the most wicked and corrupt people in <br/>
the city, and set me to preaching, to see <br/>
whether I could preach or not.</p>

<br/>
<p>I do not think that Mr. Jackson or the same <br/>
company of men and women will ever meet<br/>

would not like again to have their sins and <br/>

came to a creek which had swollen to such an<br/>
extent by the rain that we could not cross <br/>
without swimming our horses; several of the <br/>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
the stream, to ford it, but in the attempt, in <br/>
the midst of the darkness and the raging of <br/>
the wind and rain, we were lost in the thick <br/>
woods, amidst the rain, wind, creeks and fal-<br/>
len tree tops; we crossed streams nearly twen-<br/>
ty times. I was reminded of [[Paul (NT)|Paul]]'s perils by <br/>
water; but the Lord was merciful unto us in <br/>
the midst of our troubles, for while we were <br/>
groping in the dark, running the risk of killing <br/>
both ourselves and animals by riding off pre-<br/>
cipitous bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone <br/>
round about us, and revealed our perilous situ-<br/>

The light continued with us until we found a <br/>

light disappeared, and we were enabled to <br/>
reach the house of br. [[Henry Thomas Jr.|Henry Thomas]] at nine <br/>

the Lord for our preservation.</p>

joined us in our labors, accompanied by his <br/>

to me the blessings he had received in Kirtland <br/>

Wilford Woodruff, sworn out by [[Matthew Williams|Matthew <br/>

the sheriff, [[Robert C. Petty|Robert C Petty]]. Elders Patten <br/>

about fifty, under pretence of law, led by the<br/>
sheriff, a colonel, first and second major, with <br/>
other officers, and a Methodist priest with a <br/>
gun upon his shoulder. I was in another coun-<br/>

of prophesying falsely, by saying that four <br/>
persons who were baptized should receive the <br/>
[[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] in twenty-four hours, and that <br/>
Christ should come the [[Second Coming of Jesus Christ|second]] time before this <br/>

house, on [[Thompson Creek, Weakley County, Tennessee|Thompson's creek]], to preach; the<br/>
house was crowded. As I rose to speak, a <br/>
Baptist priest, Mr. Browning, arrived at the <br/>
door on horseback, and stepped in greatly agi-<br/>
tated, and told the deacon to forbid my preach-<br/>
ing in the house; at the same time commenced <br/>
a tirade of abuse against the Mormons, telling<br/>
several lies, which I corrected before the peo-<br/>
ple, which increased his rage. As I was for-<br/>
bidden to preach in the house, and had been <br/>
invited, and traveled many miles to fulfil my<br/>
appointment, I told the people I would like to <br/>
preach and was willing to stand on a wood<br/>
pile, a fence, a cart, or any place they would<br/>
appoint. A man rose and said he owned the <br/>
land in front of the meeting house, and I might</p>

<p>[Column 3]<br/>
stand and preach on that, and welcome. All <br/>
the congregation, with the exception of the <br/>
minister and one deacon, arose and left the <br/>
house, walked across the street and formed <br/>
seats of a worm fence, and gave good attention <br/>
while I preached for an hour and a half on the<br/>
principles of the gospel.</p>

<br/>
<p>When I closed, Mr. [[Randolph Alexander|Randolph Alexander]], <br/>
who had never heard a Mormon Elder speak <br/>
before, said, the people of the present day <br/>
made him think of a pen of hogs; the keeper<br/>
would make a trough, and pour into it hot or<br/>
cold water, dish water or anything else, and<br/>
they would drink it; but let a stranger come <br/>
along and pour over a basket of corn on the <br/>
back side of the pen, and the hogs would be<br/>
frightened and run and snort all over the pen. <br/>
He said it was so with the people; the priests<br/>
would feed them with any kind of doctrine,<br/>
no matter how false, the people will swallow <br/>
it down, but let a stranger come and preach<br/>
the gospel of Jesus Christ, which will save<br/>
the people, as Mr. Woodruff has done, and the<br/>
people are afraid of him.</p>

<br/>
<p>Mr. Alexander invited me home, bought a <br/>
[[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], and was soon baptized, and <br/>
several others followed his example.</p>

set, without means to prosecute our journey <br/>
further. We retired to a high hill, and bowed<br/>
before the Lord, and prayed that he would <br/>
open our way; the Spirit of the Lord rested <br/>
upon us, and testified unto us that our prayers <br/>
would be answered. As we arose from our <br/>
knees, a sloop came into the harbor; we went <br/>
to the captain, and enquired where he was <br/>
going; he replied, through the channel of <br/>
[[Vinalhaven, Waldo County, Maine|Vinal Haven]]; he took us on board and landed <br/>
us on [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Fox Islands]], at 2 a.m. on the <br/>

hour, rambling over rocks and bushes, found the<br/>
house of Mr. [[Nathaniel Dyer|Nathaniel Dyer]], and were enter-<br/>
tained. It being Sunday morning, Mr. [[Benjamin Kent|Benj.<br/>
Kent]] piloted us to the [[Baptist|Baptist]] meeting-house,<br/>
occupied by Elder [[Gideon J. Newton|Gideon J. Newton]], pastor <br/>
of the only religious denomination upon the<br/>
island. At the door, I sent for the deacon,<br/>
and told him I wished him to inform the min-<br/>
ister that we were servants of God, and wish-<br/>
ed to deliver a message to that people. The<br/>
minister sent word for us to come into the pul-<br/>
pit; accordingly, with valize in hand, we walk-<br/>
ed up into the pulpit, and took a seat on each <br/>
side of him. When he closed his discourse, <br/>
he asked me what hour we would like to <br/>
speak; I told him at five; he gave out our ap-<br/>
pointment, and invited us to his house. I <br/>
asked him how many school houses were on <br/>
the island; he said four, and gave me their<br/>
names. I asked him if they were free for any<br/>
one to preach in; he answered in the affirma-<br/>
tive. I took out my Bible, [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], <br/>
and [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and Covenants]], and laid them all <br/>
upon his stand; he promised to read them.<br/>
The hour of meeting arrived, and I preached<br/>
to a full house upon the first principles of the <br/>
gospel, and bore testimony that the Lord had <br/>
raised up a prophet, and had commenced to <br/>
establish his church and kingdom again upon<br/>
the earth, in fulfillment of his word, as spoken <br/>
through the ancient prophets and apostles. <br/>
This was the first discourse ever delivered by <br/>
any Latter-day Saint upon this chain of is-<br/>
lands; Elder Hale bore testimony. I gave out <br/>
appointments for preaching in the four school<br/>
houses. The people came out en masse to in-<br/>
vestigate the principles which we taught. In <br/>
fourteen days we preached nineteen discourses. <br/>
Capt. [[Justus Ames|Justice Ames]] and [[Betsey Hudson Ames|wife]] were baptized <br/>
by Elder Hale. Elder Newton, the Baptist<br/>
minister, with his family, attended twelve of <br/>
our meetings, read the books, and was con-<br/>
vinced by the Spirit of the Lord that our doc-<br/>
trine was true, and he had a hard struggle in</p>

<p>[Column 3]<br/>
his mind to know which to do, receive it or re-<br/>
ject it; he finally resolved to reject it, and <br/>
commenced preaching against us. He sent for <br/>
Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]], Methodist minister, on the <br/>
South Island, to come and help him; he had<br/>
been long at variance with Mr. Douglass, but <br/>
they became very friendly and united in a war <br/>
against us. We continued preaching daily<br/>
until we baptized most of the members of Mr. <br/>
Newton's church, and those who owned the<br/>
meeting house.</p>

<br/>
<p>I followed Mr. Douglas to his own island, <br/>
and commenced preaching to his church, and<br/>
baptized a good share of his members, among <br/>
whom were several sea captains. Ministers <br/>
from the main land were sent for, who came<br/>
over and tried to put a stop to the work by<br/>
preaching and lying about us; but the work <br/>
continued to roll on. They wished me to work<br/>
a miracle to convince them that my doctrine<br/>
was true. I told them they had rejected the <br/>
truth, and they would see signs, but not unto <br/>
salvation.</p>

<br/>
<p>Vinal Haven, which includes both north and <br/>
[[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|south Fox Island]], is in lat. 44°, long. 69° 10'. <br/>
The inhabitants are generally healthy and in-<br/>
dustrious, and hospitable to strangers. The peo-<br/>
ple obtain most of their wealth by fishing, and<br/>
fit out annually over one hundred licensed ves-<br/>
sels, beside many smaller crafts. The north <br/>
island is nine miles long and two wide; popu-<br/>
lation 800, and contains a post office, a store, a<br/>
grist mill, four school houses, and a Baptist <br/>
church. The land is rocky and rough, yet<br/>
there are farms which produce good wheat,<br/>
barley, oats, potatoes and grass; the principal <br/>
timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and birch. The <br/>
rasp and gooseberry grow in great abundance. <br/>
Sheep are the principal stock.</p>

<br/>
<p>South Fox island is about ten miles long and <br/>
five wide, and is a mass of rocks, principally <br/>
granite, formed into shelves, hills, hollows,<br/>
and cut up into nooks, points and ravines by<br/>
coves and harbors; population, 1000. There<br/>
are some small patches under cultivation, at <br/>
the expense of great labor and toil. Many <br/>
resident fishermen fish at [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and <br/>
bring them home, and dry them upon flakes; <br/>
they annually supply the market with a great <br/>
amount of cod fish, mackerel and boxed her-<br/>
ring. The latter island contains two stores, <br/>
three tide saw mills, six school houses, a small<br/>
branch of the Methodist church and a priest.<br/>
The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and<br/>
birch, also gooseberries, raspberries, whortle-<br/>
berries and upland cranberries; bushes and <br/>
timber grow out of the crevices of the rocks.</p>

<br/>
<p>There is a great amount and variety of fish<br/>
in the waters around these islands, viz.: whale, <br/>
black fish, shark, ground shark, pilot fish,<br/>
horse mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, halibut,<br/>
cod, pollock, tom cod, hake, haddock, macker-<br/>
el, shad, bass, alewives, herring, pohagen,<br/>
dolphin, whiting, frost fish, flounders, smelt, <br/>
skate, shrimp, shad, cusk, bluebacks, scollop, <br/>

had never heard a sermon preached by a Latter-<br/>
day Saint. Joseph said he could not go, but <br/>
he would send a man. After hesitating a mo-<br/>
ment, he turned to me and said, ""You go with <br/>
this man and heal his children""—at the same <br/>
time giving me a red silk handkerchief, and <br/>
said, ""After you lay hands upon them, wipe<br/>
their faces with it, and they shall be healed;<br/>
and as long as you will keep that handkerchief<br/>
it shall ever remain as a league between you <br/>
and me."" I went and did as I was command-<br/>
ed, and the children were healed.</p>

<br/>
<p>On the <time datetime=""",07/25/1839
3.0,4,1839-08-08,""">25th</time>, I was attacked with chills and<br/>
fever. I had a chill every other day and was <br/>
very sick.</p>

<br/>
<p><time datetime=""",08/08/1839
3.0,4,1839-08-21,""">Aug. 8</time>—I laid my hands upon my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and<br/>
children, blessed them, committed them into <br/>
the hands of God, and started upon my Eng-<br/>
lish mission, leaving my family sick, and with <br/>
not more than four days' provisions. Br. Brig-<br/>
ham Young rowed me across the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]] <br/>
in a boat; I was sick and feeble. When I <br/>
landed I laid down upon the bank of the river <br/>
on a side of sole leather. The Prophet Joseph<br/>
came along and looked at me and said, ""You <br/>
are starting on your mission."" I said yes, but <br/>
I look like a poor instrument for a missionary;<br/>
I look more fit for a hospital or dissecting room<br/>
than a mission. He replied, ""What do you <br/>
say that for? Go ahead in the name of the<br/>
Lord, and you shall be healed and blessed on <br/>
your mission."" I thanked him. A brother <br/>
came along with a wagon and carried me a <br/>
few miles on my road. I started without purse <br/>
or scrip, and passed by [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]], who<br/>
was hewing logs for a house; he was bare-<br/>
footed, bare-headed, without coat or vest on. <br/>
He said, ""I have no money, but I have an <br/>
empty purse; I will give you that."" I went a <br/>
few rods and found Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] build-<br/>
ing a log cabin; he said, ""I have one dollar; I <br/>
will give you that to put in your purse."" He <br/>
blessed me and I went my way, accompanied<br/>
by Elder John Taylor. I had a shake of the <br/>
ague every other day and lay on the bottom of <br/>
the wagon while I traveled.</p>

<br/>
<p>We staid with [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel H.]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos <br/>
Smith]] at [[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]], and held a meeting with<br/>
the Saints, who contributed $9 to our neces-<br/>
sities, and [[George Miller|George Miller]] gave us a horse. <br/>
Father [[Zebedee Coltrin|Coltrin]] was going east; he took us into <br/>
his wagon to help up us along. We spent five<br/>
days in Springfield, where Elder Taylor print-<br/>
ed fifteen hundred copies of a pamphlet upon<br/>
the Missouri persecution. We sold our horse, <br/>
and left on the <time datetime=""",08/21/1839
3.0,4,1839-08-24,""">21st</time> and continued our journey. <br/>
We spent the night of the <time datetime=""",08/24/1839
3.0,4,1839-08-28,""">24th</time> with Dr. [[Charles Burns Modesitt|Modi-<br/>
sett]], of [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terrehaute]].</p>

<br/>
<p>On the <time datetime=""",08/28/1839
3.0,4,1839-09-02,""">28th</time>, while traveling, Elder Taylor<br/>
fell to the ground as though he had been<br/>
knocked down. We administered to him, and <br/>
he revived. On the following day he fell again, <br/>
and fainted several times; it seemed as though<br/>
the [[Destroyer|destroyer]] would take his life; we traveled <br/>
with him four days after he was taken sick. <br/>
His sickness proved to be [[bilious fever|bilious fever]]. We<br/>
stopped with him two days, at a German <br/>
tavern, in [[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]], Wayne county, In-<br/>
diana, with a kind family, with whom he was <br/>
acquainted. Father Coltrin would stay no <br/>
longer; I proposed to remain with br. Taylor, <br/>
but as I was sick with fever and ague, and not<br/>
able to take care of myself, br. Taylor advised <br/>
me to continue my journey with Father Coltrin, <br/>
saying, ""it is easier to take care of one sick <br/>
man than two."" I committed him into the <br/>
hands of God; and the family promised to do</p>

<p>[Column 3]<br/>
all in their power to make him comfortable. <br/>
I parted from him with a heavy heart.</p>

<br/>
<p><time datetime=""",09/02/1839

I traveled to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]] on a canal boat; had the<br/>
ague daily, was very sick; had no companion<br/>
except sectarian priests, who were daily lying <br/>
about the Mormons. I took stage at Albany<br/>

mother, [[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|Anna Thompson]], died, aged 84; I was <br/>
too sick to attend her funeral. It is a singular <br/>
incident that my grandfather, [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot Thompson]],<br/>
and Anna Thompson, his wife, [[Samuel Thompson, b. 1709|Samuel Thomp-<br/>

fifteen days, attended with a severe cough, <br/>
and the hour appointed for the funeral was the<br/>
time for my ague, yet I attended the funeral<br/>

quested me to keep until I arrived in Liverpool, <br/>
saying, I would there need it. This I found to<br/>
be true after landing; that money was all we <br/>
had to pay our expenses to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], and we<br/>

[[William Clayton|Wm. Clayton]], who presided over that branch, <br/>
numbering 164 members. I was immediately <br/>
called upon to visit a woman possessed with <br/>
the [[Devil|devil]]; she was raging and foaming and had<br/>
to be held by four men. The more we rebuked<br/>
the devil the worse she raged. We continued<br/>
to pray and administer until we cast the devil<br/>
out. She arose and gave thanks to the Lord. <br/>
The devil then entered into a young child, and<br/>
we cast him out. I preached several times, <br/>
and laid hands on twenty-eight persons. I <br/>
went to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] on the <time datetime=""",01/21/1840

large assembly in [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], the Lord revealed <br/>
unto me that it would be the last meeting that<br/>
I would hold with the Saints in the Potteries <br/>
for many days; I told the people it was the <br/>
last meeting I should hold with them for a <br/>
season; it created much excitement. I had <br/>
appointments out for a week, which I got bro.<br/>
Cordon to fill. I went before the Lord in pray-<br/>

Spirit said, ""Go to the south."" According to <br/>
the directions of the Spirit, on the <time datetime=""",03/03/1840

for the gospel. I preached twice at his house. <br/>

<p>[Column 4]<br/>
John Benbow and [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]]. I here found a society <br/>
called ""[[United Brethren|United Brethren]],"" numbering about <br/>
six hundred members, and about fifty preach-<br/>
ers; [[Thomas Kington|Thos. Kington]] was the presiding elder. <br/>
They came from all quarters to hear me preach,<br/>
and believed my testimony; and I preached <br/>
and baptized daily. The ministers of the<br/>
Church of England sent three church clerks to<br/>
see what I was doing, and I baptized them. <br/>
One constable came to arrest me for preaching, <br/>
and I baptized him. In about thirty days I<br/>
baptized 160, forty eight of whom were preach-<br/>
ers of the United Brethren, including their <br/>
presiding elder, Thomas Kington.</p>

<br/>
<p>I established forty two preaching places,<br/>
licensed according to law.</p>

<br/>
<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/09/1840
3.0,4,1840-04-22,""">9th April</time>, I had an apointment at <br/>
[[Hawcross, Redmarley D|Haw Cross]]. As I was going into the meeting, <br/>
letters were put into my hands from Elder<br/>
Brigham Young and others, informing me of <br/>
his arrival with five of the Twelve, and re-<br/>
questing me to come to Preston, and attend a<br/>
general conference. A vast assembly had<br/>
gathered to attend my meeting; the house, yard,<br/>
and street were crowded; a mob had also <br/>
gathered. I preached to the people; five came<br/>
forward to be baptized. The mob surrounded <br/>
the pool, armed with stones. I dismissed the <br/>
meeting, and went away; but the congrega-<br/>
tion and mob remained on the ground till mid-<br/>
night; and as there was no prospect of their <br/>
dispersing, and the candidates were anxious to<br/>
be baptized, I went down into the water and <br/>
baptized five in the midst of a shower of<br/>
stones. The water was all in a foam for a <br/>
rod around me. None that I baptized were <br/>
hit, and I was only hit twice, once on my hip <br/>
and once on my head; the blow on my head <br/>
raised a large bump, which went away while <br/>
I was confirming: subsequently I baptized<br/>
many of the mob.</p>

<br/>
<p>I left next morning for Preston, and attended<br/>
the conference with the Twelve, and returned<br/>
to Herefordshire, accompanied by Elder Brig-<br/>
ham Young, on the <time datetime=""",04/22/1840
3.0,4,1840-08-18,""">22nd April</time>, and was soon<br/>
joined by Elder Willard Richards. Elder <br/>
Young remained twenty seven days, preaching, <br/>
baptizing, confirming and counseling. Num-<br/>
bers were added daily to the church: he then<br/>
returned to Manchester.</p>

<br/>
<p>I spent about seven months in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], <br/>
[[Gloucestershire, England|Gloucestershire]] and [[Worcestershire, England|Worcestershire]]. We<br/>
baptized over eighteen hundred, including all<br/>
of the United Brethren save one. We bap-<br/>
tized over two hundred preachers of various <br/>
denominations in that part of the vineyard. <br/>
A synod of church ministers became so alarm-<br/>
ed for their flocks in that part of the vineyard, <br/>
they petitioned Parliament to adopt measures<br/>
to stop our preaching. They received for an<br/>
answer, that if they were as well acquainted<br/>
with the Bible as their hunting grounds, and <br/>
were as much interested in the welfare of the <br/>
souls of men, as the chasing of the stags and <br/>
foxes, they would not lose so many of their <br/>
congregations.</p>

CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.<br/>
-[Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], February, 1858.]-</p>

<br/>
<p>VARIED and diverse are the lives and for-<br/>
tunes of men; while the paths of some are <br/>
strewn with flowers and ease from the cradle <br/>
to the grave, with naught to disturb their<br/>
peace; others are marked victims of varied<br/>
misfortunes, accidents and dangers. The last<br/>
named class is the one in whose ranks I have <br/>
stood, through my infancy, childhood, youth<br/>
and manhood, up to the present time, so much <br/>
so that it has seemed as though some invisible<br/>
power or fate was watching my foot steps in<br/>
order to find some opportunity to take my life<br/>
from the earth. I can only attribute the con-<br/>
tinuation of my life to the present time to a <br/>
merciful God, whose hand has been stretched<br/>
out and rescued me from death in the midst of<br/>
the many dangers and hair breadth escapes, I <br/>
have passed through; some of which I will <br/>
here mention.</p>

<br/>
<p>When three years of age, I fell into a cal-<br/>
dron of boiling water, was instantly caught <br/>
out, but was so badly scalded, that it was nine <br/>
months before I was considered out of dan-<br/>
ger.</p>

<br/>
<p>At five years of age, I fell from the great <br/>
beam of a barn, striking my face upon the <br/>
floor, which came near breaking my neck.</p>

<br/>
<p>Three months afterwards, I broke one of my<br/>
arms, by falling down stairs. I soon after<br/>
broke my other arm by falling out of a high<br/>
stoop, upon a pile of timber.</p>

<br/>
<p>When six years of age, I came near being<br/>
killed by a surly bull. My [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and I were<br/>
feeding pumpkins to the cattle; a surly bull <br/>
drove my cow away from the one she was<br/>
eating. I took the pumpkin he had left, upon<br/>
which he pitched at me. My father told me <br/>
to throw down the pumpkin and run. I ran <br/>
down a steep hill, and took the pumpkin with<br/>
me, being determined that the cow should have<br/>
her rights. The bull pursued; as he was<br/>
about to overtake me, I stepped into a post<br/>
hole and fell; the bull leaped over me, after <br/>
the pumpkin, and tore it to pieces with his <br/>
horns, and would have served me in the same <br/>
way, had I not fallen.</p>

<br/>
<p>During the same year I went into my father's<br/>
saw mill, with several others; I got upon the<br/>
head-block to take a ride while the carriage <br/>
was running back, not anticipating any dan-<br/>
ger; my leg was caught between the head-<br/>
block and the fender-post, and broke both <br/>
bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken <br/>
to the house, and lay nine hours before my<br/>
bones were set, suffering severe pain; but being<br/>
young, my bones soon knit together and I was <br/>
upon my feet again; during my confinement by <br/>
this lameness, my bro. [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] was also<br/>
confined in the same room with the typhus <br/>
fever.</p>

<br/>
<p>When seven years of age, I was riding on<br/>
the top of a load of hay, which my uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Oz-<br/>
en Woodruff]], was driving to the barn; he turn-<br/>
ed the load over upon me; I was nearly suffo-<br/>
cated for the want of air, before the hay was<br/>
removed.</p>

<br/>
<p>At eight years old, I was riding in a one<br/>
horse wagon with several others; the horse<br/>
took fright, ran down a steep hill, and turned <br/>
the wagon over upon us; but again while in <br/>
the midst of danger, my life was preserved:<br/>
none of us were seriously injured.</p>

<br/>
<p>When nine years old, I climbed into an elm<br/>
tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon a dry<br/>
limb, which broke, and I fell about fifteen feet<br/>
upon my back, which beat the breath out of <br/>
my body. A cousin ran and told my parents I<br/>
was dead; before they arrived at the spot, I<br/>
came to my senses, and met them.</p>

<br/>
<p>When twelve years of age, I was drowned<br/>
in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]], and sunk in 30 ft. of<br/>
water, and after carrying one person to the <br/>
bottom with me, I was miraculously saved <br/>
by a young man, named [[John Bacon|Bacon]], diving to the</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
bottom, and carrying with him a large stone<br/>
to hold him down until he obtained my body,<br/>
not expecting to save me alive: I suffered much <br/>
in being restored to life.</p>

<br/>
<p>At thirteen years of age, while passing <br/>
through [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] meadows, in the depth of <br/>
winter, the roads were drifted with snow; and <br/>
in an exceedingly blustering day, I became so <br/>
chilled and overcome with cold that I could <br/>
not travel. I crawled into the hollow of a <br/>
large apple tree. A man in the distance, see-<br/>
ing me go in, hastened to my rescue, realizing <br/>
my danger more fully than I did: when he ar-<br/>
rived at the spot, I had fallen asleep, and was <br/>
nearly insensible; he had much difficulty in <br/>
arousing me to a sense of my situation. He <br/>
procured means to carry me to my father's <br/>
house, and through a kind providence, my life <br/>
was again preserved.</p>

<br/>
<p>At fourteen years of age, I split my left <br/>
instep open with an ax, which went nearly <br/>
through my foot: it was nine months getting <br/>
well.</p>

<br/>
<p>At fifteen years of age, I was bitten in my <br/>
left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of <br/>
hydrophobia; he dented my hand with his <br/>
teeth, but did not draw blood, and I was again <br/>
preserved, through the mercies of God, from <br/>
an awful death.</p>

<br/>
<p>At the age of seventeen, I was riding a very <br/>
ill-tempered horse that I was not acquainted <br/>
with; and while going down a very steep <br/>
rocky hill, the horse taking advantage of the <br/>
ground, suddenly leaped from the road, and <br/>
ran down the steep, amid the rocks, at full <br/>
speed, and commenced kicking up, and at-<br/>
tempted to throw me over his head upon the <br/>
rocks; but I lodged upon the top of his head, <br/>
grasped hold of each ear as with a death grip, <br/>
expecting every moment to be dashed to pieces <br/>
against the rocks. While in this position, <br/>
sitting astride of his neck, with no bridle to <br/>
guide him but his ears, he plunged down the <br/>
hill under full speed, until he ran against a <br/>
rock and was dashed to the ground. I went <br/>
over both his head and the rock, about one rod, <br/>
and struck the ground square on my feet, being <br/>
the only thing visible that saved my life; for<br/>
had I struck upon any other part of my body, <br/>
it must have killed me instantly; as it was, my <br/>
bones crushed from under me, as though they <br/>
were reeds. It broke my left leg in two places, <br/>
and put out both my ankles in a shocking <br/>
manner, and the horse came near rolling over <br/>
me in his struggles to get up. My uncle, <br/>
[[Titus Woodruff|Titus Woodruff]], saw me fall, got assistance<br/>
and carried me to his house. I lay from 2 p.m. <br/>
till 10, without medical aid; then my father <br/>
arrived, bringing [[Dr. Swift|Dr. Swift]], of Farmington, with <br/>
him, who set my bones, boxed up my limbs, <br/>
and carried me in his carriage eight miles <br/>
that night, to my father's. My sufferings <br/>
were very great; I had good attention, how-<br/>
ever, and in eight weeks I was out doors upon <br/>
my crutches.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1827, while attempting to clear the ice <br/>
out of a water-wheel, standing upon the wheel <br/>
with one arm around the shaft, a man hoisted <br/>
the gate, and let a full head of water upon it; <br/>
as soon as the water struck the wheel, it <br/>
started; my feet slipped into the wheel, but I <br/>
immediately plunged head foremost over the <br/>
rim into about three feet of water, and my <br/>
weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I <br/>
should have been drawn under a shaft and <br/>
crushed to death.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1831, while having charge of the flouring <br/>
mill in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsville]], Connecticut, I was stand-<br/>
ing inside of a breast wheel, 20 feet in dia-<br/>
meter, upon one of the arms near the top, <br/>
clearing out the ice, when a full head of water <br/>
was let on to it. The wheel immediately <br/>
started; but I dropped my ax and leaped <br/>
through it to the bottom, by the shaft and <br/>
arms about twenty feet; as I struck the bot-<br/>
tom of the wheel, I was rolled out against a <br/>
ragged stone wall with only about two feet <br/>
clearance between it and the wheel; the <br/>
wheel caught me and rolled me out into the <br/>
water below, where I found myself without <br/>
any bones broken, but with some bruises and <br/>
much fright.</p>

<br/>
[Column 3]<br/>
<p>During the winter of 1831, while in [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New <br/>
Hartford]], Ct., I passed through a severe course <br/>
of lung fever.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1833, the day I was baptized, one of my <br/>
horses, newly sharp shod, kicked my hat off <br/>
my head, and had he struck two inches lower<br/>
would probably have killed me instantly; in<br/>
ten minutes afterwards, while driving the <br/>
same team down a hill on a sleigh without <br/>
any box, the bottom boards slipped forward <br/>
under the roller and caught the ground, turned <br/>
endwise, and fell on the horses' backs, throw-<br/>
ing me between the horses; they ran to the <br/>
bottom of the hill, dragging me with the lines, <br/>
head foremost, with the sleigh on top of me, <br/>
about twenty rods over a smooth snow path: <br/>
I escaped unharmed, however, in the midst of <br/>
both dangers.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1834, while traveling in [[Zion|Zion's Camp]] in <br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]], a rifle was accidentally discharged, <br/>
and the ball passed through three tents, with <br/>
about twelve men in each, and lodged in a <br/>
wagon axle-tree, while a man was standing <br/>
behind it, and injured no one; it passed within <br/>
a few inches of my breast, and many others <br/>
escaped as narrowly as myself.</p>

<br/>
<p>A few months afterwards, a musket, heavily <br/>
loaded with buckshot, was accidentally snap-<br/>
ped within a few feet of me, with the muzzle <br/>
pointed at my breast; it had a good flint and <br/>
was well primed, but it missed fire, and my <br/>
life was again preserved.</p>

<br/>
<p>In April, 1839, in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]], Illinois, I was <br/>
riding upon the running gears of a wagon with-<br/>
out a box, sitting upon the forward axletree, <br/>
when the bolt, fastening the coupling pole, <br/>
came out, which left the hind wheels; and my <br/>
weight on the forward bolster and tongue, <br/>
turned the coupling pole over on to the <br/>
horses, turning the stakes upside down, and <br/>
shut me up fast between the bolster and tongue, <br/>
but in such a manner that my head and <br/>
shoulders dragged on the ground; my horses <br/>
took fright, and ran out into an open prairie<br/>
and dragged me in this position for about half <br/>
a mile. I managed to guide them with my <br/>
left hand, so as to run them into a corner of a <br/>
high worm fence, where we landed in a pile <br/>
together. I was considerably bruised, but es-<br/>
caped without any broken bones.</p>

six days on the way, during which time I was <br/>
severely attacked with bilious fever. The day <br/>
I made my purchase the fever was so high I <br/>
was scarcely sensible of what I was doing. <br/>
As soon as I made my purchase and got my <br/>
freight on board, I took my berth and lay there <br/>

their lives were saved by having a long train <br/>

camp of Israel building up [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]], <br/>
on the west side of the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri river]], (then <br/>
Indian country) I passed through one of the <br/>
most painful and serious misfortunes of my <br/>
life. I took my axe and went two and a half <br/>
miles on to the bluffs to cut some shingle tim-<br/>
ber to cover my cabin; I was accompanied by</p>

<p>[Column 4]<br/>
two men. While the third tree was falling, <br/>
which was an oak, over two feet in diameter, <br/>
I stepped behind it some ten feet, and also to <br/>
one side the same distance, where I thought I <br/>
would be entirely out of danger; but when the <br/>
tree fell, there being a crook in the body of it, <br/>
which struck a knoll on the ground, the whole <br/>
body shot endwise back of the stump and <br/>
bounded, and the butt of the tree struck me on <br/>
the breast and knocked me several feet into <br/>
the air against a standing oak, and the falling <br/>
tree followed me in its bound and caught me <br/>
against the standing tree, and I came down <br/>
between them; before reaching the earth, how-<br/>
ever, I was liberated from them, and struck <br/>
the ground upon my feet in a badly bruised con-<br/>
dition. My left thigh, the whole length of it, <br/>
and my hip and left arm were much bruised; <br/>
my breast bone and three ribs on my left side <br/>
were broken; my lungs, vitals and left side <br/>
were also bruised in a shocking manner. After <br/>
the accident I sat upon a log until Mr. <br/>
[[John Garrison|John Garrison]] went a quarter of a mile to get <br/>
my horse. Notwithstanding I was so badly <br/>
hurt, I mounted my horse, and rode two and a <br/>
half miles over a very rough road, dismount-<br/>
ing twice in consequence of miry places; my <br/>
breast and vitals were so badly torn to pieces, <br/>
that at each step of the horse the pain went <br/>
through me like an arrow. I continued on <br/>
horseback until I arrived at [[Turkey Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turkey creek]], on <br/>
the north side of Winter Quarters. I then be-<br/>
came exhausted, and was taken off my horse <br/>
and carried to my wagon in a chair. I was <br/>
met in the street by Prests. [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], <br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] and others, <br/>
who assisted in carrying me to my family. <br/>
Before laying me upon my bed, the Presidency <br/>
[[laying on of hands|laid hands]] upon me, rebuked my suffering and <br/>
distress in the name of the Lord, and said I <br/>
should live and not die. I was then laid upon <br/>
my bed in my wagon, and as the Apostles pro-<br/>
phesied upon my head, so it came to pass. I <br/>
employed no physician on this occasion, but <br/>
was administered to by the Elders of Israel <br/>
and nursed by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]. I lay upon my bed <br/>
unable to move until my breast bone began to <br/>
knit together, which commenced on the ninth <br/>
day. I began to walk about in twenty days; <br/>
in thirty days from the time I was hurt I again <br/>
commenced to do hard labor.</p>

Eastern States, I drove my carriage, contain-<br/>
ing myself and family into the door yard of <br/>
br. [[James Williams|James Williams]] in [[Iowa|Iowa]], to camp for the <br/>
night. I tied my mules to a large oak tree <br/>
several rods from the carriage. As we were <br/>
about to lay down in the carriage for the night, <br/>
I was strongly impressed to go and move my <br/>
mules from the oak tree, and also to move my <br/>
carriage. I followed the dictates of the Spirit, <br/>
and removed my mules to a small hickory <br/>
grove, also moved my carriage several rods, <br/>
and retired to rest. </p>

<br/>
<p>In a short time a heavy rain storm came on, <br/>
which broke the tree near the ground, and <br/>
laid it prostrate where my carriage had stood. <br/>

pain and showed signs of mortification. I <br/>
showed it to Prest. Young, who advised me to <br/>
cleanse my stomach immediately, and put on <br/>
onion poultices, and anything that would draw <br/>
the poison from my system into my arm, which <br/>
counsel I immediately put in execution. The <br/>
<time datetime=""",04/29/1856

poison had so thoroughly penetrated my whole <br/>
system, that my strength left me; I could not <br/>
stand, I was led to my bed, my bowels and <br/>
stomach ceased to act, my speech was like <br/>
that of a drunken man. Prest. Young called, <br/>
in company with [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Dr. Sprague]], and laid hands <br/>
upon me, and rebuked the disease and the</p>

body, and promised me in the name of the<br/>
Lord, that I should not die but live to finish<br/>
my work which was appointed me upon the<br/>
earth. I soon began to recover. The poison<br/>
and mortification left my system and centered<br/>
in my arm, and was drawn from my arm thro' <br/>
the aid of charcoal poultices, moistened with <br/>
a strong decoction of wormwood, ragweed and <br/>
wild sage; the dead flesh was removed from <br/>
my arm with instruments and lunar caustic,<br/>
and in a few days I was well again.</p>

<br/>
<p>I have occupied considerable space in refer-<br/>
ring to those peculiar circumstances which <br/>
have attended me during life, and to sum the <br/>
matter up it stand thus:—I have broken both <br/>
legs—one in two places—both arms, my breast<br/>
bone and three ribs, and had both ankles dis-<br/>
located. I have been drowned, frozen, scalded, <br/>
and bit by a mad dog—have been in water <br/>
wheels under full head of water—-have passed <br/>
through several severe fits of sickness, and <br/>
encountered poison in its worst forms—have <br/>
landed in a pile of railroad ruins—have barely <br/>
been missed by the passing bullet, and have <br/>
passed through a score of other hair-breadth<br/>
escapes.</p>

<br/>
<p>It has appeared miraculous to me, that with<br/>
all the injuries and broken bones which I have<br/>
had, I have not a lame limb, but have been <br/>
enabled to endure the hardest labor, exposures<br/>
and journeys—have often walked forty, fifty, <br/>
and on one occasion, sixty miles in a day. The <br/>
protection and mercy of God has been over <br/>
me, and my life thus far has been preserved; <br/>
for which blessings I feel to render the grati-<br/>
tude of my heart to my [[Heavenly Father|Heavenly Father]], pray-<br/>

<p>Chapter of Accidents<br/>
written [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|G. S. L. City]] February, 1858</p>

<p>Varied and diverse are the lives and fortunes<br/>
of men, while the paths of some are strew<strike>e</strike>n with <br/>
flowers and ease from the cradle to the grave<br/>
with naught to disturbe their peace, others apparen<br/>
tly are marked victims of vari<strike>at</strike>ed misfortunes, <br/>
accidents, and dangers; the last named class is <br/>
the one, in whose ranks I have <strike>stoood</strike> stood, thro'<br/>
my infancy, childhood, youth &amp; manhood, up to <br/>
the present time, so ^much so,^ that it has seemed as though <br/>
some invis<s>a</s>ible power or fate was watching my <br/>
^foot^steps, in order to find some opportunity to take <br/>
my life from the earth; I can only attribute <br/>
the continuation of my life <strike>on Earth</strike> to the present <br/>
time, to a merciful God, whose hand has been <br/>
stretched out and rescued me from death in <br/>
the midst of many ^of the^ many dangers and hair breadth <br/>
escapes, I have passed through, some of <br/>
which I will here mention. When 3 years of age <br/>
I fell into a caldron of boiling water, was instantly <br/>
caught out, but was so badly scalded, that it was <br/>
nine months <strike>f</strike>before I was considered out of <br/>
danger. <strike>When</strike> at 5 years of age, I fell from the great <br/>
beam of a barn <strike>rafters</strike> ^striking^ my <strike>bare</strike> face upon the <br/>
floor, which came near breaking my neck. Three <br/>
months afterwards, I broke one of my arms, by falling <br/>
down a pair of stairs; I soon after broke my other <br/>
arm by falling out of a high stoop, upon a pile <br/>
of timber. When six years of age, I came near <br/>
being killed by a surly Bull. <strike>^see people apart^</strike> <strike>and was only saved</strike><br/>
<strike>by as it were by a miracle,</strike> ^¶^ <s>d</s>Durring the same year, I went into my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|fathers]] saw mill, with several <br/>
others. I got upon the headblock to take a ride <br/>
while the carriage was running back, not anticipating <br/>
any danger, <strike>but</strike> <strike>before I was aware,</strike> my leg was caught </p>",
371.0,2,,"<p>between the headblock and the fender post, and broke <br/>
both bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken to the <br/>
house and lay nine hours before my bones were <br/>
set, <strike>which time was spent amidst</strike> ^suffering severe pain, but <br/>
being young my bones soon knit<s>t</s> together and in <br/>
a few days, I was again upon my feet; during <br/>
my confinement, by this lameness, my bro., [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]], <br/>
was my companion in the same room <strike>going through</strike> with <br/>
<strike>a course of</strike> the typhus fever. When 7 years of age, I was <br/>
riding on the top of a load of hay, which my uncle,<br/>
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozen Woodruff]], was driving to the barn, he turned <br/>
the load over upon me. I was nearly strangled for <br/>
the want of air, before the hay was removed. ^¶^At 8 <br/>
years <strike>of age</strike> ^old^ I was riding in a one horse wagon with <br/>
several others, the horse took fright ran down a <br/>
steep hill and turned the wagon over upon us; but <br/>
again while in the midst of danger my life was pre-<br/>
served; none of us were seriously injured. When 9 years <br/>
^old^ I climbed into an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon <br/>
a dry limb, which broke and I fell about 15 feet upon <br/>
my back which beat the breath out of my body, a cousin <br/>
ran and told my parents I was dead; before they <br/>
arrived at the spot, I came to my senses and met <br/>
<strike>my parents</strike> ^them^ <strike>coming to me</strike>. When 12 years of age <br/>
I was [[drowned|drownd]] in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington <strike>R</strike>river]], and sunk <br/>
in 30 ft of water, and after carrying one person <br/>
to the bottom with me, I was miraculously saved <br/>
by a young man named [[John Bacon|Bacon]] <strike>by</strike> diving to the <br/>
bottom, and carrying with him a large stone, to <s>holld</s> hold <br/>
him down until he obtained my body, not expecting <br/>
to save <strike>my</strike> <strike>life</strike> ^me alive^: I suffered much in being restored to <br/>
life: ^at 13 years of age^ While passing through [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington meadows]], in the <br/>
depth of winter, the roads were drifted with snow, and in <br/>
an exceedingly blustering day I became so chilled and </p>",
371.0,3,,"<p>overcome with cold, ^so that^ I could not travel. I crawled <br/>
into the hollow of a large apple tree a man in the <br/>
distance seeing me go into ^it^ <strike>the tree</strike> hastened to my <br/>
rescue, realizing my danger more fully than I did<br/>
when he arrived at the spot I had fallen asleep and <br/>
was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in arousing <br/>
me to a sense of my situation, he procured means <br/>
to carry me to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house, and through <br/>
a kind providence my life was again preserved. <br/>
At 14 years of age, I split my left instep open with an ax <br/>
which went nearly through my foot; <strike>and</strike> it was 9 months getting <br/>
well. At 15 year of age, I was bitten in my left hand <br/>
by a mad dog in the last stage of hydrophobia; he only <br/>
dented my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood &amp; <br/>
I was again preserved through the mercies of God <br/>
from an awful death. At the age of 17, <s>I met</s><br/>
<s>with an accident which caused me much suffering</s><br/>
<s>and came near ending my life,</s> I was riding a <br/>
very ill tempered horse, which I was not acquainted <br/>
with, and while going down a very steep ^rocky^ hill, the <br/>
horse <strike>took</strike> <strike>the</strike> ^taking^ advantage of the ground, suddenly <br/>
leaped from the <strike>ground</strike> ^road^, and ran down the <br/>
steep<strike>est part of it</strike> <strike>^the hill^</strike>, amid <strike>the roughest of</strike> the rocks <br/>
at full speed, and commenced kicking up <strike>at</strike> <br/>
<strike>the same time,</strike> and attempted to throw me over <br/>
his head upon the rocks, but I lodged upon the top <br/>
of his head grasped hold of each ear, as with <br/>
a death grasp, expecting every moment to be dashed <br/>
to pieces <strike>among</strike> ^against^ the rocks, while in this position <br/>
sitting astride of his neck with no bridle to guide <br/>
him but his ears, he plunged down the hill under <br/>
full speed until he ran against a rock, <strike>which</strike> ^and^<br/>
dashed <s>him</s> to the ground. I went over both his head <strike>on</strike> <br/>
and the rock, about one rod, and struck the ground <br/>
square on my feet, being the only thing visible that </p>",
371.0,4,,"<p>saved my life, for had I struck upon any other part <br/>
of my body, it must have killed me instantly, as it was <br/>
my bones crushed from under me as though they were <br/>
reeds, it broke my left leg <strike>twice</strike> in two places and <br/>
put out both my ankles in a shocking manner<br/>
and the Horse came near rolling over me in his <br/>
struggles to get up; my uncle, [[Titus Woodruff|Titus Woodruff]], saw <br/>
me fall got assistance <strike>me</strike> and carried me to his house<br/>
I lay from 2 <strike>O'clock</strike> ^pm^ till 10 <strike>at night</strike> without medical aid <br/>
then my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] arrived bringing Dr [[Dr. Swift|Swift]] of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] <br/>
with him who set my bones boxed up my limbs and carried <br/>
me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my fathers;<br/>
my sufferings were very great <strike>yet</strike> I had good attention <br/>
and in 8 weeks I was out doors upon my crutches. <br/>
In 1827 while attempting to clear the ice out of a <br/>
water wheel; standing upon the wheel with one arm <br/>
around the shaft; a man hoisted the gate and <br/>
let a full head of water upon it, as soon as the <br/>
water struck the wheel <strike>it</strike> ^the wheel^ it started, my feet slipped into the wheel <br/>
I immediately plunged head <strike>long</strike> foremost over the <br/>
rim <strike>of the wheel</strike> into about 3 feet of water and my <br/>
weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I should <br/>
have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to <br/>
death. In 1831 while having charge of the flouring <br/>
mill in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsville]] Ct. I was standing inside of a breast <br/>
wheel 20 ft. in diameter, upon one of the arms near the <br/>
top, clearing out the ice, when a full head of water <br/>
was let on to it, it immediately started; but I droped my <br/>
ax and leaped through the wheel to the bottom of it, by <br/>
the shaft and arms about 20 feet: as I struck the bottom <br/>
of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone <br/>
wall with only about 2 feet <strike>of water</strike> clearance <br/>
between it and the wheel, the wheel caught me and <br/>
rolled me out into the water below where I found myself <br/>
with-out any bones broken, but with some bruses and much fright.  </p>",
371.0,5,,"<p>During the winter of 1831, while in [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New hartford]], Ct. <br/>
I passed through a severe <strike>fit of sickness</strike> course of <br/>

<s>of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints;</s> one of my horses, newly <br/>
<strike>caught</strike> ^sharp shod^, kicked my hat off my head and had he struck <br/>
2 inches lower, would probably have killed me instantly, <br/>
in 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same team <br/>
down a hill on a sleigh without any box the bottom <br/>
boards slipped forward under the roller and caught <br/>
the ground, turned end ways and fell on the horses' <br/>
backs, ^throwing me <strike>between</strike>^ between the horses, they ran to the bottom of the <br/>
hill dragging me <strike>by</strike> ^with^ the lines, head foremost with <br/>
the sleigh on top of me about 20 rods over a smooth <br/>
snow path, I escaped unharmed however, in the <br/>
midst of both dangers. In 1834 while traveling in <br/>
[[Zion|Zion's camp]] in [[Missouri|Mo.]] a rifle was accidentally discharged <br/>
and the ball passed through 3 tents with about 12 men <br/>
in each, and lodged in a wagon axletree while a <br/>
man was standing behind it, <strike>it</strike> ^and^ injured no one <br/>
^it^ passed within a few inches of my breast, and many <br/>
others escaped as narrowly as myself: a few months <br/>

way as the scriptures represent it to be, that but few should<br/>
find &amp; walk in it. Much less did I in my weakness conceive<br/>
the many artful &amp; cunning devices of Satan to draw the<br/>
[[child of God|child of God]] from the paths of holiness I had not yet learnt<br/>
by experience that the Devil like a roaring Lion goeth about<br/>
seeking whom he may devour and that he grasps with his<br/>
deadly claws every one that turns aside from the Highway<br/>
of Holiness. But as I turned and set my face Zion ward and<br/>
began to take up my march thither I soon began to hear<br/>
the — at first but whispered suggestions of the Adversary trying to<br/>
win me back to his service and I soon began to feel his firey<br/>
darts levelled and hurled at me from almost every quarter<br/>
I soon found that I had enlisted as a Soldier in a warfare<br/>
and that I must act not only the offensive but likewise<br/>
the defensive part and if I would gain the prize I must<br/>
fight. But I had yet (as a raw undiciplined recruit) to learn the<br/>
use of the armour with which Christians fight their battles<br/>
and from whom I could expect help from trouble</p>

<br/>
<p>I could not wield with ease the Sword of the Spirit and the<br/>
Shield of Faith though a comfortable garment ^&amp; armour^, did not fit<br/>
my body Shapen and conceive in Sin, in fine the garments<br/>
of Salvation could not be expected to fit perfectly, and set<br/>
with ease on one who had so long been clothed with shame<br/>
and clad with the filthy garments of Unrighteousness<br/>
But I had yet to learn of My Captain, of Him who is meek<br/>
and lowly some simple &amp; humble lessons of Christianity<br/>
before I could make much resistance with the enemy<br/>
in case of an open attack. Encouraging thought that<br/>
the Captain of our Salvation being in all points tempted<br/>
as we are is able to succour those that are tempted<br/>
and that he will with every temptation provide<br/>
a way for our escape</p>

</p><p>HISTORY <br/>
OF <br/>
WILFORD WOODRUFF.<br/>
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-</p>

<br/>
<p>At an early age my mind was exer-<br/>
cised upon religious subjects, although<br/>
I never made a profession until 1830. <br/>
I did not then join any church, for<br/>
the reason that I could not find any <br/>
denomination whose doctrines, faith<br/>
or practice, agreed with the Gospel of <br/>
Jesus Christ, or the ordinances and <br/>
gifts which the Apostles taught. <br/>
Although the ministers of the day <br/>
taught that the faith, gifts, graces, <br/>
miracles and ordinances, which the <br/>
ancient Saints enjoyed, were done<br/>
away and no longer needed, I did not <br/>
believe it to be true, only as they <br/>
were done away through the unbelief <br/>
of the children of men. I believed <br/>
the same gifts, graces, miracles and <br/>
power would be manifest in one age of <br/>
the world as in another, when God had <br/>
a Church upon the earth, and that the <br/>
Church of God would be re-established<br/>
upon the earth, and that I should live<br/>
to see it. These principles were rivet-<br/>
ed upon my mind from the perusal <br/>
of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New Testament]], with <br/>
fervent prayer that the Lord would<br/>
show me what was right and wrong, <br/>
and lead me in the path of salvation,<br/>
without any regard to the opinions of<br/>
man; and the whisperings of the Spirit<br/>
of the Lord for the space of three <br/>
years, taught me that he was about to <br/>
set up his Church and kingdom upon <br/>
the earth in the last days. I was<br/>
taught these things from my youth by <br/>
[[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], an aged man, who <br/>
lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]], Conn., who was<br/>
frequently called the old prophet <br/>
Mason. He taught me many things <br/>
which are now coming to pass. He <br/>
did not believe that any man had <br/>
authority to administer in the ordi-<br/>
nances of the Gospel, but believed it<br/>
was our privilege, through faith, prayer <br/>
and fasting, to heal the sick and cast <br/>
out devils by the [[laying on of hands|laying on of hands]], <br/>
which was the case under his admini-<br/>
stration, as many could testify.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1832, I was inspired to go to <br/>
[[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]; my brother, [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]],<br/>
was also directed by the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]]<br/>
to go to the same place. When we<br/>
met, we both told our impressions,<br/>
and it caused us to marvel and wonder<br/>
what the Lord wanted of us in [[Rhode Island|Rhode<br/>
Island]]; but, as we had made prepara-<br/>
tions to move to the west, we let out-<br/>
ward circumstances control us, and,<br/>
Jonah like, instead of going to Rhode<br/>
Island, we went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego <br/>
county, New York, and there remained <br/>
until <time datetime=""",12/29/1833

ders [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] and [[Elijah Cheney|Elijah  <br/>

and I believed their testimony, enter-<br/>
tained the Elders, and offered our-<br/>
selves for baptism the first sermon we<br/>
heard. We read the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mor-<br/>
mon]], and I received a testimony that<br/>
it was true.</p>

<br/>
<p>We soon learned what the Lord <br/>
wanted of us in Rhode Island, for at<br/>
the time we were warned to go there, <br/>
two of the Elders were preaching there, <br/>
and had we gone, we should have em-<br/>
braced the Work at that time.</p>

sixty miles to the town of [[Fabius, Onondaga County, New York|Fabius]], to <br/>
attend an evening meeting of the <br/>
Saints in that place, where Elder Pul-<br/>

<br/>
<p>The Prophet Joseph invited me to<br/>
make his house my home; I accepted <br/>
his offer, and staid with him about <br/>
one week. I became acquainted with <br/>
many of the High Priests, Elders and<br/>
Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirt-<br/>
land, and heard many of the Elders<br/>
speak, and I felt to rejoice before God <br/>
for the light and knowledge which was <br/>
manifested to me during that day.</p>

<br/>
<p>After we had pitched our tents in <br/>
[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay county]], (our numbers being 205) <br/>
and many of the brethren had taken <br/>
sick, and some had died, Joseph re-<br/>
quested the camp to disperse, except <br/>
enough to take care of the sick. All<br/>
who had teams were required to leave <br/>
the ground and go among the bre-<br/>
thren. I went to brother [[Lyman Wight|Lyman<br/>
Wight's]], in company with [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman <br/>
Hyde]] and [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. Shortly, <br/>
Joseph called the brethren together at <br/>
Lyman Wight's, and told them if they<br/>
would humble themselves before the<br/>
Lord, and covenant to keep His com-<br/>
mandments and obey His counsel, the <br/>
plague should be stayed from that<br/>
hour, and there should not be another <br/>

Kirtland with many of the brethren;<br/>
I remained with Lyman Wight, labor-<br/>
ing with my hands till the following <br/>

<br/>
<p>I had a great desire to preach the <br/>
Gospel, which I did not name to my <br/>
brethren; but one Sunday evening I <br/>
retired into the woods alone, and <br/>
called upon the Lord in earnest prayer, <br/>
to open my way to go and preach the <br/>
Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth. <br/>
The Spirit of the Lord bore witness <br/>
that my prayer was heard, and should <br/>
be answered. I arose from my knees<br/>
happy, and walked some forty rods, <br/>
and met [[Elias Higbee|Elias Higbee]], a High Priest,<br/>
with whom I had staid a number of <br/>
months. As I approached him, he <br/>
said, ""Brother Wilford, the Spirit of<br/>
the Lord tells me that you should be <br/>
ordained, and go on a mission."" I re-<br/>
plied, ""I am ready.""</p>

I told him I was as ready to go south <br/>

through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson county]], as it lay in<br/>
our route. He replied, it would be at <br/>
the risk of life, and he had not faith <br/>
enough to undertake it; if I had, I <br/>
might try it. I also asked him, if I <br/>
went through Jackson county, if I<br/>
should start without purse or scrip,</p>

strenuous to keep the commandments, <br/>
so I started without money. I called <br/>
upon Elder [[Harry Brown|Harry Brown]], and asked<br/>
him to accompany me; he consented, <br/>

judgments might rest upon the wicked<br/>

263.0,6,,""">June [January] 18</time>—We called at the [[Harmony Mission, Bates County, Missouri|Har-<br/>
mony mission]], and had an interview <br/>
with the President, a [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]]<br/>
minister. Although it was near sun-<br/>
down, he would neither give us any-<br/>
thing to eat, nor lodge us, because we <br/>
were ""Mormons."" It was fifteen<br/>
miles to the nearest house, which was <br/>
[[Michel Geraud|Jerrew's]] Indian trading house. We <br/>
asked the minister to direct us there.<br/>
He gave us directions, but the Spirit <br/>
said to me he was deceiving us. I <br/>
asked him three times, and he declared <br/>
he was telling us the truth. We <br/>
followed his directions, and we came<br/>
to the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage river]] swamp, where we <br/>
were lost in the darkness of the night. <br/>
We followed the river, but as it is <br/>
very crooked, we made but little pro-<br/>
gress. After travelling through mud <br/>
and water for one hour, we concluded<br/>
to go out on the open prairie, and lie <br/>
down in the grass until morning; but <br/>
when we got out into the prairie, we<br/>
heard the [[Osage People|Osage]] Indians' drum and<br/>
shout at the trading house, as they</p>

proached, we were met by a dozen <br/>
large savage looking dogs; they smelt<br/>
us in a friendly manner, but did not <br/>
attempt to bite nor bark. We ar-<br/>
rived about midnight, covered with <br/>
mud, hungry and weary, and were<br/>
kindly received and entertained for <br/>
the remainder of the night by Mr. <br/>
[[Michel Geraud|Jerrew]], who had an [[Osage People|Osage]] squaw for <br/>
a wife; she prepared us a good supper,<br/>
but marvelled that we did not drink <br/>
coffee. She proffered us their best<br/>
bed, which was highly ornamented, <br/>
but we declined her kind offer, as we<br/>
were wet and muddy. She made us a<br/>
good bed of mackinaw blankets, before<br/>
a large fire, and we slept comfortably. <br/>
May the Lord reward both Mr. Jerrew <br/>
and wife, and the [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] mini-<br/>
ster, according their deserts.</p>

<br/>
<p><time datetime=""",01/19/1835
263.0,8,,""">June [January] 19</time>—Mr. [[Michel Geraud|Jerrew]] gave us a <br/>
good breakfast, put us across the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage <br/>
river]] in a canoe, and we started upon <br/>
our long day's walk, it being sixty <br/>
miles to the nearest house. We had<br/>
not anything with us to eat. Most of <br/>
our travels through the day was<br/>
through prairie; before dark we en-<br/>
tered timbered land; as we approached <br/>
the timber, a large black bear met us; <br/>
we had no weapons. When the bear got<br/>
within about six rods of us, he rose upon<br/>
his hind feet, and examined us a short <br/>
time, and went off. We were soon<br/>
enveloped in such thick darkness, that <br/>
it was with great difficulty we could <br/>
keep the road, and surrounded by a<br/>
large drove of wolves, which kept up <br/>
a continual howling, and would fre-<br/>
quently rush to within a few feet of us. <br/>
We travelled about two hours in this <br/>
situation, feeling that we were in <br/>
danger, and concluded to stop and <br/>
build a fire, and wait till morning.<br/>
Accordingly, we built a large fire,<br/>
which drove the wolves off; and as <br/>
we were about to lie down, we heard<br/>
a dog bark, and a bell. We felt <br/>
assured we were near a house; both <br/>
of us took a brand of fire, and on going <br/>
about one quarter of a mile, we came <br/>
to a log hut, which was occupied by <br/>
[[Mr. Williams|Mr. Williams]], who had been in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jack-<br/>
son county]] during the mobbing of the</p>

",
263.0,9,1835-01-24,"<p></p><p>Saints, and had lately moved here, <br/>
depending upon his gun mostly for <br/>
his living. It was sixty miles to a<br/>
house on the north, and twelve miles<br/>
on the south. [[Mr. Williams|He]] and his family were <br/>
living in a small old log hut, about <br/>
twelve feet square, and one bed in the<br/>
room, upon which lay his wife, several<br/>
children and three young dogs. He <br/>
lay stretched out upon the bare floor, <br/>
with his feet to a small fire. There <br/>
was no door to the house, but a rag-<br/>
ged quilt hung up in the door way; it <br/>
was past eleven o'clock at night. I <br/>
turned away the quilt, looked into the<br/>
house, and spoke three times; no one<br/>
stirred, not even a dog. I walked in, <br/>
and laid my hands upon the man's <br/>
shoulder, and spoke to him. The mo-<br/>
ment he felt the weight of my hand, <br/>
he leaped to his feet, and commenced <br/>
running around the room, leaping as <br/>
high as he could each jump. I told <br/>
him not to be frightened, as we were <br/>
travellers and friends, and did not<br/>
wish to hurt him, but wished to stop <br/>
with him over night. When he came <br/>
to his senses, he gave us permission to <br/>
stop with him till morning, if we <br/>
would take the bare floor, as he did. <br/>
We asked for something to eat, as we <br/>
had walked sixty miles without a<br/>
morsel of food. He replied, he had <br/>
nothing for us, and assured us he had <br/>
to kill game for his breakfast in the<br/>
morning. He informed us that the<br/>
reason of his fright, was in conse-<br/>
quence of his having shot a large [[panther|pan-<br/>
ther]], a few nights previous, standing<br/>
in his door, and he thought his mate <br/>
had lit upon him. We lay down upon <br/>
the floor, and we were glad of this<br/>
place, as it soon began to rain, and <br/>
rained through the night.</p>

<br/>
<p>In the morning we arose, and went <br/>
on in the rain twelve miles, to a [[Mr. Connor|Mr. <br/>
Conner's]], who was also in the [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson<br/>
county]] mob. He gave us breakfast, <br/>
but damned us while we were eating, <br/>
because we were ""Mormons."" When<br/>
we had finished a hearty breakfast,<br/>
we thanked him very politely, and<br/>
went on our way, leaving him swear-<br/>
ing. We felt thankful for breakfast, <br/>
for we had walked seventy-two miles <br/>
without eating food. We taught from <br/>
house to house as we journeyed.</p>

<br/>
<p><time datetime=""",01/24/1835
263.0,9,,""">Jan. 24</time>—I preached at Mr. [[Nathan Tanner|Nathan<br/>
Tanner]]'s, in [[Greene County, Missouri|Green county]], Missouri, <br/>
the first time we had found a congre-<br/>
gation we could preach to in safety,<br/>
and the first time that I had ever <br/>
attempted to preach as a missionary. <br/>
I had great liberty, and was followed<br/>
by Elder [[Henry Brown|Brown]]. During our preach-<br/>
ing, there was a snow storm.</p>

<br/>
<p>We arrived at [[Cedar Creek, Petit Jean, Conway County, Arkansas Territory|Petty John Creek]], in <br/>
Arkansas, where Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Alexander Ake-<br/>
man]] resided, with a large family of <br/>
[[William Akeman|son]]s and [[Delilah Adaline Akeman Gibbs|one daughter]], settled around <br/>
him. Mr. Akeman, and a part of the <br/>
family, were members of the Church<br/>
in Jackson county; [[Prudence Stockton Akeman|his wife]] died<br/>
strong in the faith in Missouri. His<br/>
whole family were mobbed, and some<br/>
of [[Wright Akeman|his son]]s were whipped severely;<br/>
but he could not stand the persecution <br/>
and the loss of his property. He<br/>
moved to Arkansas, to get rid of <br/>
""Mormonism,"" had apostatized, and <br/>
was bitter against the Work. When<br/>
we called upon him, he opposed us <br/>
strongly—spoke against the leaders of <br/>
the Church and the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]]. <br/>
He had one son who received us, and <br/>
had a little faith. I dreamed the <br/>
night before, that we were required to<br/>
walk in a straight, narrow path; and <br/>
while following the path, it led to the<br/>
door of a house, which was placed in<br/>
a high wall that we could not get<br/>
around. As I opened the door to go <br/>
through, I saw the room was filled <br/>
with large serpents. I entered, and <br/>
they all coiled up to jump at me; as <br/>
they made a spring to bite me, they<br/>
all fell dead at my feet, turned black, <br/>
swelled up, burst open, took fire, and <br/>
were consumed before my eyes.</p>

<br/>
<p>We met with much opposition from <br/>
Mr. Akeman, and many in the neigh-<br/>
borhood. Elder Brown wished to <br/>
leave the place immediately. I told <br/>
him I should stay, and see my dream<br/>
fulfilled. We staid in the neighbor-<br/>
hood twenty-five days, during which<br/>
time the Lord brought judgment upon<br/>
those who threatened to mob and kill <br/>
us; many of them died suddenly, and<br/>
I was warned three times by the Lord, <br/>
to go to Mr. Akeman, and bear testi-<br/>
mony unto him of the truth of ""Mor-<br/>
monism,"" and the wickedness of his <br/>
course in opposing it; and the last <br/>
time I called upon him, he was filled <br/>
with wrath against me, and when I <br/>
left his house, he followed me in a<br/>
rage, apparently with some evil intent.</p>

",
263.0,10,1835-02-14,"<p></p><p>When I had got a few rods from his <br/>
door, [[Alexander Akeman|he]] was nearly treading on my<br/>
heels, and fell dead at my feet, as<br/>
though he had been struck with light-<br/>
ning; he swelled, and immediately <br/>
turned black. This created a great<br/>
wailing and mourning among his <br/>
family. Brother [[Henry Brown|Brown]] and myself <br/>
assisted in laying him out and burying<br/>
him. He died <time datetime=""",02/14/1835
263.0,10,,""">Feb. 14, 1835</time>.</p>

<br/>
<p>This singular dispensation of Provi-<br/>
dence brought solemnity upon the <br/>
people, and they began to reflect and <br/>
wished to hear preaching. We held<br/>
several meetings and preached, and<br/>
baptized Mr. [[Jonathan Hubbel|Hubbel]] and his [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|wife]], <br/>
who had opened their doors and given <br/>
us a home; and just as we had got <br/>
the people prepared to receive the<br/>
Gospel and anxious to learn, and plead-<br/>
ing with us to stay and preach, bro-<br/>
Brown resolved that he would con-<br/>
tinue his journey south. I was fully <br/>
satisfied that should we stop, we <br/>
would built up a Church, and was<br/>
convinced it was our duty to stop; <br/>
but brother Brown held the office of<br/>
an Elder, and I submitted.</p>

<br/>
<p>Brother Brown did not baptize ano-<br/>
ther person on the mission.</p>

the [[Arkansas River, United States|river]] ten miles, and tied up our <br/>
canoe on the east bank, and stopped<br/>
with Mr. Jones. I preached next day <br/>
at his house. On the <time datetime=""",03/16/1835
263.0,12,1835-03-24,""">16th</time> we left our <br/>
canoe with Mr. Jones, and walked <br/>
back up the river ten miles, opposite<br/>
Little Rock, and took the old military<br/>
road, and started to wade the Missis-<br/>
sippi swamp, which was mostly cov-<br/>
ered with water from Little Rock, <br/>
Arkansas, to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee, a <br/>
distance of about 175 miles. We<br/>
waded through mud and water knee <br/>
deep, day after day, and in some in-<br/>
stances forty miles per day, before we <br/>
could get a stopping place.</p>

<br/>
<p>On the <time datetime=""",03/24/1835
263.0,12,1835-03-27,""">24th</time>, while in the swamps, <br/>
I had an attack of the rheumatism, and <br/>
could not travel fast. My companion,<br/>
brother [[Henry Brown|Brown]], had got in a hurry, <br/>
and wished to return to his family in <br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]; and as I could not travel as <br/>
fast as he wished, we parted. He <br/>
left me sitting on a log in the mud<br/>
and water; I was lame and unable to <br/>
walk, without food, and twelve miles <br/>
from the nearest house on the road. <br/>
He went out of sight in great haste.<br/>
I then knelt down in the water, and<br/>
prayed to the Lord to heal me. The <br/>
Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, <br/>
and I was healed; the pain left me; <br/>
I arose and went my way. Whenever<br/>
I met with one or more families, I<br/>
preached and bore testimony to them.</p>

<br/>
<p>I crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] in the <br/>
evening of the <time datetime=""",03/27/1835
263.0,12,1835-04-04,""">27th</time> of March, and <br/>
stayed at a public house kept by Mr.<br/>
[[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]]. I was suspected of<br/>
being an impostor. Mr. Jackson <br/>
believed I was one of [[John Andrews Murrell|Murril's]] clan, <br/>
who were then murdering and steal-<br/>
ing negroes; and to test me, he <br/>
gathered together a large house full <br/>
of the most wicked and corrupt peo-<br/>
ple in the city, and set me to preach-<br/>
ing, to see whether I could preach or <br/>
not.</p>

<br/>
<p>I do not think that Mr. Jackson, or <br/>
the same company of men and women, <br/>
will ever meet together again for the <br/>
same purpose, for they would not like <br/>
again to have their sins and abomina-<br/>
tions revealed to each other as point-<br/>
edly as I told them that night, through <br/>
the inspiration of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]];<br/>
they were glad to get rid of me upon<br/>
almost any terms.</p>

not cross without swimming our <br/>

lost in the thick woods, amidst the<br/>
rain, wind, creeks and fallen tree-<br/>

by riding off precipitous bluffs, a <br/>
bright light suddenly shone round <br/>
about us, and revealed our perilous <br/>
situation, as we were upon the edge of <br/>

<br/>
<p><time datetime=""",06/19/1836

issued against [[David Wyman Patten|D. W. Patten]], [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren<br/>
Parrish]] and Wilford Woodruff, sworn <br/>
out by [[Matthew Williams|Matthew Williams]], a Metho-<br/>
dist priest, and served by the sheriff, <br/>
[[Robert C. Petty|Robert C. Petty]]. Elders Patten and <br/>
Parrish were taken by an armed mob <br/>
of about fifty, under pretence of law,<br/>
led by the sheriff, a colonel, first and <br/>
second major, with other officers, and <br/>
a [[Methodist|Methodist]] priest with a gun upon his <br/>
shoulder. I was in another county, <br/>
and therefore not taken. We were<br/>
accused of prophesying falsely, by <br/>
saying that four persons who were <br/>
baptized should receive the [[Holy Ghost|Holy<br/>
Ghost]] in twenty-four hours, and that <br/>
Christ should come the [[Second Coming of Jesus Christ|second]] time<br/>
before this generation passed away. <br/>
The whole concern was a mob mock <br/>
trial, contrary to law, justice, judg-<br/>
ment or truth.</p>

<br/>
<p>On the <time datetime=""",06/29/1836
263.0,14,1836-07-14,""">29th</time>, I went to a Baptist<br/>
meeting-house, on [[Thompson Creek, Weakley County, Tennessee|Thompson's creek]], <br/>
to preach; the house was crowded. <br/>
As I rose to speak, a [[Baptist|Baptist]] priest, <br/>
Mr. [[Parson Browning|Browning]], arrived at the door on <br/>
horseback, and stepped in greatly <br/>
agitated, and told the deacon to forbid <br/>
my preaching in the house, at the<br/>
same time commenced a tirade of <br/>
abuse against the ""Mormons,"" telling<br/>
several lies, which I corrected before<br/>
the people, which increased his rage.<br/>
As I was forbidden to preach in the <br/>
house, and had been invited, and tra-<br/>
velled many miles to fulfil my ap-<br/>
pointment, I told the people I would<br/>
like to preach, and was willing to <br/>
stand on a wood pile, a fence, a cart, <br/>
or any place they would appoint. A <br/>
man rose and said he owned the land <br/>
in front of the meeting-house, and I <br/>
might stand and preach on that, and<br/>
welcome. All the congregation, with<br/>
the exception of the minister and one<br/>
deacon, arose and left the house, <br/>
walked across the street, and formed <br/>
seats of a worm fence, and gave good<br/>
attention while I preached for an hour <br/>
and-a-half, on the principles of the<br/>
Gospel.</p>

<br/>
<p>When I closed, Mr. [[Randolph Alexander|Randolph Alex-<br/>
ander]], who had never heard a ""Mor-<br/>
mon"" Elder speak before, said, the <br/>
people of the present day made him<br/>
think of a pen of hogs; the keeper<br/>
would make a trough, and pour into<br/>
it hot or cold water, dish water, or <br/>
anything else, and they would drink <br/>
it; but let a stranger come along, and <br/>
pour over a basket of corn on the back <br/>
side of the pen, and the hogs would <br/>
be frightened, and run and snort all <br/>
over the pen. He said it was so with <br/>
the people; the priests would feed<br/>
them with any kind of doctrine, no <br/>
matter how false, the people will <br/>
swallow it down; but let a stranger<br/>
come and preach the Gospel of Jesus<br/>
Christ, which will save the people, as <br/>
Mr. Woodruff has done, and the peo-<br/>
ple are afraid of him.</p>

answered in the affirmative. I took<br/>

Elder [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], the Baptist minister, <br/>

that our doctrine was true, and he<br/>
had a hard struggle in his mind to <br/>
know which to do, receive or reject it; <br/>
he finally resolved to reject it, and <br/>
commenced preaching against us. He<br/>
sent for Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]], Methodist<br/>
minister, on the [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Island]], to come <br/>
and help him; he had been long at <br/>
variance with Mr. Douglass, but they <br/>
became very friendly and united in a<br/>

<p>HISTORY<br/>

WILFORD WOODRUFF.<br/>
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-</p>

<br/>
<p>I followed Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglas]] to his own<br/>
[[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|island]], and commenced preaching to<br/>
his church, and baptized a good share <br/>
of his members, among whom were<br/>
several sea captains. Ministers from <br/>
the main land were sent for, who<br/>
came over and tried to put a stop to<br/>
the work, by preaching and lying<br/>
about us; but the work continued to <br/>
roll on. They wished me to work a<br/>
miracle to convince them that my doc-<br/>
trine was true. I told them they had <br/>
rejected the truth, and they would <br/>
see signs, but not unto salvation.</p>

<br/>
<p>[[Vinalhaven, Waldo County, Maine|Vinal Haven]], which includes both <br/>
[[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|north]] and south Fox Island, is in lat.<br/>
44°, long. 69°10'. The inhabitants <br/>
are generally healthy and industrious, <br/>
and hospitable to strangers, the people <br/>
obtain most of their wealth by fishing, <br/>
and fit out annually over one hundred <br/>
licensed vessels, beside many smaller <br/>
crafts. The north island is nine miles<br/>
long and two wide; population 800, <br/>
and contains a post office, a store, <br/>
a grist mill, four school houses, and a <br/>
Baptist church. The land is rocky <br/>
and rough, yet there are farms which <br/>
produce good wheat, barley, oats, <br/>
potatoes and grass; the principal<br/>
timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and <br/>
birch. The rasp and gooseberry grow<br/>
in great abundance. Sheep are the<br/>
principal stock.</p>

<br/>
<p>South Fox island is about ten miles<br/>
long and five wide, and is a mass of<br/>
rocks, principally granite, formed into <br/>
shelves, hills, hollows, and cut up into <br/>
nooks, points and ravines by coves<br/>
and harbors; population 1000. There<br/>
are some small patches under cultiva-<br/>
tion, at the expense of great labor and <br/>
toil. Many resident fishermen fish at <br/>
[[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and bring them home, <br/>
and dry them upon flakes; they annu-<br/>
ally supply the market with a great<br/>
amount of codfish, mackerel and <br/>
boxed herring. The latter island <br/>
contains two stores, three tide saw <br/>
mills, six school houses, a small branch</p>

",
263.0,23,1837-09-07,"<p></p><p>of the [[Methodist|Methodist]] church and a priest. <br/>
The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hem-<br/>
lock and birch, also gooseberries,<br/>
raspberries, whortleberries and upland<br/>
cranberries; bushes and timber grow <br/>
out of the crevices of the rocks.</p>

<br/>
<p>There is a great amount and variety<br/>
of fish in the waters around these <br/>
Islands, viz.: whale, black fish, shark,<br/>
ground shark, pilot fish, horse<br/>
mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, halibut, <br/>
cod, pollock, tomcod, hake, haddock, <br/>
mackerel, shad, bass, alewives, herring,<br/>
pohagen, dolphin, whiting, frost fish,<br/>
flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, shad, <br/>
cusk, blue backs, scollop, dogfish, <br/>
muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five fin-<br/>
gers, monkfish, nursefish, sunfish,<br/>
swordfish, thrasher, cat, scuppog, two-<br/>
tog, eyefish, cunner, ling eels, lobsters, <br/>
clams, mussels, winkels, porpoises, <br/>
seals, &amp;c.</p>

<br/>
<p><time datetime=""",07/22/1839
263.0,28,1839-07-25,""">July 22</time>—I was with President <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and his Council and the<br/>
Twelve; it was a day of God's power<br/>
with the Prophet. He healed many <br/>
who were sick nigh unto death, among <br/>
whom were [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]] and<br/>
[[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Nobles]]; even the wicked <br/>
rabble followed to see the sick healed. <br/>
As Joseph was about to cross the<br/>
[[Mississippi River, United States|river]], a man came to him and asked <br/>
him if he would go about three miles <br/>
and heal two of his small children, <br/>
who were twins, about three months <br/>
old, and were sick nigh unto death. <br/>
He was a man of the world, he had<br/>
never heard a sermon preached by a <br/>
Latter-day Saint. Joseph said he <br/>
could not go, but he would send a <br/>
man. After hesitating a moment, he<br/>
turned to me and said, ""You go with <br/>
this man and heal his children,"" at<br/>
the same time giving me a red silk <br/>
handkerchief, and said, ""After you <br/>
lay hands upon them, wipe their faces <br/>
with it, and they shall be healed; and <br/>
as long as you will keep that handker-<br/>
chief, it shall ever remain as a league <br/>
between you and me."" I went and <br/>
did as I was commanded, and the <br/>
children were healed.</p>

<br/>
<p>On the <time datetime=""",07/25/1839
263.0,28,1839-08-08,""">25th</time>, I was attacked with<br/>
chills and fever. I had a chill every <br/>
other day, and was very sick.</p>

<br/>
<p><time datetime=""",08/08/1839
263.0,28,,""">August 8</time>—I laid my hands upon<br/>
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children, blessed them,<br/>
committed them into the hands of <br/>
God, and started upon my English <br/>
mission, leaving my family sick, and <br/>
with not more than four days' pro-<br/>
visions. Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] <br/>
rowed me across the Mississippi in a <br/>
boat; I was sick and feeble. When</p>

",
263.0,29,1839-08-24,"<p></p><p>I landed, I laid down upon the bank<br/>
of the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] on a side of sole leather. <br/>
The Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] came along and <br/>
looked at me, and said, ""You are<br/>
starting on your mission."" I said<br/>
yes, but I look like a poor instrument<br/>
for a missionary; I look more fit for<br/>
a hospital or dissecting room than a<br/>
mission. He replied, ""What do you <br/>
say that for? Go ahead in the name <br/>
of the Lord, and you shall be healed <br/>
and blessed on your mission."" I <br/>
thanked him. A brother came along<br/>
with a wagon, and carried me a few <br/>
miles on my road. I started without <br/>
purse or scrip, and passed by [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley<br/>
P. Pratt]], who was hewing logs for a <br/>
house; he was bare-footed, bare-<br/>
headed, without coat or vest on. He <br/>
said, ""I have no money, but I have<br/>
an empty purse; I will give you that."" <br/>
I went a few rods, and found Elder <br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] building a log cabin. <br/>
He said, ""I have one dollar, I will <br/>
give you that to put in your purse.""<br/>
He blessed me, and I went my way, <br/>
accompanied by Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]. <br/>
I had a shake of the ague every other <br/>
day, and lay on the bottom of the<br/>
wagon while I travelled.</p>

<br/>
<p>We staid with [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel H.]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don<br/>
Carlos Smith]] at [[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]], and held a <br/>
meeting with the Saints, who contri-<br/>
buted $9 to our necessities, and [[George Miller|George<br/>
Miller]] gave us a horse. Father Colt-<br/>
rin was going east; he took us into <br/>
his wagon to help us along. We <br/>
spent five days in [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], where<br/>
Elder Taylor printed fifteen hundred <br/>
copies of a pamphlet upon the [[Missouri|Mis-<br/>
souri]] persecution. We sold our horse, <br/>
and left on the 21st, and continued <br/>
our journey. We spent the night of<br/>
the <time datetime=""",08/24/1839

Taylor fell to the ground as though he<br/>
had been knocked down. We admini-<br/>
stered to him, and he revived. On <br/>
the following day he fell again, and<br/>
fainted several times; it seemed as<br/>
though the destroyer would take his<br/>
life. We travelled with him four days<br/>
after he was taken sick. His sickness<br/>
proved to be bilious fever. We stop-<br/>
ped with him two days at a German <br/>
tavern, in [[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]], Wayne county,<br/>
Indiana, with a kind family with<br/>
whom he was acquainted. Father <br/>
Coltrin would stay no longer. I pro-<br/>
posed to remain with Brother Taylor,<br/>
but as I was sick with fever and ague, <br/>
and not able to take care of myself, <br/>
brother Taylor advised me to continue<br/>
my journey with Father [[Zebedee Coltrin|Coltrin]], say-<br/>
ing, ""It is easier to take care of one<br/>
sick man than two."" I committed<br/>
him into the hands of God, and the<br/>
family promised to do all in their <br/>
power to make him comfortable. I <br/>
parted from him with a heavy heart.</p>

263.0,31,1840-04-22,""">9th April</time>, I had an appoint-<br/>
ment at [[Hawcross, Redmarley D|Haw Cross]]. As I was going<br/>
into the meeting, letters were put into <br/>
my hands from Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] <br/>
and others, informing me of his arri-<br/>
val with five of the Twelve, and re-<br/>
questing me to come to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], and<br/>
attend a General Conference. A vast <br/>
assembly had gathered to attend my <br/>
meeting; the house, yard and street<br/>
were crowded; a mob had also gather-<br/>
ed. I preached to the people; five <br/>
came forward to be baptized. The <br/>
mob surrounded the pool, armed with<br/>
stones. I dismissed the meeting and <br/>
went away, but the congregation and <br/>
mob remained on the ground till mid-<br/>
night; and as there was no prospect <br/>
of their dispersing, and the candidates<br/>
were anxious to be baptized, I went <br/>
down into the water and baptized five, <br/>
in the midst of a shower of stones. <br/>
The water was all in a foam for a rod <br/>
around me. None that I baptized <br/>
were hit, and I was only hit twice, <br/>
once on my hip and once on my head; <br/>
the blow on my head raised a large <br/>
bump, which went away while I was <br/>
confirming. Subsequently I baptized<br/>
many of the mob.</p>

ministers became so alarmed for their <br/>
flocks in that part of the vineyard, <br/>
they petitioned Parliament to adopt <br/>
measures to stop our preaching. They<br/>
received for an answer, that if they<br/>

view I have written sketches of most<br/>

have heard from the mouth of Joseph <br/>
Smith the Prophet, and many of the <br/>
teachings of the Twelve Apostles and <br/>

<p>CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.</p>

<br/>
<p>(Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], Feb. 1858.)</p>

<br/>
<p>Varied and diverse are the lives <br/>
and fortunes of men; while the paths <br/>
of some are strewn with flowers and <br/>
ease from the cradle to the grave, <br/>
with naught to disturb their peace, <br/>
others are marked victims of varied<br/>
misfortunes, accidents and dangers. <br/>
The last-named class is the one in <br/>
whose ranks I have stood through my<br/>
infancy, childhood, youth and man-<br/>
hood, up to the present time, so much <br/>
so, that it has seemed as though some<br/>
invisible power or fate was watching<br/>
my footsteps, in order to find some<br/>
opportunity to take my life from the<br/>
earth. I can only attribute the con-<br/>
tinuation of my life to the present<br/>
time to a merciful God, whose hand <br/>
has been stretched out, and rescued<br/>
me from death in the midst of the <br/>
many dangers and hairbreadth escapes <br/>
I have passed through, some of which <br/>
I will here mention.</p>

<br/>
<p>When three years of age, I fell into<br/>
a caldron of boiling water, was in-<br/>
stantly caught out, but was so badly <br/>
scalded, that it was nine months be-<br/>
fore I was considered out of danger.</p>

<br/>
<p>At five years of age, I fell from the <br/>
great beam of a barn, striking my face <br/>
upon the floor, which came near <br/>
breaking my neck.</p>

<br/>
<p>Three months afterwards, I broke <br/>
one of my arms, by falling down<br/>
stairs. I soon after broke my other<br/>
arm, by falling out of a high stoop <br/>
upon a pile of timber.</p>

<br/>
<p>When six years of age, I came near<br/>
being killed by a surly bull. My <br/>
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and I were feeding pumpkins<br/>
to the cattle, a surly bull drove my <br/>
cow away from the one she was eating. <br/>
I took the pumpkin he had left, upon <br/>
which he pitched at me. My father <br/>
told me to throw down the pumpkin<br/>
and run. I ran down a steep hill, <br/>
and took the pumpkin with me, being <br/>
determined that the cow should have<br/>
her rights. The bull pursued. As <br/>
he was about to overtake me, I step-<br/>
ped into a post hole and fell; the bull <br/>
leaped over me, after the pumpkin, <br/>
and tore it to pieces with his horns,</p>

",
263.0,35,,"<p></p><p>and would have served me in the same <br/>
way, had I not fallen.</p>

<br/>
<p>During the same year, I went into<br/>
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] saw mill, with several <br/>
others. I got upon the head-block to<br/>
take a ride, while the carriage was<br/>
running back, not anticipating any <br/>
danger; my leg was caught between <br/>
the head-block and the fender-post, <br/>
and broke both bones of my leg below<br/>
the knee. I was taken to the house, <br/>
and lay nine hours before my bones <br/>
were set, suffering severe pain; but <br/>
being young, my bones soon knit <br/>
together, and I was upon my feet <br/>
again. During my confinement by <br/>
this lameness, my brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]]<br/>
was also confined in the same room<br/>
with the typhus fever.</p>

<br/>
<p>When seven years of age, I was <br/>
riding on the top of a load of hay, <br/>
which my uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozan Woodruff]], was<br/>
driving to the barn; he turned the <br/>
load over upon me; I was nearly<br/>
suffocated for the want of air, before <br/>
the hay was removed.</p>

<br/>
<p>At eight years old, I was riding in<br/>
a one-horse wagon with several others,<br/>
the horse took fright, ran down a<br/>
steep hill, and turned the wagon over<br/>
upon us; but again, while in the <br/>
midst of danger, my life was preserved;<br/>
none of us were seriously injured.</p>

<br/>
<p>When nine years old, I climbed into <br/>
an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped<br/>
upon a dry limb, which broke, and I <br/>
fell about fifteen feet upon my back, <br/>
which beat the breath out of my body. <br/>
A cousin ran and told my parents I <br/>
was dead. Before they arrived at the <br/>
spot, I came to my senses, and met<br/>
them.</p>

<br/>
<p>When twelve years of age, I was <br/>
drowned in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]], and<br/>
sunk in 30 feet of water, and after <br/>
carrying one person to the bottom <br/>
with me, I was miraculously saved by <br/>
a young man named [[John Bacon|Bacon]] diving to<br/>
the bottom, and carrying with him a <br/>
large stone, to hold him down until he<br/>
obtained my body, not expecting to <br/>
save me alive. I suffered much in <br/>
being restored to life.</p>

WILFORD WOODRUFF.<br/>
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-</p>

<br/>
<p>CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.<br/>
(Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], Feb. 1858.)</p>

<br/>
<p>At thirteen years of age, while <br/>
passing through [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] meadows,<br/>
in the depth of winter, the roads were<br/>
drifted with snow; and in an ex-<br/>
ceedingly blustering day, I became so <br/>
chilled and overcome with cold, that<br/>
I could not travel. I crawled into<br/>
the hollow of a large apple tree. A<br/>
man in the distance seeing me go in, <br/>
hastened to my rescue, realizing my<br/>
danger more fully than I did. When<br/>
he arrived at the spot, I had fallen<br/>
asleep, and was nearly insensible; he<br/>
had much difficulty in arousing me to<br/>
a sense of my situation. He procured<br/>
means to carry me to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]]<br/>
house, and through a kind Providence,<br/>
my life was again preserved.</p>

<br/>
<p>At fourteen years of age, I split my <br/>
left instep open with an ax, which <br/>
went nearly through my foot; it was <br/>
nine months getting well.</p>

<br/>
<p>At fifteen years of age, I was bitten<br/>
in my left hand by a mad dog in the<br/>
last stage of hydrophobia. He dented <br/>
my hand with his teeth, but did not<br/>
draw blood, and I was again pre-<br/>
served, through the mercies of God, <br/>
from an awful death.</p>

<br/>
<p>At the age of seventeen, I was riding <br/>
a very ill-tempered horse that I was <br/>
not acquainted with; and while going <br/>
down a very steep rocky hill, the <br/>
horse taking advantage of the ground, <br/>
suddenly leaped from the road, and<br/>
ran down the steep, amid the rocks, <br/>
at full speed, and commenced kicking <br/>
up, and attempted to throw me over<br/>
his head upon the rocks; but I lodged <br/>
upon the top of his head, grasped<br/>
hold of each ear as with a death grip, <br/>
expecting every moment to be dashed <br/>
to pieces against the rocks. While in<br/>
this position, sitting astride of his <br/>
neck, with no bridle to guide him but<br/>
his ears, he plunged down the hill <br/>
under full speed, until he ran against<br/>
a rock, and was dashed to the ground.</p>

",
263.0,37,1842-07-23,"<p></p><p>I went over both his head and the <br/>
rocks, about one rod, and struck the <br/>
ground square on my feet, being the<br/>
only thing visible that saved my life; <br/>
for, had I struck upon any other part <br/>
of my body, it must have killed me<br/>
instantly; as it was, my bones crushed<br/>
from under me as though they were <br/>
reeds. It broke my left leg in two <br/>
places, and put out both my ankles in<br/>
a shocking manner, and the horse <br/>
came near rolling over me in his strug-<br/>
gles to get up. My uncle, [[Titus Woodruff|Titus <br/>
Woodruff]], saw me fall, got assistance, <br/>
and carried me to his house. I lay<br/>
from 2 p.m. till 10, without medical <br/>
aid; then my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] arrived, bringing <br/>
Dr. Swift, of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], with him,<br/>
who set my bones, boxed up my <br/>
limbs, and carried me in his carriage <br/>
eight miles that night to my father's. <br/>
My sufferings were very great. I had <br/>
good attention, however, and in eight<br/>
weeks I was out-doors upon my <br/>
crutches.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1827, while attempting to clear <br/>
the ice out of a water-wheel, standing<br/>
upon the wheel with one arm around <br/>
the shaft, a man hoisted the gate, and<br/>
let a full head of water upon it. As <br/>
soon as the water struck the wheel it <br/>
started, my feet slipped into the <br/>
wheel, but I immediately plunged <br/>
head foremost over the rim into about <br/>
three feet of water, and my weight<br/>
drew my legs out of the wheel, or I <br/>
should have been drawn under a <br/>
shaft and crushed to death.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1831, while having charge of the<br/>
flouring mill in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsville]], Connecti-<br/>
cut, I was standing inside of a breast <br/>
wheel, 20 feet in diameter, upon one <br/>
of the arms near the top, clearing out <br/>
the ice, when a full head of water was <br/>
let on to it. The wheel immediately<br/>
started; but I dropped my ax and<br/>
leaped through it to the bottom, by<br/>
the shaft and arms, about twenty feet;<br/>
as I struck the bottom of the wheel, <br/>
I was rolled out against a ragged stone <br/>
wall, with only about two feet clear-<br/>
ance between it and the wheel. The <br/>
wheel caught me and rolled me out<br/>
into the water below, where I found<br/>
myself without any bones broken, but<br/>
with some bruises and much fright.</p>

<br/>
<p>During the winter of 1831, while in <br/>
[[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]], Ct., I passed through<br/>
a severe course of lung fever.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1833, the day I was baptized, <br/>
one of my horses, newly sharp shod, <br/>
kicked my hat off my head, and had<br/>
he struck two inches lower, would<br/>
probably have killed me instantly. In<br/>
ten minutes afterwards, while driving<br/>
the same team down a hill, on a sleigh <br/>
without any box, the bottom boards <br/>
slipped forward under the roller and <br/>
caught the ground, turned endwise, <br/>
and fell on the horses' backs, throw-<br/>
ing me between the horses; they ran<br/>
to the bottom of the hill, dragging me <br/>
with the lines, head foremost, with<br/>
the sleigh on top of me, about twenty <br/>
rods over a smooth snow path; I es-<br/>
caped unharmed, however, in the<br/>
midst of both dangers.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1834, while travelling in [[Zion|Zion's <br/>
Camp]] in [[Missouri|Missouri]], a rifle was acci-<br/>
dentally discharged, and the ball <br/>
passed through three tents, with about<br/>
twelve men in each, and lodged in a <br/>
wagon axle-tree, while a man was<br/>
standing behind it, and injured no <br/>
one. It passed within a few inches<br/>
of my breast, and many others es-<br/>
caped as narrowly as myself.</p>

<br/>
<p>A few months afterwards a musket, <br/>
heavily loaded with buckshot, was <br/>
accidentally snapped within a few feet <br/>
of me, with the muzzle pointed at my <br/>
breast; it had a good flint and was <br/>
well primed, but it missed fire, and <br/>
my life was again preserved.</p>

<br/>
<p>In April 1839, in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]], Illinois, <br/>
I was riding upon the running gears <br/>
of a wagon without a box, sitting upon<br/>
the forward axle-tree, when the bolt, <br/>
fastening the coupling pole, came out, <br/>
which left the hind wheels; and my <br/>
weight on the forward bolster and <br/>
tongue, turned the coupling pole over<br/>
on to the horses, turning the stakes <br/>
upside down, and shut me up fast be-<br/>
tween the bolster and tongue, but in <br/>
such a manner that my head and <br/>
shoulders dragged on the ground; <br/>
my horses took fright, and ran out <br/>
into an open prairie, and dragged me<br/>
in this position for about half a mile. <br/>
I managed to guide them with my<br/>
left hand, so as to run them into a <br/>
corner of a high worm fence, where <br/>
we landed in a pile together. I was <br/>
considerably bruised, but escaped <br/>
without any broken bones.</p>

OF<br/>
WILFORD WOODRUFF.<br/>
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-</p>

<br/>
<p>CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.<br/>
(Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], Feb. 1858.)</p>

<br/>
<p>On the <time datetime=""",10/05/1846
263.0,39,,""">5th of October, 1846</time>, while<br/>
with the camp of Israel building up <br/>
[[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|winter Quarters]], on the west side of <br/>
the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri river]], (then Indian <br/>
country) I passed through one of the<br/>
most painful and serious misfortunes<br/>
of my life. I took my axe and went<br/>
two and a half miles on to the bluffs to<br/>
cut some shingle timber to cover my <br/>
cabin; I was accompanied by two men. <br/>
While the third tree was falling, which <br/>
was an oak, over two feet in diameter,<br/>
I stepped behind it some ten feet, and<br/>
also to one side the same distance, <br/>
where I thought I would be entirely <br/>
out of danger; but when the tree fell,<br/>
there being a crook in the body of it,<br/>
which struck a knoll on the ground, <br/>
the whole body shot endways back of <br/>
the stump and bounded, and the butt<br/>
of the tree struck me on the breast<br/>
and knocked me several feet into the<br/>
air against a standing oak, and the <br/>
falling tree followed me in its bound<br/>
and caught me against the standing<br/>
tree, and I came down between them;<br/>
before reaching the earth, however, <br/>
I was liberated from them, and struck <br/>
the ground upon my feet in a badly<br/>
bruised condition. My left thigh, the <br/>
whole length of it, and my hip and<br/>
left arm were much bruised; my <br/>
breast bone and three ribs on my left <br/>
side were broken; my lungs, vitals and <br/>
left side were also bruised in a <br/>
shocking manner. After the accident<br/>
I sat upon a log until Mr. [[John Garrison|John<br/>
Garrison]] went a quarter of a mile to<br/>
get my horse. Notwithstanding I was <br/>
so badly hurt, I mounted my horse, <br/>
and rode two and a half miles over a <br/>
very rough road, dismounting twice in <br/>
consequence of miry places, my breast<br/>
and vitals were so badly torn to pieces, <br/>
that at each step of the horse the pain<br/>
went through me like an arrow. I con-<br/>
tinued on horseback until I arrived at <br/>
[[Turkey Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turkey creek]], on the north side of <br/>
Winter Quarters. I then became<br/>
exhausted, and was taken off my horse</p>

",
263.0,40,1848-07-05,"<p></p><p>and carried to my wagon in a chair. <br/>
I was met in the street by Presidents <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] and<br/>
[[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] and others, who assisted<br/>
in carrying me to my family. Before<br/>
laying me upon my bed, the Presidency <br/>
[[laying on of hands|laid hands]] upon me, rebuked my suffering <br/>
and distress in the name of the Lord, and <br/>
said I should live and not die. I was<br/>
then laid upon my bed in my wagon,<br/>
and as the Apostles prophesied upon<br/>
my head, so it came to pass. I <br/>
employed no physician on this occasion, <br/>
but was administered to by the Elders <br/>
of Israel and nursed by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]. I <br/>
lay upon my bed unable to move until<br/>
my breast bone began to knit together, <br/>
which commenced on the ninth day. <br/>
I began to walk about in twenty days; in <br/>
thirty days from the time I was hurt<br/>
I again commenced to do hard labor.</p>

<br/>
<p><time datetime=""",07/05/1848
263.0,40,1856-04-21,""">July 5th, 1848</time>—While on a mission<br/>
to the Eastern States, I drove my<br/>
carriage, containing myself and family <br/>
into the dooryard of brother [[James Williams|James<br/>
Williams]] in [[Iowa|Iowa]], to camp for the<br/>
night. I tied my mules to a large oak <br/>
tree several rods from the carriage. <br/>
As we were about to lay down in the<br/>
carriage for the night, I was strongly<br/>
impressed to go and move my mules<br/>
from the oak tree, and also to move<br/>
my carriage. I followed the dictates<br/>
of the spirit, and removed my mules to<br/>
a small hickory grove, also moved my<br/>
carriage several rods, and retired to <br/>
rest. In a short time a heavy rainstorm <br/>
came on, which broke the tree near the <br/>
ground, and laid it prostrate where my <br/>
carriage had stood. As it was, the top <br/>
struck the hind end of the carriage; <br/>
the tree was two feet in diameter. <br/>
Thus, by obeying the whisperings of <br/>
the Spirit, myself and family were<br/>
preserved.</p>

<br/>
<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/21/1856
263.0,40,1856-04-28,""">21st day of April, 1856</time>, <br/>
while assisting to remove an ox that<br/>
had died from poison and had been<br/>
skinned, I inoculated my arm with<br/>
poison and mortification ensued. The<br/>
poison worked through my system for <br/>
seven days before it showed itself out-<br/>
wardly. On the <time datetime=""",04/28/1856
263.0,40,1856-04-29,""">28th</time> my arm began <br/>
to swell, was in great pain and showed<br/>
signs of mortification. I showed it to <br/>
President Young, who advised me to <br/>
cleanse my stomach immediately, and <br/>
put on onion poultices, and anything<br/>
that would draw the poison from my <br/>
system into my arm, which counsel I <br/>
immediately put in execution. The <br/>
<time datetime=""",04/29/1856
263.0,40,,""">29th</time> was another trying day to my<br/>
life; the poison had so thoroughly <br/>
penetrated my whole system, that my <br/>
strength left me; I could not stand, I <br/>
was led to my bed, my bowels and <br/>
stomach ceased to act, my speech was <br/>
like that of a drunken man. President<br/>
Young called, in company with [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Dr. <br/>
Sprague]], and [[laying on of hands|laid hands]] upon me, and<br/>
rebuked the disease and the power of<br/>
the destroyer which had seized my <br/>
body, and promised me in the name of<br/>
the Lord, that I should not die but live <br/>
to finish my work which was appointed<br/>
me upon the earth. I soon began to re-<br/>
cover. The poison and mortification left <br/>
my system and centered in my arm, and <br/>
was drawn from my arm through the aid<br/>
of charcoal poultices, moistened with <br/>
a strong decoction of wormwood, <br/>
ragweed and wild sage; the dead flesh<br/>
was removed from my arm with<br/>
instruments and lunar caustic, and in<br/>
a few days I was well again.</p>

<br/>
<p>I have occupied considerable space <br/>
in referring to those peculiar circum-<br/>
stances which have attended me <br/>
during life, and to sum the matter up<br/>
it stands thus:—I have broken both <br/>
legs—one in two places—both arms, <br/>
my breast bone and three ribs, and <br/>
had both ankles dislocated. I have <br/>
been drowned, frozen, scalded and bit<br/>
by a mad dog—have been in two water <br/>
wheels under full head of water—have <br/>
passed through several severe fits of <br/>
sickness, and encountered poison in its <br/>
worst forms—have landed in a pile of <br/>
railroad ruins—have barely been<br/>
missed by the passing bullets, and<br/>
have passed through a score of other <br/>
hair-breadth escapes.</p>

<br/>
<p>It has appeared miraculous to me, <br/>
that with all the injuries and broken<br/>
bones which I have had, I have not a<br/>
lame limb, but have been enabled to<br/>
endure the hardest labor, exposures <br/>
and journeys—have often walked forty, <br/>
fifty, and on one occasion, sixty miles<br/>
in a day. The protection and mercy <br/>
of God has been over me, and my life<br/>
thus far has been preserved; for which <br/>
blessings I feel to render the gratitude<br/>
of my heart to my [[Heavenly Father|Heavenly Father]], <br/>
praying that the remainder of my days<br/>
may be spent in His service and in the <br/>
building up of his kingdom.</p>

<p>PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S [[BIRTHDAY|BIRTHDAY]].</p>

<p>BIOGRAPHICAL.</p>

<p>On Sunday, <time datetime=""",02/28/1897

day, <time datetime=""",03/01/1897
364.0,1,1807-03-01,""">March 1</time>, at 10 a.m., were exer-<br/>
cises in the Tabernacle in honor of the<br/>
ninetieth anniversary of the birth of<br/>
Elder Wilford Woodroff, President of<br/>
the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-<br/>
day Saints]], and one of the first com-<br/>

the valley of the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]].</p>

<p>For this occasion the Tabernacle<br/>
has been beautifully decorated.<br/>
The speakers' stands are ornamented<br/>
in white and old gold, with numerous<br/>
flowers and potted ferns and other<br/>
plants and around the organ. The<br/>
table at the foot of the stands is covered<br/>
with flowers, and in front of this seats<br/>
are raised above the floor for President<br/>
Woodruff and [[Emma Smith Woodruff|wife]] to occupy during<br/>
the reception on Monday. Over this<br/>
is a canopy draped with the Stars and<br/>
Stripes, with electric lights in the top<br/>
to throw light upon the couple. This<br/>
canopy will remain thrown back upon<br/>
the table until the time of the recep-<br/>
tion. The upper stand, which will be<br/>
occupied by the President and his<br/>
wife during the rendering of the pro-<br/>
gram, has been raised about sixteen <br/>
inches higher than its usual posi-<br/>
tion so that a full view can be <br/>
had of them from every part of the<br/>
building. In front of and near the top<br/>
of the organ is a beautiful star com-<br/>
posed of sixty-one electric lights; over<br/>
this and extending from south to<br/>
north across the building is a white<br/>
streamer bearing the inscriptions<br/>
""Glory be to God,"" ""Honor to His <br/>
Prophet,"" and the three dates, 1807,<br/>
1847, 1897. Around the gallery boot-<br/>
ing is stretched, with a star over each<br/>
post, and at the rear of the building is <br/>
the inscription, ""We honor the man<br/>
so honored of God."" Above the rear of <br/>
the gallery is a banner on which is <br/>
painted 1847-1897. Below this is a<br/>
Union flag which passed through the <br/>
war.</p>

<p>Herewith is a brief sketch of Presi-<br/>
dent Woodruff's long and eventful life,<br/>
furnished by himself:</p>

<p>I was born <time datetime=""",03/01/1807
364.0,1,1833-12-30,""">March 1, 1807</time>, at Northing-<br/>
ton, part of the [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] (now [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]]),<br/>
Hartford county, Connecticut. In<br/>
my early life I worked as a farmer<br/>
and miller. Of course my childhood<br/>
was passed under the influence of the <br/>
remnants of the [[Blue Laws|Blue Laws]] of Con-<br/>
neticut. I remember the day well <br/>
when the [[Baptist|Baptists]] and the [[Methodist|Methodists]]<br/>
in Connecticut were almost as un-<br/>
popular as the Mormons afterwards<br/>
became. [[Presbyterian|Presbyterians]] and [[Congregationalist|Congre-<br/>
gationalists]] were the ruling religions<br/>
of [[New England, United States|New England]] in my childhood.<br/>
In attending Sunday school in my<br/>
early boyhood, under Dr. [[Noah Porter|Noah Porter]],<br/>
and learning chapters of the [[Bible|Bible]]<br/>
by heart, I saw what Jesus Christ and <br/>
the Apostles taught. Those principles<br/>
were so firmly imprinted on my mind<br/>
that I could never join any church,<br/>
because the churches of that day did<br/>
not believe them, until I heard [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zara<br/>
Pulsipher]], a Mormon Elder, preach to<br/>
me and my brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], and a <br/>
large congregation of neighbors, at<br/>
[[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] (now [[Dansville, Livingston County, New York|Dansville]]), Oswego<br/>
county, New York, on the <time datetime=""",12/30/1833
364.0,1,1833-12-31,""">30th day of<br/>
December, 1833</time>. On hearing the first<br/>
sermon I and my brother Azmon were<br/>
convinced, and we went forth and</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
were baptized on the <time datetime=""",12/31/1833
364.0,1,1835-01-13,""">31st of Decem-<br/>
ber, 1833.</time></p>

<p>I went in [[Zion|Zion's camp]], in the spring<br/>
of 1835, to [[Missouri|Missouri]], to the assistance<br/>
of our people who had been driven<br/>
out of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson county]]. Very few of<br/>
the members of that Camp are living<br/>
today. That thousand miles' journey<br/>
with the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] was to<br/>
me a school of experience that I shall<br/>
never forget in this world or the world<br/>
to come. When the Prophet returned to<br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] with most of his company I<br/>
remained in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay county]], Missouri,<br/>
until the <time datetime=""",01/13/1835
364.0,1,1839-04-26,""">13th of January, 1835</time>, when<br/>
I left [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]]'s, in company<br/>
with [[Henry Brown|Henry Brown]], to go on a mission<br/>
to the Southern states. We passed<br/>
through Jackson county, Missouri, and<br/>
through [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], and from [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little<br/>
Rock]] to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis, Tennessee]]. I spent<br/>
two years in Tennessee and Ken-<br/>
tucky. While there I was ordained to the<br/>
office of an Elder under the hands of<br/>
[[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]], and afterwards a<br/>
member of the [[Second Quorum of the Seventy|Second quorum of the<br/>
Seventy]], under the hands of [[David Wyman Patten|David<br/>
W. Patten]]. I ordained [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] to<br/>
the office of an Elder in 1836, and he<br/>
traveled with me through Kentucky<br/>
and Tennessee, and accompanied me<br/>
to Kirtland in the fall of that year. I<br/>
organizd four branches of the Church<br/>
in Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>

<p>In 1837 I traveled through part of<br/>
[[Canada, British North America|Canada]], New York, [[Massachusetts|Massachusetts]],<br/>
Connecticut and [[Maine|Maine]] and [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox<br/>
Islands]]. During that mission I bap-<br/>
tized several hundred persons and<br/>
organized five branches of the Church<br/>
in Connecticut, Maine, and Fox Is-<br/>
lands. In January, 1837, I was ap-<br/>
pointed to the [[First Quorum of the Seventy|First quorum of Seven-<br/>
ties]].</p>

<p>In 1838 I traveled on three islands of<br/>
the sea and in twelve states of the<br/>
Union, established three preaching<br/>
places and organized one branch of<br/>
the Church in Farmington, Conn.,<br/>
with nine of my relatives, including<br/>
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/26/1839
364.0,1,1844-12-07,""">26th of April 1839</time>, myself<br/>
and [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] were ordained<br/>
to the Apostleship, on the Temple [[cornerstone|cor-<br/>
ner]] at [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], Missouri. The same<br/>
year I crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic ocean]] in<br/>
company with [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], to [[England|Eng-<br/>
land]], spending the next year there with<br/>
the [[Twelve Apostles|Twelve Apostles]]. First I went<br/>
to [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]] and organized three<br/>
branches. Then I went to [[Herefordshire, England|Hereford-<br/>
shire]], [[Worcestershire, England|Worcestershire]] and [[Gloucestershire, England|Gloucester-<br/>
shire]], where, in eight months, I<br/>
brought 1,800 souls into the Church,<br/>
including 600 of the [[United Brethren|United Brethren]],<br/>
who had broken off from the Wes-<br/>
leyan Methodists, with forty-five<br/>
preachers, baptizing all of that sect<br/>
but one member. I established three<br/>
conferences and fifty-eight preaching<br/>
places, and organized forty-seven<br/>
branches of the Church.</p>

<p>I then went to [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] with [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
C. Kimball]] and George A. Smith.<br/>
We organized the first branch of the<br/>
Church in that city, consisting of<br/>
eighty-five members.</p>

<p>In 1841, I traveled over 7,000 miles<br/>
through England, [[Wales|Wales]] and parts of<br/>
the United States, with the Twelve<br/>
Apostles, to attend to the affairs of the<br/>
Church.</p>

<p>I spent most of 1842-3 in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], at-<br/>
tending to the printing office and other<br/>
business. An important year was 1844,<br/>
in which the Prophet Joseph Smith and<br/>
his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were [[martyrdom|killed]]. That</p>

<p>[Column 3]<br/>
year I traveled over 10,000 miles in<br/>
Canada and the United States, visit<br/>
ing the churches, attending meetings,<br/>
etc. In the fall of the year I was ap-<br/>
pointed to go to England to pre-<br/>
side over the British mission, setting<br/>
sail at [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] <time datetime=""",12/07/1844

to their summer ranges to break up<br/>
into smaller herds to feed in the Platte<br/>
country. They were so numerous that<br/>
we could scarcely |find| our way through <br/>

three generation. <s>I learn from the English Book of Heraldry that</s></p>

<p><s>Woodruff supposed to be one of my Ancestors was Lord Mayor</s><br/>

<p>Variant &amp; divers are the lives &amp; fortunes of man in every age of the world. While the<br/>
path of some are strewn with flowers &amp; ease from the cradle to the graves with<br/>
naught to disturb their peace others apparently are marked victims of variated<br/>
misfortune accidents &amp; dangers. The last named class is the one in whose ranks<br/>
I have stood through my infancy childhood youth &amp; manhood up to the present<br/>
time so much so that it has seemed as though some invisible power or fate was</p>",
370.0,3,,"<p>watching my footsteps in order to find some opportunity to take my life from<br/>
the Earth <s>but</s> I can ownly attribute the continuation of my life on Earth<br/>
to the present time to a merciful God whose hand has been streched out &amp; rescued<br/>
me from death in the midst of the many dangers and hair breadths escapes which I <br/>
have passed through <s>in life</s> some of which I will here mention</p>

<p>When three years of age I fell into a caldron of boiling water was instantly caught out<br/>
&amp; so badly scalded that is was 9 months before I was considered out of danger. When<br/>
five years of age I fell from the great beam of a barn upon my face upon the <s>beam</s> floor<br/>
which came near breaking my neck three months afterwards I broke one of my<br/>
arms falling down a pair of stairs.  I soon broke the other arm falling out of <br/>
a high stoop across some timber. When six years of age I came near being killed<br/>
by a surly bull and was ownly saved as it were by a miracle. During the same year<br/>
I went into my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] saw mill with several other children I got upon the head block<br/>
to take a ride while running the carriage back not anticipating any danger but before<br/>
I was aware of it my leg was caught between the head block &amp; fender post &amp; broak<br/>
both bones in two below the knee I was taken to the house &amp; lay 9 hours before my<br/>
bones was set which time was spent amid severe pain: but being young my bones<br/>
soon nit together &amp; in few weeks I was again upon my feet <s>attending to the sports of</s><br/>
<s>my youth</s>. During my confinement with this lameness my brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] was my<br/>
companion in the same room going through with a course of the typus fever<br/>
When 7 years of age I was riding on the top of a load of hay which my Uncle<br/>
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]] was driving to the barn when he turned the load over on top of <br/>
me and <s>before it was</s> I was nearly strangled for the want of air before it was removed<br/>
<s>from me</s>. While 8 years of age I was riding in a one horse waggon with <br/>
several others <s>to go to our labor</s> the horse took fright ran down a steep hill and <br/>
turned us over with the waggon on top of us. But again while in the midst of danger<br/>
my life was preserved none of us was seriously injured. While 9 years of age I <s>clumb</s> ^climbed^<br/>
into an Elim tree to obtain some bark. I steped upon a dry <s>tree</s> limb and I fell<br/>
about 15 feet upon my back which <s>apparently</s> beat the breath out of my body a cousin<br/>
ran &amp; told my parents I was dead, before they arrived at the spot I came to my senses<br/>
<s>arose upon my feet</s> &amp; met my Parents coming to me. At 12 years of age I<br/>
was drowned in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington River]] &amp; sunk in 30 feet of water and was miraculously<br/>
saved by a young man named Bacon, I suffered much in being restored to life<br/>
At 13 years of age while passing through Farmington meadows in the depth of <br/>
winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an exceeding blustering day I <s>became</s></p>",
370.0,4,,"<p>Became so chilled &amp; overcome with cold I could not travel, I crawled into the<br/>
hollow of a large tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into it<br/>
hastened to my ^rescue^ realizeing more fully than I did the danger I was in when he arrived<br/>
at the spot I had fallen asleep &amp; was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in<br/>
arousing me to a sens of my situation. He procured means to convey me to my<br/>
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] house and through a kind profidence my life was again preserved</p>

<p>At 14 years of age I split my left instep open with an ax which went nearly <br/>
through my foot &amp; ^it^ was 9 months getting well. At 15 years of age I was bitten in <br/>
my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of the Hydrophobia. He ownly clamped<br/>
my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood and I was preserved through<br/>
the mercy of God from an awful death. At the age of 17 I met with an accident<br/>
which caused me much suffering &amp; came near ending my life. I was riding a very<br/>
ill tempered horse which I was not acquainted with, and while going down a very steep<br/>
rocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground suddenly leaped from the road &amp; ran<br/>
down the steepest part of the hill amid the thicket &amp; the rocks at full speed and he commenced<br/>
kicking up at the same time &amp; about landing me over his head among the rocks but I lodged<br/>
on the top of his head grasped one hand hold of each ear as with a death grasp expecting evry<br/>
moment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks while in this position sitting astride his neck<br/>
with no bridle to guide him but his ears he plunged down the hill <s>among the rocks</s> with all<br/>
<s>force</s> ^speed^ untill he ran against a rock which dashed him to the Earth I went over his head<br/>
&amp; the rock about one rod &amp; struck the ground square upon my being the ownly thing<br/>
visible that saved my life, for had ^I^ struck upon any othe part of my body it must have <br/>
killed me instantly, as it was my <s>boenes</s> bones crushed from under me as though they<br/>
were reeds. It broke my left leg twice in two &amp; put out both of my ancles in a <br/>
shocking manner, and the horse came nigh rolling over me in his struggles to<br/>
get up. ^My uncle [[Titus Woodruff|Titus Woodruff]] saw^ <s>An uncle of mine saw</s> me fall, <s>hastened to my relief</s> got amist me &amp;<br/>
&amp; carried me to his house <s>in an arm chair</s>, I lay from 2 oclok till 10 at night<br/>
without ^medical aid^ <s>assistance</s> then my Father arrived bringing Dr <strike>T</strike> [[Dr. Swift|Swift]] of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] with him<br/>
who set my bones boxed up my limbs &amp; carried me in his carriage 8 miles that <br/>
night to my Fathers <s>house</s> my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention<br/>
&amp; in 8 weeks I was outdoors upon my cruches <s>&amp; soon was all well again</s><br/>
In 1827 while <s>attending the Flouring Mill</s> attempting to clear the ice out of a water<br/>
wheel standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft a man hoisted the gate<br/>
let a full head of water upon it as soon as the water struck it it stopped my feet<br/>
sliped into [word covered] I immediately plunged head fore most over the rim of the </p>",
370.0,5,,"<p>wheel into about 3 feet of water and my weight drew my legs<br/>
out of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft &amp; crushed <br/>
to death. In 1831, while having charge of the Flouring Mill in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collins<s>v</s>-<br/>
ville]] Ct I was standing inside of a breast wheel 20 feet in diameter<br/>
upon one of the arms near the top clearing out the ice when a full head of <br/>
water was let onto it it immediately started. I dropped my ax and leaped<br/>
through the wheel to the bottom of it by the shaft &amp; arms about 20 feet as I struck<br/>
the bottom of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone well with ownly <br/>
about 2 feet clearance between it &amp; the wheel the wheel caught me &amp; rolled ^me^ out<br/>
into the water below where I found myself without any broken bones but with<br/>
some bruises &amp; much fright. ^*see paper apart^ In 1833 the day I was baptized into the<br/>
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints one of my horses newly calked<br/>
kicked my hat of my head &amp; had he struck 2 inches lower would probably <br/>
have killed me instantly. In 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same horses<br/>
down a hill on a sled without any box the bottom boards sliped forward<br/>
under the roll caught the ground turned endways fell on the horses badly<br/>
throwing me between the horses they ran to the bottom of the hill draging me<br/>
by the lines head foremost with the steed top of me about rods over<br/>
a smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangers<br/>
In 1834, while travelling in [[Zion|Zions Camp]] to [[Missouri|Missouri]] a rifle was accidentally<br/>
discharged &amp; the ball passed through three tents with a dozen men in each &amp; lodged<br/>
in a waggon axletree with a man standing against it it injured no one. It passed within<br/>
a few inches of my breast &amp; many others escaped as narrowly as my self</p>

<p>A few months afterwards a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing at<br/>
my breast within a few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot but it missed fire<br/>
and my life was again preserved.  In April 1839 in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] Ill I was riding<br/>
upon the running gears of a waggon without any box, I was sitting upon the fore ward<br/>
axletree and the bolt came out fastening the cupling pole this left the hind wheels &amp; my<br/>
weight on the forward bolster &amp; tongue turned the coupling pole clear over onto the horses<br/>
backs, turned the stakes upside down &amp; shut me up fast between the boulster &amp; tongue<br/>
but in such a manner that my head &amp; shoulders dragged on the ground my horses<br/>
took fright and ran out into an open <s>pari</s> prairie &amp; thus draged me in this position<br/>
for about half a mile when I managed <s>so as</s> to guide them with my left hand so <br/>
as to to run them into a corner of a high worm fence where we landed in a pile<br/>
together, I was considerably bruised but <s>landed withou</s> escaped without any broken bones</p>",
370.0,6,,"<p>see paper apart*<br/>
<s>&amp; after one days rest was enabled to attend to my labors again</s> <s><u>(see paper apart)</u></s><br/>
<s>Thes</s> I have occupied considerable space in refering to those peculiar circumstances<br/>

At an early age my mind <s>began to be</s> ^was^ exercised upon religious subjects. But<br/>
I never made a profession of religion untill 1830, <s>being 23 years of age</s> I did not then <br/>

<s>in there day &amp; generation</s> <s>for the salvation of the children of Man</s> Although the <br/>
teachers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles, &amp; ordinances which <br/>
the prophets, <s>Savior &amp;</s> the Apostles enjoyed were done away &amp; no longer needed I did <br/>
not believe a word of it to be true ownly as they were done away through the unbeliefs<br/>
of the children of men I believed the same gifts graces miracles &amp; power would be <br/>
manifest the same in one age of the world as in another when God did have a Church <br/>
&amp; kingdom upon the Earth, I did not believe that the [[Church of Christ|Church of Christ]] did exist <br/>
upon the Earth in an organized form, but I believed there had been a falling away<br/>
from the Apostolic order <s>of things</s>,  but that the Church &amp; kingdom of God would be<br/>
esstablished upon the Earth in my day <s>&amp; generation</s> and that I should live to see it. <br/>
This principle was rivited upon my mind from two causes 1<sup><u>st</u></sup> from the perusal of the <br/>
Old &amp; New Testament with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me what was <br/>
right &amp; wrong &amp; lead me in the path of salvation, without any regard to the opinions of man<br/>
&amp; the whisperings of the spirit of the Lord unto me for the space of three years <s>did teach</s> ^taught^<br/>
me in accordance with the ^written^ word of God that He was about to set up his Church &amp; Kingdom <br/>
upon the Earth in the last days ^and that his ""righteousness was about to be revealed &amp; his salvation to come forth""^ ^<s>as said the Prophet [[Isaiah (OT)|Isaiah]] in his 56 chapter</s>^ And secondly I was taught this principle from my youth<br/>
<s>up<s> </s>to manhood</s> by an aged man by the name of [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]] who lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]] <br/>
Ct who was frequently called the old prophet Mason, ^who taught^ <s>who did teach</s> me many things <br/>
which are now coming to pass. <s>He prophesied of many of those events which are now take</s><br/>
<s>place.</s> He did not believe that any man upon the Earth <s>in the midst of the Christian Nations</s></p>",
370.0,7,1833-12-29,"<p>^Had authority^ to administer in the ordinances of the [[House of the Lord|House of the Lord]] but believed that it was our<br/>

I was living in this state of mind <s>&amp; in this faith &amp; belief</s> looking for the coming forth of<br/>

&amp; wondered what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island, but as we had made preparations <br/>
to move to the west we let outward circumstances controll us, and like Jonah instead of going to <br/>
Ninivah went to Tarshis, so we instead of going to Rhode Island went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] Oswego County<br/>
N. York, and there remained until the <time datetime=""",12/29/1833

WILFORD WOODRUFF.<br/>
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-</p>

<br/>
<p>In tracing the history of my fathers, <br/>
I find it difficult to obtain a satis-<br/>
factory account of the Woodruff family<br/>
for more than three generations.</p>

<br/>
<p>My great grandfather, [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Wood-<br/>

and possessed an iron constitution,<br/>
and performed a great amount of <br/>
manual labor nearly up to the time of<br/>
his death. His wife's name was [[Sarah Woodford Woodruff|Sarah]];<br/>
she bore to him nine children, as <br/>
follows: -- [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1743|Josiah]], [[Appleton Woodruff|Appleton]], [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad]],<br/>
[[Elisha Woodruff|Elisha]], [[Joseph Woodruff, b. 1752|Joseph]], [[Obedience Woodruff Fuller|Rhoda]], [[Phebe Woodruff, b. 1758|Phebe]], and <br/>
two names not given.</p>

<br/>
<p>My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff,<br/>
was the third son of Josiah. He was<br/>
born in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Hartford co.,<br/>
Connecticut, in 1751; he also posses-<br/>
sed a strong constitution. It was <br/>
said that he performed the most labor<br/>
for several years of any man in Hart-<br/>
ford county, and from over exertion <br/>
in hewing timber, he was attacked<br/>
with rheumatism in his right hip,<br/>
which caused severe lameness for<br/>
several years before his death. He<br/>
married [[Dinah Woodford Woodruff|Dinah Woodford]], by whom he <br/>
had seven children--viz., [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1773|Eldad]], [[Elizabeth Woodruff Frisbie|Eli-<br/>
zabeth]], [[Samuel G. Woodruff|Samuel]], [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek]], [[Titus Woodruff|Titus]], [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Helen]]<br/>
and [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]].</p>

<br/>
Eldad married [[Lewey Woodford Woodruff|Lewey Woodford]];<br/>
Elizabeth, [[Amasa Frisbie|Amasa Frisby]]; Samuel,<br/>
[[Nancy Case Woodruff|Miss Case]]; Aphek, [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Beulah Thompson]]<br/>

Ozem, [[Acksah Merrill Woodruff|Acksah Merrill]] and [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah<br/>
Hart]]; all of whom had large families.<br/>
My grandfather died in Farming-<br/>
ton, with the [[spotted fever|spotted fever]], in 1806,<br/>
aged 55 years. My grandmother, <br/>
Dinah, died in 1824, in the same place,<br/>
with a cancer in the left breast; her<br/>
sufferings were very great.<br/>
My father, Aphek Woodruff, was <br/>
born in Farmington, Nov. 11, 1778;<br/>
he married Beulah Thompson, who <br/>
was born in 1782, Nov. 29, 1801.<br/>
She bore three sons--namely, [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], <br/>
born Nov. 29, 1802; [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Ozen Thompson]],<br/>
born Dec. 22, 1804; myself born<br/>
March 1, 1807.<br/>
My mother died with the spotted <br/>
fever, June 11, 1808, aged 26 years,<br/>
leaving me fifteen months old. My<br/>
father's second wife, Azubah Hart, <br/>
was born July 31, 1792; they were<br/>
married Nov. 9, 1810; they had six<br/>
children--viz., [[Philo Woodruff|Philo]], born Nov. 29,<br/>
1811, and died by poison administered<br/>
by a physician Nov. 25, 1827; [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel<br/>

drowned Sept. 1820; [[Julius Woodruff|Julius]], born<br/>
April 22, 1820, and died in infancy;<br/>
[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]], born June 19, 1821. I <br/>
married her to [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]], in <br/>
Farmington, Conn., Aug. 4, 1841.<br/>
My father was a strong constitu-<br/>
tioned man, and has done a great <br/>
amount of labor. At eighteen years <br/>
of age he commenced attending a flour-",
263.0,2,,"<p></p><p>ing and saw mill, and continued about <br/>
50 years; most of this time he labored<br/>
eighteen hours a day.</p>

<br/>
<p>He never made any profession of<br/>
religion until I baptized him, with all<br/>
his household, into the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of <br/>
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], on <br/>
the first day of July 1838. He was a <br/>
man of great charity, honesty, inte-<br/>
grity and truth, and made himself poor<br/>
by giving to the poor, and accomoda-<br/>
ting his fellow-men by loaning money<br/>
and becoming surety for his neighbors,<br/>
and always saying yes to every man<br/>
who asked a favor at his hand.</p>

<br/>
<p>I was born in the north part of the <br/>
town of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], <br/>
Hartford co., Conn., March 1, 1807.<br/>
I assisted my father in attending the <br/>
Farmington Mills, until I was twenty<br/>
years of age.</p>

<br/>
<p>In April 1827, I took the flouring <br/>
mill of my aunt, [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Helen Wheeler]], <br/>
which I attended three years. In <br/>
May 1830, I took charge of the flour-<br/>
ing mill of Mr. [[Samuel Collins|Colllins]], the ax manu-<br/>
facturer, in [[South Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|South Canton]], Conn. At<br/>
the end of one year it was demolished<br/>
to make way for other machinery. <br/>
In March 1831, I took charge of the <br/>
flouring mill owned by Mr. [[Richard B. Cowles|Richard <br/>
B. Cowles]] of [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]], Conn. <br/>
In the spirng of 1832, in company <br/>
with my oldeset brother, [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], I <br/>
went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego co., New<br/>
York, and purchased a farm and saw<br/>
mill, and settled in business.</p>

 <br/>

has done a great amount of labor. At 18 years of age, he commenced<br/>

<br/>
<p>I was born in the North part of the town of<br/>
Farmington, now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], Hartford Co., Conn. March 1, 1807.<br/>
I assisted my Father in attending the Farmington Mills, until I<br/>
was 20 years of age. / In <strike>the Spring of</strike> ^April,^ 1827 I took the flouring<br/>
mill of my Aunt, [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen Wheeler]], which I attended three years.<br/>
In <strike>the Spring of </strike> ^May,^ 1830, I took charge of the flouring mill of Mr.<br/>
[[Samuel Collins|Collins]], the ax manufacturer, in [[South Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|south Canton]], Conn., at the end <br/>
of one year it was demolished to make way for other machinery.<br/>
In <strike>the spring</strike> <s>of</s> ^March,^ 1831 I took charge of the flouring mill owned<br/>
by Mr. [[Richard B. Cowles|Richd. B. Cowle<s>y</s>s]] of [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]], Conn. In <strike>the Sp^r^ing</strike> ^stet^<br/>
<s>of</s> ^stet^ 1832, in company with my oldest brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], I went to<br/>
[[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Owego Co., New York, and purchased a farm and saw mill,<br/>
and settled <strike>down</strike> in business <strike>for ourselves</strike>.</p>

<br/>
<p>At an early age my mind was exercised upon religious</p>

",
374.0,3,,"<p></p><p>subjects, although I never made a<strike>n</strike> ^<strike>outward</strike>^ profession until 1830; I did <br/>
not then join any church, for the reason that I could not find <br/>
any denomination whose doctrines, faith or practice, agreed with <br/>
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordinances and gifts which the <br/>
Apostles taught.  Although the ministers of the day taught that <br/>
the faith, gifts, graces, miracles ^&amp; ordinances,^ which the ancient saints enjoyed <br/>
were done away and no longer needed, I did not believe <strike>a word of</strike><br/>
it<s>,</s> to be true, only as they were done away through the unbelief of<br/>
the children of men; I believed the same gifts, graces, miracles and <br/>
power would be manifest in one age of the world as in another,<br/>
when God had a church upon the earth, &amp; <strike>I believed</strike> ^that^ the church <br/>
of God would be ^re-^established upon the earth, <strike>in my</strike> and that <br/>
I should live to see it.  Th<s>i</s>es^e^ principles w<s>as</s>^ere^ rivetted upon my <br/>
mind from <strike>two causes; first, from</strike> the perusal of the old and <br/>
new Testament, with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me <br/>
what was right and wrong, and lead me in the path of salva-<br/>
tion, without any regard to the opinions of man, and the <br/>
whisperings of the spirit of the Lord for the space of three years <br/>
taught me <strike>in accordance with the written word of God</strike> that <br/>
He was about to set up His church and kingdom upon the <br/>
earth in the last days. / <strike>and secondly,</strike> I was taught th<s>i</s>es^e^ <br/>
<strike>principle</strike> ^things^ from my youth by [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], an aged man,<br/>
who lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]], Conn.; who was frequently called the old <br/>
prophet Mason,: he taught me many things which are now<br/>
coming to pass. <s>/ he</s></p>

<br/>
<p>He did not believe that any <strike>person</strike> man <strike>upon the</strike><br/>
<strike>face of the earth</strike> had authority to administer in the ordinances<br/>
of the Gospel, but believed it was our privilege through faith, prayer <br/>
and fasting to heal the sick, and cast out Devils by the laying on <br/>
of hands, which was the case under his administration as many <br/>
could testify.</p>

<br/>
<p><strike>I was looking for the coming forth of the truth when I</strike><br/>
<strike>heard of what was called Mormonism</strike>.  In 1832 I was <br/>
inspired to go to [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]], <strike>an</strike> my brother, [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]], was<br/>
also directed by the spirit of God to go to the same place</p>

374.0,4,,"<p></p><p>when [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|we]] met, we both told our impressions, and it caused us <br/>
to <strike>wonder and</strike> marvel and wonder, what the Lord wanted of <br/>
us in [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]; but as we had made preparations <br/>
to move to the West, we let outward circumstances control us,<br/>
and Jonah-like, instead of going to Rhode Island, we went <br/>
to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego Co., New York, and there remained until <br/>
<strike>the</strike> <s>29th day of</s> Dec., ^29,^ 1833, <strike>before</strike> ^when^ I heard Elder [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsiper]] <br/>
and [[Elijah Cheney|Elijah Cheeny]] preach. My brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] and I believed <br/>
their testimony, <strike>and</strike> <s>invited</s> ^entertained^ the Elders <strike>home</strike> and offered our-<br/>
selves for baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the <br/>
book of Mormon and I received a testimony that it was <br/>
true.</p>

<br/>
<p><strike>I learned that Elders [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Sam. H. Smith]] and [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]</strike> <s>were</s><br/>
<s>had preached in Rhode island in 1832, which accounted for the</s><br/>
<s>reason</s> We soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode <br/>
Island, for at the time we were warned <strike>of the Lord</strike> to go there, <br/>
two of the Elders <s>of the Latter day Saints</s> were preaching there,<br/>
and had we gone, we <strike>certainly</strike> should have embraced the <br/>
work at that time, <strike>but</strike> <s>as it was</s> <s>we had to wait for</s><br/>
<s>the next call</s>.</p>

<br/>
<p>Dec. 31, I was baptized by Elder Zerah Pulsipher; <strike>and</strike> ^he^ <br/>
confirmed ^me^ the same evening.</p>

<p>Jan. 2, 1834 I was ordained <strike>to the office of</strike> a Teacher,<br/>
and my <strike>Eldest</strike> brother, Azmon, an Elder, and a small branch organized <br/>
of 12 members by Elder Pulsipher.</p>

 <br/>
<p>In Feby. following, in company with Elder Holton, I walked <br/>
some 60 miles to the town of [[Fabius, Onondaga County, New York|Fabius]] to attend an evening meeting <br/>
of the saints in that place where Elder Pulsipher was presiding; I <br/>
saw the book of commandments or revelations given through [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], <br/>
and I believed them with all my heart and rejoiced therein, and after <br/>
spending several days <strike>with them</strike>, and holding several meetings, we returned <br/>
home rejoicing. ¶ During the winter, we were visited by several of the <br/>
Elders <strike>among whom was Elder [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]]</strike>; <s>He</s> <s>again</s> <s>who called</s><br/>

<p>When I consider the surrounding circumstances<br/>
in which I am placed this day standing in the<br/>
open air with weak lungs and somewhat out of health<br/>
I feel that I must have the prayers and faith of my<br/>
brethren that God may strengthen me and pour out<br/>
his special blessings upon me if you get much<br/>
from me this day [FIGURE]</p>

<p>There are many people assembled<br/>
here and in this city from various parts of the world<br/>
who say that they have to a certainty received a portion<br/>
of Knowledge from God by revelation in the way<br/>
which He has ordained and pointed out. I shall<br/>
take the broad ground then that if we have or can</p>",
42658.0,9,,"<p>receive a portion of Knowledge from God by immediate revelation<br/>
by the same source we can receive all Knowledge</p>

<p>What shall I talk about to day? I know<br/>
what brother Cahoon wants <strike>about</strike> <strike>^me to the^</strike>. He wants me to speak<br/>
about the coming of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] in the Last days. I can see<br/>
it in his eye. I will speak upon that subject then</p>

<p>The Bible says I will send you Elijah<br/>
before the great and terrible day of the Lord come that he<br/>
shall turn the hearts of the <strike>children</strike> ^Fathers^ to the children and<br/>
the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and<br/>
smite the earth with a curse. Now the word ""turn""<br/>
here should be translated bind or seal.</p>

CHAPTER I.<br/>
FAMILY SKETCH. MY EARLY DAYS AND <br/>
MINISTRY.</p>

<p>In tracing the history of my fathers, I <br/>
find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory <br/>
account of the Woodruff family for more <br/>
than three generations.</p>

<p>My great grandfather, [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Woodruff]], <br/>
lived nearly one hundred years, and pos-<br/>
sessed an iron constitution, and per-<br/>
formed a great amount of manual labor <br/>
nearly up to the time of his death. His <br/>
wife's name was [[Sarah Woodford Woodruff|Sarah]]; she bore to him <br/>
nine children as follows:—[[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1743|Josiah]], [[Appleton Woodruff|Apple-<br/>
ton]], [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad]], [[Elisha Woodruff|Elisha]], [[Joseph Woodruff, b. 1752|Joseph]], [[Obedience Woodruff Fuller|Rhoda]], [[Phebe Woodruff, b. 1758|Phebe]], <br/>
and two names not given.</p>

<p>My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was <br/>
the third son of Josiah. He was born in <br/>
[[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Hartford County, Connecti-<br/>
cut, in 1751; he also possessed a strong <br/>
constitution; it was said that he per-<br/>
formed the most labor for several years <br/>
of any man in Hartford County, and <br/>
from over exertion in hewing timber he <br/>
was attacked with rheumatism in his right <br/>
hip, which caused severe lameness, for <br/>
several years before his death. He mar-<br/>
ried [[Dinah Woodford Woodruff|Dinah Woodford]], by whom he had <br/>
seven children, viz:—[[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1773|Eldad]], [[Elizabeth Woodruff Frisbie|Elizabeth]], <br/>
[[Samuel G. Woodruff|Samuel]], [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek]], [[Titus Woodruff|Titus]], [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen]], and [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]].</p>

<p>Eldad married [[Lewey Woodford Woodruff|Lewey Woodford]]; Eliz-<br/>
abeth, [[Amasa Frisbie|Amasa Frisby]]; Samuel, Miss [[Nancy Case Woodruff|Case]]; <br/>
Aphek, [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Beulah Thompson]] and [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Azubah <br/>
Hart]]; Titus, [[Louisa Alling Woodruff|Louisa Allen]]; Hellen, [[Amos Wheeler, b. 1779|Amos <br/>
Wheeler]]; and Ozem, [[Acksah Merrill Woodruff|Acksah Merrill]] and <br/>
[[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah Hart]]; all of whom had large <br/>
families.</p>

<p>My grandfather died in Farmington, <br/>
with the [[spotted fever|spotted fever]] in 1806, aged 55 <br/>
years. My grandmother, Dinah, died in <br/>
1824, in the same place, with a cancer in <br/>

great.</p>

<p>My father was a strong constitutioned <br/>

labor. At eighteen years of age, he com-<br/>
menced attending a flouring and saw mill, <br/>
and continued about 50 years; most of <br/>
this time he labored eighteen hours a day.</p>

<p>He never made any profession of re-<br/>
ligion, until I baptized him with all his <br/>
household into the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ <br/>
of Latter-day Saints]] on the <time datetime=""",07/01/1838

himself poor by giving to the poor, and <br/>

ing money and becoming surety for his <br/>
neighbors, and always saying yes, to every <br/>
man who asked a favor at his hand.</p>

<p>I was born in the north part of the <br/>
town of Farmington, now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], <br/>
Hartford County, Connecticut, <time datetime=""",03/01/1807

together their living relatives that they may be saved<br/>
also before the earth will be smitten and the condemnation<br/>
decreed falls upon the world</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] would advise all the Saints to go<br/>
to with all their might and gather together all their living<br/>
relations to this place that they may be sealed and <br/>
saved that they may be prepared against the day when<br/>
the Destroying Angel goes forth.</p>

<p>If the whole Church should go to<br/>
with all their might to save their dead, seal their<br/>
posterity and gather their living friends and spend<br/>
none of their time in behalf of the world they<br/>
would hardly get through when Night would come<br/>
when no man could work</p>

<p>My only trouble at the present<br/>
time is concerning ourselves—that the Saints will<br/>
be divided and broken up and scattered before we<br/>
get our salvation secure; for their are so many fools<br/>
in the world for the Devil to operate upon it gives<br/>
him the advantage of ten times</p>

<p>The question is frequently asked<br/>
can we not be saved without going through with<br/>
all these ordinances? I would answer no; not<br/>
with the fulness of salvation</p>

<p>Jesus said there were many<br/>
mansions in his Father's Kingdom and he would<br/>
go and prepare a place for them. (""House"" in the<br/>
text should have been translated Kingdom). Any<br/>
person who is exalted to the highest mansion has to<br/>
abide a celestial law and the whole law too; but<br/>
here has been a great diffuculty in getting anything<br/>
into the hearts of this generation. It has been</p>",
42658.0,11,1844-01-25,"<p>like splitting hemlock Knotts with a corn dogger [dodger] for a wedge<br/>
and a pumpkin for a beetle. Even the Saints are slow to <br/>
understand. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] have tried for a number of years to prepare<br/>
the minds of the Saints to receive the things of God; but<br/>
we frequently see some of them after suffering all ^that^ they have<br/>
for the work of God fly to pieces like glass as soon as anything<br/>
comes that is contrary to their traditions. They cant stand<br/>
the fire at all. How many will be able to abide a<br/>
celestial law and go through and recieve their exaltation<br/>
I am unable to say; but many are called and few<br/>
are chosen.""</p>

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
ing the [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Mills, until I was <br/>
twenty years of age.</p>

<p>In April, 1827, I took the flouring mill <br/>
of my aunt, [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen Wheeler]], which I at-<br/>
tended three years. In May, 1830, I took <br/>
charge of the flouring mill of Mr. [[Samuel Collins|Col-<br/>
lins]], the ax manufacturer, in [[South Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|South Can-<br/>
ton]], Connecticut. At the end of one <br/>
year it was demolished to make way for <br/>
other machinery. In March, 1831, I <br/>
took charge of the flouring mill owned <br/>
by Mr. [[Richard B. Cowles|Richard B. Cowles]], of [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hart-<br/>
ford]], Connecticut. In the spring of 1832, <br/>
in company with my oldest brother, <br/>
[[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], I went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego <br/>
County, New York, and purchased a farm <br/>
and saw mill, and settled in business.</p>

<p>At an early age my mind was exercised <br/>
upon religious subjects, although I never <br/>
made a profession until 1830. I did not <br/>
then join any church, for the reason that <br/>
I could not find any denomination whose <br/>
doctrines, faith or practice, agreed with <br/>
the gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordin-<br/>
ances and gifts which the Apostles taught. <br/>
Although the ministers of the day taught <br/>
that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles and <br/>
ordinances, which the ancient saints en-<br/>
joyed, were done away and no longer <br/>
needed, I did not believe it to be true, <br/>
only as they were done away through the <br/>
unbelief of the children of men. I be-<br/>
lieved the same gifts, graces, miracles <br/>
and power would be manifest in one age <br/>
of the world as in another, when God <br/>
had a church upon the earth, and that <br/>
the church of God would be re-estab-<br/>
lished upon the earth, and that I should <br/>
live to see it. These principles were riv-<br/>
eted upon my mind from the perusal of <br/>
the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New Testament]], with fervent <br/>
prayer that the Lord would show me what <br/>
was right and wrong, and lead me in the <br/>
path of salvation, without any regard to <br/>
the opinions of man: and the whisperings <br/>
of the [[Spirit of the Lord|Spirit of the Lord]] for the space of <br/>
three years, taught me that he was about <br/>
to set up his church and kingdom upon the <br/>
earth in the [[last days|last days]]. I was taught these <br/>
things from my youth by [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], <br/>
an aged man, who lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]], Con-<br/>
necticut, who was frequently called the <br/>
old prophet Mason; he taught me many <br/>
things which are now coming to pass. <br/>
He did not believe that any man had <br/>
authority to administer in the ordinances <br/>
of the gospel, but believed it was our <br/>
privilege through faith, prayer and fast-</p>

by the [[laying on of hands|laying on of hands]], which was the <br/>
case under his administration, as many <br/>
could testify.</p>

<p>In 1832, I was inspired to go to <br/>
[[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]; my brother, [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]], was <br/>
also directed by the Spirit of God to go <br/>
to the same place. When we met, we <br/>
both told our impressions, and it caused <br/>
us to marvel and wonder, what the Lord <br/>
wanted of us in Rhode Island; but as we <br/>
had made preparations to move to the <br/>
west, we let outward circumstances con-<br/>
trol us, and [[Jonah (OT)|Jonah]]-like, instead of going <br/>
to Rhode Island, we went to Richland, <br/>
Oswego County, New York, and there <br/>
remained until <time datetime=""",12/29/1833

tertained the elders, and offered ourselves <br/>
for baptism the first sermon we heard. <br/>
We read the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], and I re-<br/>

<p>We soon learned what the Lord wanted <br/>

<p>""I was standing on a peninsula in<br/>
the midst of a large body of water where there appeared<br/>
to be a large harbour or a pier built out for boats<br/>
to come into. I was surrounded by my friends <br/>
and while looking at this harbour I saw a Steam-<br/>
boat approaching it. There were bridges on the <br/>
pier for persons to cross and there came up a wind<br/>
and drove the Steam-boat under one of the bridges<br/>
and upset it.</p>

<p>I ran up to the boat expecting the<br/>
persons would all drown^ed^ and wishing to do something<br/>
to assist them. I put my hand to the side of the boat<br/>
and with one surge I pushed it under the bridge and it<br/>
righted it up and I told them to take care of themselves.</p>",
42658.0,13,,"<p>But it was not long before [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] saw them starting out into the<br/>
channel or main body of water again. The storms were<br/>
raging and the waters rough. I said to my friends that<br/>
if they did not understand the signs and the times and<br/>
the spirit of prophecy they would be apt to be lost. It was<br/>
but a few moments after when we saw the waves break<br/>
over the boat and she soon foundered and went down<br/>
with all on board and perished</p>

<p>The storm amd waters were still <br/>
very rough; yet I told my friends around me that<br/>
I believed I could stem those waves and storm and<br/>
swim in the waters better than the steam boat<br/>
did and that at any rate I was determined to try<br/>
it. But my freinds laughed at me and told <br/>
me that I could not stand the storm at all<br/>
but should be drowned.</p>

<p>The waters looked clear and <br/>
beautiful though exceedingly rough and I said that <br/>
I beleived I could swim and that I would try it<br/>
anyhow. They said I should drown. I answered<br/>
that I would have a frolic on the water first if  I <br/>
did and I <strike>drove</strike> ^dived^ off into the raging waves. I had<br/>
swam but a short distance when a towering wave<br/>
overwhelmed me for a time but I soon found myself<br/>
upon the top of it. I met the second wave in<br/>
the same way and for a while I struggled hard to <br/>
live in the midst of the storm and waves; but I <br/>
soon found that I gained upon every wave and stemmed<br/>
the torrent better and better. I soon had power<br/>
to swim with my head out of water so the waves<br/>
did not break over me at all and I found that I <br/>
swam a great distance. In looking about<br/>
me I saw my brother [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel]] by my side</p>",

April, 1834</time>.</p>

<p>The Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] invited me to <br/>
make his house my home; I accepted his <br/>
offer, and staid with him about one week. <br/>
I became acquainted with many of the <br/>
[[High Priests|high priests]], [[Elders|elders]] and Saints. I spent <br/>
one Sabbath in Kirtland and heard many <br/>
of the elders speak, and I felt to rejoice <br/>
before God for the light and knowledge <br/>
which was manifested to me during that <br/>
day.</p>

42659.0,4,1834-05-06,""">The first day of May, 1834</time>, was ap-<br/>
pointed for the [[Zion|Camp of Zion]] to start <br/>
from Kirtland to go up to [[Missouri|Missouri]] for <br/>
the redemption of their brethren. Only <br/>
a small portion of the Camp was ready. <br/>
The Prophet told those who were ready, <br/>
to go to [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]] and wait for the <br/>
remainder. I left, in company with about <br/>
twenty men, with the baggage wagons. <br/>
At night we pitched our tents. I went to <br/>
the top of the hill and looked down upon <br/>
the [[Camp of Israel|Camp of Israel]]. I knelt upon the <br/>
ground and prayed. I rejoiced and <br/>
praised the Lord that I had lived to see <br/>
some of the tents of Israel pitched, and <br/>
a company gathered by the command-<br/>
ment of God to go up and help redeem <br/>
Zion.</p>

<p>We tarried at New Portage until the <br/>
<time datetime=""",05/06/1834
42659.0,4,1834-05-07,""">6th</time>, when we were joined by the Prophet<br/>
and eighty-five more men. The day be-<br/>
fore they arrived, while passing through <br/>
the village of [[Middlebury, Van Wert County, Ohio|Middlebury]], the people <br/>
tried to count them; but the Lord multi-<br/>
plied them in the eyes of the people; so<br/>
that those who numbered them said there<br/>
were four hundred of them.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",05/07/1834
42659.0,4,1834-06-19,""">7th</time>, Brother Joseph organized <br/>
the camp, which consisted of about one <br/>
hundred and thirty men. On the follow-<br/>
ing day we continued our journey. We <br/>
pitched our tents at night and had prayers <br/>
night and morning. The Prophet told <br/>
us every day what we should do.</p>

<p>We were nearly all young men, gath-<br/>
ered from all parts of the country, and <br/>
strangers to each other; but we got ac-<br/>
quainted very soon, and had a happy <br/>
time together.</p>

<p>It was a great school for us to be led <br/>
by a Prophet of God a thousand miles,</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
through cities, towns, villages, and <br/>
through the wilderness.</p>

<p>When persons stood by to count us <br/>
they could not tell how many we num-<br/>
bered; some said five hundred, others <br/>
one thousand.</p>

<p>Many were astonished as we passed <br/>
through their towns. One lady ran to <br/>
her door, pushed her spectacles to the <br/>
top of her head, raised her hands, and <br/>
exclaimed: ""What under heavens has <br/>
broken loose?"" She stood in that posi-<br/>
tion the last I saw of her.</p>

<p>The published history of Zion's Camp <br/>
gives an account of the bones of a man <br/>
we dug out of a mound. His name was <br/>
[[Zelph (BofM)|Zelph]]. The Lord showed the Prophet <br/>
the history of the man in a vision. The <br/>
arrow by which he was killed was found <br/>
among his bones. One of his thigh <br/>
bones was broken by a stone slung in <br/>
battle. The bone was put into my <br/>
wagon, and I carried it to [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], <br/>
Missouri, and buried it in the earth.</p>

<p>The Lord delivered Israel in the days <br/>
of [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] by dividing the [[Red Sea|Red Sea]] so <br/>
they went over dry shod. When their <br/>
enemies tried to do the same, the water <br/>
closed upon them and they were drowned. <br/>

their enemies on the <time datetime=""",06/19/1834

forty feet in one night, so our enemies <br/>
could not cross. He also sent a great <br/>
hail-storm, which broke them up and <br/>
sent them seeking for shelter.</p>

<p>The Camp of Zion arrived at Brother <br/>
[[John Matthias Burk|Burk's]], in Clay County, Missouri, on <br/>
the <time datetime=""",06/24/1834

our tents on the premises. He told some <br/>
of the brethren of my company that he <br/>
had a spare room that some of us might <br/>
occupy if we would clean it. Our com-<br/>
pany accepted the offer, and, fearing <br/>
that some other company would get it <br/>
first, left all other business and went to <br/>
work, cleaning out the room, and imme-<br/>
diately spread down our blankets, so as <br/>
to hold a right to the room. It was but <br/>
a short time afterwards that our brethren, <br/>
who were attacked by [[cholera|cholera]], were <br/>
brought in and laid upon our beds. <br/>
None of us ever used those blankets <br/>
again, for they were buried with the <br/>
dead. So we gained nothing but experi-<br/>

bedding.</p>

as fast as any steamboat. In a little time it <br/>
became calm and I could rush through the water only<br/>
going in up to my loins. Soon I only went in up<br/>
to my knees and finally I could tread upon the top <br/>

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
[[Zion|Zion's Camp]] to [[Missouri|Missouri]], and we had <br/>
passed through all the trials of that jour-<br/>
ney, and had buried a number of our <br/>
brethren, as recorded in history, the <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] called the Camp together, and <br/>
organized the Church in Zion, and gave <br/>
much good counsel to all.</p>

<p>He advised all the young men, who <br/>
had no families, to stay in Missouri, and <br/>
not return to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. Not having any <br/>
family, I stopped with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], as <br/>
did [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]]. <br/>
We spent the summer together, laboring <br/>
hard, cutting wheat, quarrying rock, <br/>
making brick, or anything else we could <br/>
find to do.</p>

<p>In the Fall I had a desire to go and <br/>
preach the gospel. I knew the gospel <br/>
which the Lord had revealed to Joseph <br/>
Smith was true, and of such great value <br/>
that I wanted to tell it to the people <br/>
who had not heard it. It was so good <br/>
and plain, it seemed to me I could make <br/>
the people believe it.</p>

<p>I was but a Teacher, and it is not a <br/>
Teacher's office to go abroad and preach. <br/>
I dared not tell any of the authorities of <br/>
the Church that I wanted to preach, lest <br/>
they might think I was seeking for an <br/>
office.</p>

<p>I went to the woods where no one <br/>
could see me, and I prayed to the Lord <br/>
to open my way so that I could go and <br/>
preach the gospel. While I was praying, <br/>
the [[Spirit of the Lord|Spirit of the Lord]] came upon me, <br/>
and told me my prayer was heard and <br/>
that my request should be granted.</p>

<p>I felt very happy, and got up and <br/>
walked out of the woods into the trav-<br/>
eled road, and there I met a [[High Priest|high priest]] <br/>
who had lived in the same house with me <br/>
some six months.</p>

<p>He had not said a word to me about <br/>
preaching the gospel; but now, as soon <br/>
as I had met him, he said, ""the Lord <br/>
has revealed to me that it is your privi-<br/>
lege to be ordained, and to go and <br/>
preach the gospel.""</p>

<p>I told him I was willing to do what-<br/>
ever the Lord required of me. I did <br/>
tell him I had just asked the Lord to let <br/>
me go and preach.</p>

<p>In a few days a council was called at <br/>
Lyman Wight's, and I was ordained a <br/>
[[Priest|Priest]] and sent on a mission into [[Arkansas Territory|Ar-<br/>
kansas]] and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in company with <br/>
an [[Henry Brown|elder]]. This mission was given us by</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
Elder [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]], who was the <br/>
first [[Bishop|Bishop]] ordained in the Church.</p>

<p>The [[law of God|law of God]] to us in those days <br/>
was to go without purse or scrip. Our <br/>
journey lay through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], <br/>
from which the Saints had just been <br/>
driven, and it was dangerous for a Mor-<br/>
mon to be found in that part of the <br/>
State.</p>

<p>We put some [[Book of Mormon|Books of Mormon]] and <br/>
some clothing into our valises, strapped <br/>
them on our backs, and started on foot. <br/>
We crossed the ferry into Jackson <br/>
County, and went through it.</p>

<p>In some instances the Lord preserved <br/>
us, as it were by miracle, from the mob.</p>

<p>We dare not go to houses and get <br/>
food, so we picked and ate raw corn, <br/>
and slept on the ground, and did any <br/>
way we could until we got out of the <br/>
county.</p>

<p>We dared not preach while in that <br/>
county, and we did but little preaching <br/>
in the State of Missouri. The first time <br/>
I attempted to preach was on Sunday, in <br/>
a tavern, in the early part of December, <br/>
1834. It was snowing at the time and <br/>
the room was full of people. As I com-<br/>
menced to speak the landlord opened <br/>
the door, and the snow blew on the peo-<br/>
ple; and when I inquired the object of <br/>
having the door opened in a snow storm, <br/>
he informed me that he wanted some <br/>
light on the subject. I found that it was <br/>
the custom of the country.</p>

<p>How much good I did in that sermon <br/>
I never knew, and probably never shall <br/>
know until I meet that congregation in <br/>
judgment.</p>

<p>In the southern part of Missouri and <br/>
the northern part of Arkansas, in 1834, <br/>
there were but very few inhabitants.</p>

<p>We visited a place called [[Harmony Mission, Bates County, Missouri|Harmony <br/>
Mission]], on the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage River]], one of the <br/>
most crooked rivers in the west. This <br/>
mission was kept by a [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] min-<br/>
ister and his family.</p>

<p>We arrived there on Sunday night at <br/>
sunset. We had walked all day with <br/>
nothing to eat, and were very hungry <br/>
and tired. Neither the minister nor his <br/>
wife would give us anything to eat, nor <br/>
let us stay over night, because we were <br/>
Mormons, and the only chance we had <br/>
was to go twelve miles further down the <br/>
river, to an Osage Indian trading post, <br/>
kept by a Frenchman named [[Michel Geraud|Jereu]]. <br/>
And this wicked priest, who would not</p>",

this we as a people have been denied from the beginning<br/>
Persecution has rolled upon our heads from time to time<br/>
from portions of the United States like peels of thunder<br/>
because of our religion and no portion of the Government<br/>
as yet has steped forward for our relief and under<br/>
view of these things [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] feel it to be my right and<br/>
privilege to obtain what influence and power I can lawfully<br/>
in the United States for the protection of injured<br/>
inocence and if I loose my life in a good cause I<br/>
am willing to be sacrificed on the alter of virtue righteousness<br/>
and truth in maintaining the laws and Constitution of<br/>
the United States if need be for the general good of<br/>
mankind.""</p>

<p>Many other interesting remarks were<br/>
made. He was followed by Elders [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]]<br/>
and a unanimous vote was passed by the assembly <br/>
to support Joseph.</p>

in the morning with the Presidency and Twelve. Two<br/>
messengers arrived from the [[Black River, Wisconsin Territory|Pine Count^r^y]] with word<br/>

to the Indians. Joseph thought it wisdom not<br/>
to do it and said that if Lyman Wight did it<br/>

not to send him any counsel but to let him act<br/>

give us a piece of bread, lied to us about <br/>
the road, and sent us across the swamp, <br/>
and we wallowed knee-deep in mud and <br/>
water till ten o'clock at night in trying <br/>
to follow this crooked [[Osage River, Missouri|river]]. We then <br/>
left the swamp, and put out into the <br/>
prairie, to lie in the grass for the night.</p>

<p>When we came out of the swamp, we <br/>
heard an Indian drumming on a tin pail <br/>
and singing. It was very dark, but we <br/>
traveled towards the noise, and when we <br/>
drew near the Indian camp quite a num-<br/>
ber of large Indian dogs came out to <br/>
meet us. They smelt us, but did not <br/>
bark nor bite.</p>

<p>We were soon surrounded by [[Osage People|Osage <br/>
Indians]], and kindly received by Mr. <br/>
[[Michel Geraud|Jereu]] and his wife, who was an Indian. <br/>
She gave us an excellent supper and a <br/>
good bed, which we were thankful for <br/>
after the fatigue of the day.</p>

<p>As I laid my head upon my pillow, I <br/>
felt to thank God from the bottom of <br/>
my heart, for the exchange of the bar-<br/>
barous treatment of a civilized Presby-<br/>
terian priest for the humane, kind and <br/>
generous treatment of the savage Osage <br/>
Indians.</p>

<p>May God reward them both according <br/>
to their deserts.</p>

<p>We arose in the morning, after a good <br/>
night's rest. I was somewhat lame, <br/>
from wading in the swamp the night <br/>
before. We had a good breakfast. Mr. <br/>
Jereu sent an Indian to see us across the <br/>
river, and informed us that it was sixty <br/>
miles to the nearest settlement of either <br/>
white or red men.</p>

<p>We were too bashful to ask for any-<br/>
thing to take with us to eat; so we <br/>
crossed the river and started on our <br/>
day's journey of sixty miles without a <br/>
morsel of food of any kind.</p>

<p>We started about sunrise and crossed <br/>
a thirty-mile prairie, apparently as level <br/>
as a house floor, without shrub or water. <br/>
We arrived at timber about two o'clock <br/>
in the afternoon. As we approached the <br/>
timber a large [[black bear|black bear]] came out <br/>
towards us. We were not afraid of him, <br/>
for we were on the Lord's business, and <br/>
had not mocked God's prophets as did <br/>
the forty-two wicked children who said <br/>
to [[Elisha (OT)|Elisha]] ""Go up thou bald head,"" for <br/>
which they were torn by bears.</p>

<p>When the bear got within eight rods <br/>
of us he sat on his haunches and looked <br/>
at us a moment, and then ran away;</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
and we went on our way rejoicing. We <br/>
had to travel in the night, which was <br/>
cloudy and very dark, so we had great <br/>
difficulty to keep the road. Soon a large <br/>
drove of wolves gathered around, and <br/>
followed us. They came very close, and <br/>
at times it seemed as though they would <br/>
eat us up.</p>

<p>We had materials for striking a light, <br/>
and at ten o'clock, not knowing where <br/>
we were, and the wolves becoming so <br/>
bold, we thought it wisdom to make a <br/>
fire; so we stopped and gathered a lot <br/>
of oak limbs that lay on the ground, and <br/>
lit them, and as our fire began to burn <br/>
the wolves left us.</p>

<p>As we were about to lay down on the <br/>
ground—for we had no blankets—we <br/>
heard a dog bark.</p>

<p>My companion said it was a wolf; I <br/>
said it was a dog: but soon we heard a <br/>
cow bell. Then we each took a fire-<br/>
brand and went about a quarter of a <br/>
mile, and found the house, which was <br/>
sixty miles from where we started that <br/>
morning.</p>

<p>It was an old log cabin, about twelve <br/>
feet square, with no door, but an old <br/>
blanket was hung up in the door-way. <br/>
There was no furniture except one bed-<br/>
stead, upon which lay a woman, several <br/>
children and several small dogs. A [[Mr. Williams|man]] <br/>
lay on the bare floor with his feet to the <br/>
fire-place, and all were asleep. I went <br/>

he felt the weight of my hand he jumped <br/>

<p>The object of this meeting is to stir<br/>

assistance of the sisters we expect to get the nails and<br/>
glass and with the assistance of the brethren we intend<br/>
to do the rest. I will proclaim in public and private<br/>
that the Sisters bought the glass and nails by penny<br/>
subscription. Choose ye this day whom ye<br/>
will serve!</p>

<p>We shall call upon this vast<br/>
multitude for a donation to buy powder and fuse rope<br/>
to blast the rocks in the quarry. We want the<br/>
brethren to do as much as the sisters. We do<br/>
not intend to finish the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] this<br/>

eat. That was the hardest day's work <br/>
of my life.</p>

<p>The man's name was [[Mr. Williams|Williams]]. He <br/>
was in the mob in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]: and <br/>
after the Saints were driven out, he, with <br/>
many others, went south.</p>

<p>We got up in the morning and walked <br/>
in the rain twelve miles to the house of <br/>
a man named Bemon, who was also one <br/>
of the mob from Jackson County. They <br/>
were about sitting down to breakfast as <br/>
we came in.</p>

<p>In those days it was the custom of the <br/>
Missourians to ask you to eat even if <br/>
they intended to cut your throat as soon <br/>
as you got through; so he asked us to <br/>
take breakfast, and we were very glad of <br/>
the invitation.</p>

<p>He knew we were Mormons; and as <br/>
soon as we began to eat he began to <br/>
swear about the Mormons. He had a <br/>
large platter of bacon and eggs, and <br/>
plenty of bread on the table, and his <br/>
swearing did not hinder our eating, for <br/>
the harder he swore the harder we ate, <br/>
until we got our stomachs full; then we <br/>
arose from the table, took our hats, <br/>
thanked him for our breakfast, and the <br/>
last we heard of him he was still swear-<br/>
ing.</p>

<p>I trust the Lord will reward him for <br/>
our breakfast.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Church, it <br/>
was a great treat to an Elder in his travels <br/>
through the country to find a Mormon; <br/>
it was so with us. We were hardly in <br/>
[[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] when we heard of a family <br/>
named Akeman. They were in Jackson <br/>
County in the persecutions. Some of <br/>
the sons had been tied up there and <br/>
whipped on their bare backs with hickory <br/>
switches by the mob. We heard of their <br/>
living on [[Petit Jean River, Arkansas Territory|Petit Jean River]], in the Ar-<br/>
kansas Territory, and we went a long <br/>
way to visit them.</p>

<p>There had recently been heavy rains, <br/>
and a creek that we had to cross was <br/>
swollen to a rapid stream of eight rods <br/>
in width. There was no person living <br/>
nearer than two miles from the crossing, <br/>
and no boat. The people living at the <br/>
last house on the road, some three miles <br/>
from the crossing, said we would have to <br/>
tarry till the water fell before we could <br/>
cross. We did not stop, feeling to trust <br/>
in God.</p>

<p>Just as we arrived at the rolling flood <br/>
a [[Negro|negro]], on a powerful horse, entered</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
the stream on the opposite side and rode <br/>
through it. On our making our wants <br/>
known to him, he took us, one at a time, <br/>
behind him and carried us safely over, <br/>
and we went on our way rejoicing.</p>

<p>We arrived that night within five <br/>
miles of Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Akeman's]], and were kindly <br/>
entertained by a stranger. During the <br/>
night I had the following dream:</p>

<p>I thought an angel came to us, and <br/>
told us we were commanded of the Lord <br/>
to follow a certain straight path, which <br/>
was pointed out to us, let it lead us <br/>
wherever it might. After we had walked <br/>
in it awhile we came to the door of a <br/>
house, which was in the line of a high <br/>
wall running north and south, so that we <br/>
could not go around. I opened the door <br/>
and saw the room was filled with large <br/>
serpents, and I shuddered at the sight. <br/>
My [[Henry Brown|companion]] said he would not go <br/>
into the room for fear of the serpents. <br/>
I told him I should try to go through the <br/>
room though they killed me, for the <br/>
Lord had commanded it. As I stepped <br/>
into the room the serpents coiled them-<br/>
selves up, and raised their heads some <br/>
two feet from the floor, to spring at me. <br/>
There was one much larger than the rest <br/>
in the centre of the room, which raised <br/>
his head nearly as high as mine and <br/>
made a spring at me. At that instant I <br/>
felt as though nothing but the [[power of God|power of <br/>
God]] could save me, and I stood still. <br/>
Just before the serpent reached me he <br/>
dropped dead at my feet; all the rest <br/>
dropped dead, swelled up, turned black, <br/>
burst open, took fire and were consumed <br/>
before my eyes, and we went through <br/>
the room unharmed, and thanked God <br/>
for our deliverance.</p>

<p>I awoke in the morning and pondered <br/>
upon the dream. We took breakfast, <br/>
and started on our journey on Sunday <br/>
morning, to visit Mr. Akeman. I re-<br/>
lated to my companion my dream, and <br/>
told him we should see something strange. <br/>
We had great anticipations of meeting <br/>
Mr. Akeman, supposing him to be a <br/>
member of the Church. When we ar-<br/>
rived at his house he received us very <br/>
coldly, and we soon found that he had <br/>
apostatized. He brought railing accusa-<br/>
tions against the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] and <br/>
the authorities of the Church.</p>

<p>Word was sent through all the settle-<br/>
ments on the river for twenty miles that <br/>
two Mormon preachers were in the place.</p>",

then continued:</p>

<p>""I do not know whether the object of<br/>
the meeting has been told or not. I apologize for<br/>
not coming sooner.</p>

<p>I have had so much on my<br/>
mind since I saw you that I hardly know where<br/>
to begin; but one of the grand objects which I had<br/>
in view in calling this meeting was to make a<br/>
few remarks relative to the laws and ordinances<br/>
and the building of the Temple.</p>

<p>The reason I want to speak of<br/>
the laws is that the officers have difficulties in<br/>
administering the laws. We are republican and<br/>
wish to have the people rule but rule in righteousness.<br/>
Some would complain with what God Himself would<br/>
do. The laws are enacted by petition and they<br/>
can be repealed if they wish it but the people<br/>
ought not to complain of the officers but complain<br/>
of the lawmakers.</p>

<p>I am instructed by the City<br/>
Council to tell this people that if you do not like<br/>
any law which we have passed we will repeal it<br/>
for we are your servants. If any complain of<br/>
our rights and charters it is because they are wicked.<br/>
The Devil is in them.</p>

we have a simple gang of fellows who do not<br/>
know where their head or elbows are. If you preach</p>",

A mob was soon raised, and warning <br/>
sent to us to leave immediately or we <br/>
would be tarred and feathered, ridden <br/>
on a rail and hanged. I soon saw where <br/>
the serpents were. My [[Henry Brown|companion]] wanted <br/>
to leave; I told him no, I would stay <br/>
and see my dream fulfilled.</p>

<p>There was an old [[Jonathan Hubbel|gentleman]] and [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|lady]], <br/>
named Hubbel, who had read the [[Book of Mormon|Book <br/>
of Mormon]] and believed. Father Hub-<br/>
bel came to see us, and invited us to <br/>
make our home with him while we stayed <br/>
in the place. We did so, and labored <br/>
for him some three weeks with our axes, <br/>
clearing land, while we were waiting to <br/>
see the salvation of God.</p>

<p>I was commanded of the Lord by the <br/>
[[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] to go and warn Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Ake-<br/>
man]] to repent of his wickedness. I did <br/>
so, and each time he railed against me, <br/>
and the last time he ordered me out of <br/>
his house. When I went out he followed <br/>
me and was very angry. When he came <br/>
up to me, about eight rods from the <br/>
house, he fell dead at my feet, turned <br/>
black and swelled up, as I saw the ser-<br/>
pents do in my dream.</p>

<p>His family, as well as ourselves, felt it <br/>
was the judgment of God upon him. I <br/>
preached his funeral sermon. Many of <br/>
the mob died suddenly. We stayed <br/>
about two weeks after Akeman's death <br/>
and preached, baptized Mr. Hubbel and <br/>
his wife, and then continued on our <br/>
journey.</p>

<p>We concluded to go down [[Arkansas River, United States|Arkansas <br/>
River]] and cross into [[Tennessee|Tennessee]]. We <br/>
could not get passage on the boat, be-<br/>
cause of the low water, so we went on <br/>
the bank of the river and cut down a sound <br/>
cottonwood tree, three feet through, and <br/>
cut off a twelve-foot length from the <br/>
butt end ; and in two days we dug out a <br/>
canoe. We made a pair of oars and a <br/>
rudder, and on the <time datetime=""",03/11/1835
42659.0,8,1835-03-24,""">11th of March, 1835</time>, <br/>
we launched our canoe, and commenced <br/>
our voyage down the Arkansas River, <br/>
without provisions.</p>

<p>The first day we sailed twenty-five <br/>
miles, and stopped at night with a poor <br/>
family who lived on the bank of the <br/>
river. These kind folks gave us supper <br/>
and breakfast, and, in the morning, gave <br/>
us a johnny-cake and a piece of pork to <br/>
take with us on our journey.</p>

<p>We traveled about fifty miles that day, <br/>
and at night stopped at an old tavern, in <br/>
a village called [[Cadron Settlement, Faulkner County, Arkansas Territory|Cadron]], which was de-</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
serted because it was believed to be <br/>
haunted by [[evil spirits|evil spirits]].</p>

<p>We made a fire in the tavern, roasted <br/>
a piece of our pork, ate our supper, said <br/>
our prayers, went into a chamber, lay <br/>
down on the bare floor, and were soon<br/>
asleep.</p>

<p>I dreamed I was at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house <br/>
in a good feather bed, and I had a good <br/>
night's rest. When I awoke the bed <br/>
vanished, and I found myself on the bare <br/>
floor and well rested, not having been <br/>
troubled with evil spirits or anything <br/>
else.</p>

<p>We thanked the Lord for His good-<br/>
ness to us, ate the remainder of our pro-<br/>
visions and continued our journey down <br/>
the river to [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little Rock]], the capital of <br/>
Arkansas, which then consisted of only <br/>
a few cabins.</p>

<p>After visiting the place, we crossed <br/>
the river and tied up our canoe, which <br/>
had carried us safely one hundred and <br/>
fifty miles.</p>

<p>We then took the old military road, <br/>
leading from Little Rock to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], <br/>
Tennessee. This road lay through <br/>
swamps, and was covered with mud and <br/>
water most of the way, for one hundred <br/>
and seventy miles. We walked forty <br/>
miles in a day through mud and water <br/>
knee-deep.</p>

seventy miles of mud to save the people.</p>

<p>The [[Josiah Jackson|landlord]] wanted a little fun, so he <br/>
said he would keep me if I would preach. <br/>
He wanted to see if I could preach.</p>

<p>I must confess that by this time I be-<br/>
came a little mischievous, and pleaded<br/>
with him not to set me preaching.</p>

<p>The more I plead to be excused, the <br/>
more determined Mr. Jackson was that I <br/>
should preach. He took my valise, and <br/>
the landlady got me a good supper.</p>

<p>I sat down in a large hall to eat sup-<br/>
per. Before I got through, the room <br/>
began to be filled by some of the rich <br/>
and fashionable of [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], dressed in <br/>
their broadcloth and silk, while my <br/>
appearance was such as you can imagine, <br/>
after traveling through the mud as I had <br/>
been.</p>

<p>When I had finished eating, the table <br/>
was carried out of the room over the <br/>
heads of the people. I was placed in the <br/>
corner of the room, with a stand having <br/>
a Bible, hymn book and candle on it, <br/>
hemmed in by a dozen men, with the<br/>
landlord in the centre.</p>

<p>There were present some five hundred <br/>
persons who had come together, not to <br/>
hear a gospel sermon, but to have some <br/>
fun.</p>

<p>I read a hymn, and asked them to <br/>
sing. Not a soul would sing a word.</p>

<p>I told them I had not the gift of sing-<br/>
ing; but with the help of the Lord, I <br/>
would both pray and preach. I knelt <br/>
down to pray, and the men around me <br/>
dropped on their knees. I prayed to <br/>
the Lord to give me His Spirit and to <br/>
show me the hearts of the people. I <br/>
promised the Lord in my prayer I would <br/>
deliver to that congregation whatever <br/>
He would give to me. I arose and spoke <br/>
one hour and a half and it was one of <br/>
the best sermons of my life.</p>

<p>The lives of the congregation were <br/>
open to the vision of my mind, and I <br/>
told them of their wicked deeds and the <br/>
reward they would obtain. The men <br/>
who surrounded me dropped their heads. <br/>
Three minutes after I closed I was the <br/>
only person in the room.</p>

<p>Soon I was shown to a bed, in a room <br/>
adjoining a large one in which were <br/>
assembled many of the men whom I had</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
been preaching to. I could hear their <br/>
conversation.</p>

<p>One man said he would like to know <br/>
how that Mormon boy knew of their <br/>
past lives.</p>

<p>In a little while they got to disputing <br/>
about some doctrinal point. One sug-<br/>
gested calling me to decide the point. <br/>
The landlord said, ""no; we have had <br/>
enough for once.''</p>

<p>In the morning, I had a good break-<br/>
fast. The landlord said if I came that <br/>
way again to stop at his house, and stay <br/>
as long as I might choose.</p>

<p>After leaving Memphis, I traveled <br/>
through the country to [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], <br/>

in music and dancing.</p>

<p>I told him we did not really consider <br/>
them essential to salvation.</p>

not join our Church.</p>

<p>A warrant was issued, on the oath of <br/>

testifying that Christ would [[Second Coming of Jesus Christ|come]] in this <br/>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
receive the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] after they were <br/>
baptized, the brethren were condemned; <br/>
but were finally released by paying the <br/>
expenses of the mob court.</p>

<p>There was one peculiar circumstance <br/>
connected with this [[court trial|trial]] by a mob court, <br/>
which was armed to the teeth. When <br/>
the trial was through with, the people <br/>
were not willing to permit more than one <br/>
to speak. Warren Parrish had said but <br/>
few words, and they were not willing <br/>
to let David Patten speak. But he, <br/>
feeling the injustice of the court, and <br/>
being filled with the [[power of God|power of God]], <br/>
arose to his feet and delivered a speech <br/>
of about twenty minutes, holding them <br/>
spell-bound while he told them of their <br/>
wickedness and the abominations that <br/>
they were guilty of, also of the [[curse of God|curse of <br/>
God]] that awaited them, if they did not <br/>
repent, for taking up two harmless, in-<br/>
offensive men for preaching the gospel of <br/>
Christ.</p>

<p>When he had got through his speech <br/>
the judge said, ""You must be armed <br/>
with secret weapons, or you would not <br/>
talk in this fearless manner to an armed <br/>
court.""</p>

<p>Brother Patten replied; ""I have <br/>
weapons that you know not of, and they <br/>
are given me of God, for He gives me <br/>
all the power I have.""</p>

<p>The judge seemed willing to get rid of <br/>
them almost upon any terms, and offered <br/>
to dismiss them if their friends would <br/>
pay the costs, which the brethren pres-<br/>
ent freely offered to do.</p>

<p>When the two were released, they <br/>
mounted their horses and rode a mile to <br/>
Seth Utley's; but, as soon as they had <br/>
left, the court became ashamed that they <br/>
had been let go so easily and the whole <br/>
mob mounted their horses to follow them<br/>
to Utley's.</p>

<p>One of the Saints, seeing the state of <br/>
affairs, went on before the mob to notify <br/>
the brethren, so that they had time to <br/>
ride into the woods near by.</p>

<p>They traveled along about three miles <br/>
to Brother Albert Petty's, and went to <br/>
bed. The night was dark, and they fell <br/>
asleep.</p>

<p>But Brother Patten was warned in a <br/>
dream to get up and flee, as the mob <br/>
would soon be there. They both arose, <br/>
saddled their animals, and rode into the <br/>
adjoining county.</p>

[[Parson Browning|Parson Browning]] ordered the meeting to <br/>
be closed. I told the people I had come <br/>
ten miles to preach the gospel to them, <br/>
and was willing to stand in a cart, on a <br/>
pile of wood, on a fence, or any other <br/>
place they would appoint, to have that <br/>
privilege.</p>

<p>One man said he owned the fence and <br/>
land in front of the meeting house, and <br/>
we might use both, for he did not be-<br/>
lieve Mormonism would hurt either.</p>

<p>So the congregation crossed the road, <br/>
took down the fence and made seats of <br/>
it, and I preached to them one hour and <br/>
a half. At the close Mr. [[Randolph Alexander|Randolph <br/>

us permission to use the ferryboat. We <br/>
led our horses on board, and took the <br/>
oars to cross the river. Brother Smoot <br/>
had never used an oar, and I had not for <br/>
some years, so we made awkward work <br/>
of it. Soon he broke one oar, and I let <br/>
another fall overboard, which left us only <br/>
one broken oar to get to shore with. <br/>
We narrowly escaped running into a <br/>
steamboat. We struck shore half a mile <br/>

<p>Here we found a branch of the Church, <br/>
presided over by [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and <br/>
[[James Blakesly|James Blakesly]]. We accompanied them <br/>

selves for ordination, whom I was re-<br/>
quested to ordain, in company with <br/>
Elder [[William Draper|William Draper]]. We ordained <br/>
seven elders, nine priests, eleven teachers <br/>

<p>We spoke to the people several times <br/>

afflicted with the [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] that dwelt in <br/>

upon her head and commanded the <br/>
devil, in the name of Jesus Christ, to <br/>
depart out of her. It was immediately <br/>
done, and the woman arose with great <br/>
joy, and gave thanks and praise unto <br/>
God; for, according to her faith, she <br/>
was made whole from that hour.</p>

<p>A child, also, that was sick, was <br/>
healed by the laying on of hands, ac-<br/>
cording to the [[word of God|word of God]].</p>

<p>We walked thirty miles to visit another <br/>

bore our testimony to the people.</p>

<p>A Sister Carns here came to us and <br/>
requested to have the ordinance for the <br/>
healing of the sick performed for two of <br/>
her children who were afflicted. One <br/>
was a suckling child, which was lying at</p>

arms and presented it before the elders, <br/>
who laid their hands upon it, and it was <br/>
made whole immediately, and I handed <br/>
it back to the mother entirely healed.</p>

<p>We afterwards laid hands upon the <br/>
other, when it was also healed. It was <br/>
done by the [[power of God|power of God]], in the name <br/>
of Jesus Christ, and the parents praised <br/>
God for His goodness.</p>

<p>After leaving the Saints in this place, <br/>
we returned to Kingston, and crossed <br/>
Lake Ontario in company with [[Isaac Russell|Isaac <br/>

<p>Brother Russell seemed to be con-<br/>

followed him when he subsequently went <br/>

[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], <br/>

continued with us to [[Schenectady, Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]], where <br/>

<p>We walked ten miles to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]], and <br/>
took passage on the steamboat <i>Bangor</i>, <br/>

<p>The town of [[Vinalhaven, Waldo County, Maine|Vinal Haven]] includes <br/>
both North and [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Fox Islands]], in <br/>
latitude 44° north, and longitude 69° 10' <br/>
west. The population numbered, at the <br/>
time of my visit, about 1,800. The in-<br/>
habitants were intelligent and indus-<br/>
trious, and hospitable to strangers. They <br/>
got most of their wealth and living by <br/>
fishing. The town fitted out over one <br/>
hundred licensed sailing vessels, besides <br/>
smaller craft.</p>

<p>North Fox Island is nine miles long <br/>
by two miles in width and had a popula-<br/>
tion of 800. They had a post office, <br/>
one store, a Baptist church and meeting <br/>
house, four school houses and a tide <br/>
grist mill.</p>

<p>The land was rather poor, yet there <br/>
were some good farms. The products <br/>
were wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and <br/>
grass. The principal timber was fir, <br/>
spruce, hemlock and birch. Raspberries <br/>
and gooseberries grew in great abun-<br/>
dance, and some up-land cranberries <br/>
were raised. The principal stock of the <br/>
island were sheep.</p>

earth I ever saw. It would be difficult <br/>
for any person to describe it. It is about <br/>
ten miles in length by five in width, and <br/>
is one universal mass of rocks, formed <br/>
into shelves, hills, and valleys, and cut <br/>
up into necks and points to make room <br/>
for the coves and harbors that run <br/>
through and through the [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|island]].</p>

<p>The population was 1,000. The in-<br/>
habitants got their living entirely by <br/>
fishing. There is no chance for farming <br/>
upon the island, and but a few garden <br/>
patches, which are cultivated at great <br/>
expense. Some few sheep are raised <br/>
there.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants fish in the <br/>
region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and bring <br/>
their fish home and cure them on flakes <br/>
and prepare them for the market. They <br/>
supply the market with great quantities <br/>
of cod, mackerel and boxed herring.</p>

<p>Upon this island there were two stores,<br/>
three tide saw mills, six school houses <br/>
and a small branch of the [[Methodist|Methodist]] <br/>
church, presided over by a priest.</p>

<p>What timber there is upon this island,<br/>
such as pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and <br/>
birch, and the whortleberries, raspberries<br/>
and gooseberries, mostly grow out of <br/>
the cracks of the rocks.</p>

<p>Great quantities of fish, and in almost <br/>
endless variety, inhabit the coves and <br/>
harbors around the islands. The whale, <br/>
blackfish, shark, ground shark, pilot-fish, <br/>
horse mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, hali-<br/>
but, cod, polleck, tom cod, hake, had-<br/>
dock, mackerel, shad bass, alewife,<br/>
herring, pohagen, dolphin, whiting, <br/>
frost-fish, flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, <br/>

<p>Thus I have given a brief description<br/>
of [[Vinalhaven, Waldo County, Maine|Vinal Haven]]. It was quite dark <br/>
when we landed there, without a farthing<br/>
in money. We made our way over the <br/>
rocks and through the cedars the best <br/>
way we could, until we found a house, <br/>
when we rapped at the door. A woman<br/>
put her head out of the window and asked <br/>
who was there and what was wanted.</p>

<p>I told her we were two strangers, and <br/>
wanted a bed to lie down upon until <br/>
morning.</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
She let us in and gave us a bed, and <br/>
we slept until quite late, it being Sunday <br/>
morning. When we came out and took <br/>
breakfast it was nearly noon. I asked <br/>
her what she charged for our entertain-<br/>
ment, and she replied that we were wel-<br/>
come.</p>

<p>I then asked her if there was any <br/>
religion or minister or church on the <br/>
island.</p>

<p>She informed me there was a [[Baptist|Baptist]] <br/>
minister, by the name of [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], who <br/>
had a congregation and meeting house <br/>
about five miles from there.</p>

<p>We thanked her for her kindness, <br/>
walked to the meeting house and stepped <br/>
inside the doorway. We stood there <br/>
until a deacon came to the door, when I <br/>
asked him to go and tell the minister in <br/>
the pulpit that there were two servants <br/>
of God at the door, who had a message<br/>
to deliver to that people and wished the <br/>
privilege of delivering it.</p>

<p>He sent for us to come to the pulpit, <br/>
so we walked through the congregation <br/>
with our valises under our arms, and <br/>
took a seat by the side of the minister, <br/>
who was about to speak as we came to <br/>
the door.</p>

<p>He arose and delivered his discourse <br/>
to the people, occupying about half an <br/>
hour. When he closed he asked me <br/>
what was my wish.</p>

<p>1 told him we wished to speak to the <br/>
people at any hour that would suit his <br/>
or their convenience; so he gave notice <br/>
that there were two strangers present<br/>
who would speak to the people at five<br/>
o'clock that evening.</p>

<p>We were quite a source of wonder-<br/>
ment to the people, as they had no idea <br/>
who we were.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton asked us home to tea <br/>
with him, and we gladly accepted the <br/>
invitation. When we arrived at his <br/>
house I opened my valise and took out <br/>
the [[Bible|Bible]], [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], and [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doc-<br/>
trine and Covenants]], laid them upon <br/>
the table, and took my seat.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton took up the books and <br/>
looked at them, but said nothing. I <br/>
then asked him if there were any school <br/>
houses upon the island. and if so, <br/>
whether they were free to preach in. <br/>
He answered that there were four, num-<br/>
bered respectively from one to four, and <br/>
that they were free.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton and family accompanied</p>",

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
us to the meeting-house, where we met a <br/>
large congregation, none of whom knew <br/>
who we were, or anything about our <br/>
profession, except the minister.</p>

<p>Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] and I went to the stand, <br/>
and I arose with peculiar feelings and <br/>
addressed the congregation for one hour, <br/>
taking for my text ##Galatians 1:8-9|Galatians i. 8–9.##</p>

<p>This was the first time that I or any <br/>
other elder of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus <br/>
Christ of Latter-day Saints]] had (to my <br/>
knowledge) attempted to preach the <br/>
the [[fulness of the gospel|fullness of the gospel]] and the [[Book of Mormon|Book<br/>
of Mormon]] to the inhabitants of any <br/>
island of the sea.</p>

<p>I had much liberty in speaking, and <br/>
informed the people that the Lord had <br/>
raised up a prophet and organized His <br/>
Church as in the days of Christ and the <br/>
ancient apostles, with prophets, apostles, <br/>
and the gifts as anciently, and that He <br/>
had brought forth the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>At the close of my remarks Elder Hale <br/>
bore testimony.</p>

<p>I gave liberty for any one to speak <br/>
that might wish to. As no one re-<br/>
sponded, I announced that we would <br/>
hold meetings the next four evenings at <br/>
the school-houses, beginning at No. I.</p>

<p>During the first thirteen days of our <br/>
sojourn upon the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|island]] we preached <br/>
seventeen discourses, being invited by <br/>
the people to tarry with them. I left a <br/>
copy of the [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and Covenants]] <br/>
with Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]] for his perusal.</p>

<p>He read it, and the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] <br/>
bore testimony to him of its truth. He <br/>
pondered over it for days, and he walked <br/>
his room until midnight trying to decide <br/>
whether to receive or reject it. He and <br/>
his family attended about a dozen of my <br/>
first meetings, and then he made up his <br/>
mind, contrary to the dictation of the <br/>
Spirit ol God to him, to reject the testi-<br/>
mony and come out against me. How-<br/>
ever, we commenced baptizing his flock.</p>

<p>The first two we baptized were a sea <br/>
captain, by the name of [[Justus Ames|Justin Eames]], <br/>
and his [[Betsey Hudson Ames|wife]]. Brother Jonathan H. <br/>
Hale went down into the sea and bap-<br/>
tized them on the <time datetime=""",09/03/1837
42659.0,16,1837-09-17,""">3rd of September</time>, and <br/>
these were the first baptisms performed <br/>
by proper authority upon any of the <br/>
islands of the sea (to my knowledge) in <br/>
this dispensation.</p>

<p>Before we left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] some of the <br/>
leading apostates there had tried to dis-<br/>
courage Brother Hale about going on his</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
mission, telling him he would never bap-<br/>
tize any one, and he had better remain <br/>
at home. When Captain Eames offered <br/>
himself for baptism, I told Brother Hale <br/>
to go and baptize him, and prove those <br/>
men [[false prophets|false prophets]], and he did so.</p>

<p>On the following Sabbath I baptized <br/>
his brother, [[Ebenezer Ames|Ebenezer Eames]], another <br/>
sea captain, and a [[Melana Ames Dyer|young lady]].</p>

<p>Mr. Newton, the [[Baptist|Baptist]] minister, now <br/>
commenced a war against us, and sent to <br/>
the [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Island]] for a Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglas]], a <br/>
[[Methodist|Methodist]] minister (with whom he had <br/>
been at variance for years) to come over <br/>
and help him put down ""Mormonism.""</p>

<p>Mr. Douglas came over, and they got <br/>
as many people together as they could <br/>
and held a conference. He railed against<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], the prophet, and the Book of <br/>
Mormon, and, taking that book in his <br/>
hand, with out-stretched arm, declared <br/>
that he feared none of the judgments of <br/>
God that would come upon him for re-<br/>
jecting it as the [[word of God|word of God]], (I never <br/>
heard what his sentiments upon this sub-<br/>
ject were at the end of his term of <br/>
fourteen years' imprisonment in the <br/>
[[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] Penitentiary, for an outrage <br/>
upon his daughter, the judgment of <br/>
which was given upon the testimony of <br/>
his wife and daughter.)</p>

<p>I was present and heard Mr. Douglass' <br/>
speech upon this occasion, and took <br/>
minutes of the same. When he closed I <br/>
arose and informed the people that I <br/>
would meet with them next Sunday <br/>
in the meeting-house, and answer Mr. <br/>
Douglass, and wished him, as well as the <br/>
people to be present.</p>

<p>I informed the people that Mr. Doug-<br/>
lass had made many false statements <br/>
against Joseph Smith and the Latter-day <br/>
Saints, with whom he had no acquain-<br/>
tance, and he had misquoted much Scrip-<br/>
ture, all of which I could correct.</p>

<p>We continued to baptize the people on <br/>
the North Island until we baptized every <br/>
person who owned an interest in the <br/>
Baptist meeting-house. I then followed <br/>
Mr. Douglass home to the South Island, <br/>
and preached the gospel to and baptized <br/>
nearly all the members of his church.</p>

<p>The excitement became great on both <br/>
islands, and on Sunday, the <time datetime=""",09/17/1837
42659.0,16,,""">17th of <br/>
September</time>, I met a large assembly from <br/>
both islands, and took the same subject <br/>
that Mr. Douglass had dwelt upon in his </p>",
42659.0,17,1837-09-06,"<p><i>TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE</i></p>

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
remarks against the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] <br/>
and our principles.</p>

<p>I spoke two and a half hours, and an-<br/>
swered every objection against the Book <br/>
of Mormon, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], or our prin-<br/>
ciples.</p>

<p>I had good attention and the people <br/>
seemed satisfied. At the close of the <br/>
meeting Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] administered the <br/>
ordinance of baptism.</p>

<p>Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], in order to save his <br/>
cause, went to the mainland and brought <br/>
over several ministers with him and held <br/>
a protracted meeting. They hoped by <br/>
this to stop the [[work of God|work of God]], but all to <br/>
no avail, for the whole people would <br/>
attend our meeting and receive the [[word of God|word <br/>
of God]], and we continued to baptize.</p>

<p>We visited the dwellings of most of <br/>
inhabitants during our sojourn there.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion, while standing <br/>
upon Mr. [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Carver's]] farm, on the east end <br/>
of the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Island]], we counted fifty-<br/>
five islands in that region, the majority <br/>
of which were not inhabited. We also <br/>
saw twenty ships under sail at the same <br/>
time.</p>

<p>We had no lack for food while upon <br/>
the island, for if we did not wish to <br/>
trouble our friends for a dinner, we only <br/>
had to borrow a spade or a hoe, and a <br/>
kettle and go to the beach and dig a <br/>
peck of clams. These, when boiled, <br/>
would make a delicious meal, which we <br/>
often availed ourselves of.</p>

<p>One day Elder Hale and I ascended <br/>
to the top of a high granite rock <br/>
on the [[South Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|South Island]], for prayer and sup-<br/>
plication. We sat down under the shade<br/>
of a pine tree which grew out of a fis-<br/>
sure in the rock, and Elder Hale read <br/>
the ##Jeremiah 16:16|sixteenth chapter## of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], where <br/>
mention is made of the hunters and <br/>
fishers that God would send in the [[last days|last <br/>
days]] to gather Israel.</p>

<p>Of a truth here we were upon an island <br/>
of the sea, standing upon a rock where <br/>
we could survey the gallant ships and <br/>
also the islands, which were as full of <br/>
rocks, ledges, and caves as any part of the <br/>
earth. And what had brought us here? <br/>
To search out the [[blood of Ephraim|blood of Ephraim]],<br/>
the honest and meek of the earth, and <br/>
gather them from those islands, rocks, <br/>
holes, and caves of the earth unto Zion.</p>

<p>We prayed, and rejoiced together. <br/>
The [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] rested upon us; we <br/>
spoke of Christ and the ancient prophets</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
and apostles in Jerusalem; of [[Nephi (BofM)|Nephi]], <br/>
[[Alma (BofM)|Alma]], [[Mormon (BofM)|Mormon]], and [[Moroni (BofM)|Moroni]] in America; <br/>
Joseph, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver]], and the apostles <br/>
in our own day, and we rejoiced that we <br/>
were upon the islands of the sea search-<br/>
ing out the blood of Israel.</p>

<p>While being filled with these medita-<br/>
tions and the Spirit of God, we fell <br/>
upon our knees and gave thanks to the <br/>
God of heaven, and felt to pray for<br/>
all Israel.</p>

<p>After spending most of the day in <br/>
praise and thanksgiving, we descended <br/>
to the settlement and held a meeting <br/>
with the people.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",09/06/1837
42659.0,17,1837-10-02,""">6th of September</time> we called <br/>
upon Captain [[Benjamin Coombs|Benjamin Coombs]], and <br/>
visited his flakes, where he had one<br/>
thousand quintals of codfish drying for <br/>
the market. They had mostly been <br/>
caught in the region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. <br/>
While we were passing [[Carvey|Carvey's Wharf]] <br/>
our attention was called to a large school <br/>
of mackerel playing by the side of the <br/>
wharf. Several men were pitching them <br/>
out with hooks. We also flung in a hook <br/>
and caught all we wanted, then went on <br/>
our way.</p>

<p>We continued to labor, preaching and <br/>
baptizing, and organized a branch of <br/>
the Church upon each island, and, <br/>
finally, on the <time datetime=""",10/02/1837

parted with the Saints on the North <br/>

<p>We walked from [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] to [[Bath, Sagadahoc County, Maine|Bath]], a <br/>
distance of forty-six miles, in one day, <br/>
and at the latter place attended a [[Baptist|Bap-<br/>

to a large congregation in the evening, <br/>
and the people gave good attention and <br/>
wished to learn more about our doc-<br/>
trines.</p>

<p>On the following day we walked thirty-<br/>
six miles to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]], and the next day <br/>
to Scarboro. Here I again met with my <br/>
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]] family.</p>

parting hand to Brother Jonathan H. <br/>

[[curse of God|curse of God]] would rest upon him, and <br/>
that his wickedness would be made mani-<br/>
fest in the eyes of the people. (While <br/>
visiting these Islands several years after-<br/>

really been fulfilled, and that he was <br/>
serving out a fourteen years' term of <br/>
imprisonment for a beastly crime).</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodruff crossed the thorough-<br/>
fare in a boat and walked ten miles, the <br/>
length of the island, to meet me, on the <br/>
last day of the year. I held a meeting<br/>
the same day in the school house, and at <br/>
the close of the meeting baptized two <br/>
persons in the sea, at full tide, before a<br/>
large assembly.</p>

upon one of the islands of the sea, a <br/>

Woodruff, my companion. I had been <br/>
declaring the [[word of the Lord|word of the Lord]] through <br/>

was working among the people, preju-<br/>

<p>I spent this New Year's Day visiting <br/>
the Saints and their neighbors, and met a <br/>
congregation at Captain [[Charles Brown|Charles Brown's]],<br/>
where I spoke to them for awhile, and at <br/>
the close of my remarks led three per-<br/>

them. Two of these were sea captains, <br/>

the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Island]]. Here I found that <br/>
the seed I had sown was bringing forth <br/>
fruit. Six persons were ready for bap-<br/>
tism.</p>

<p>But my mission to these [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|islands]] was <br/>
not an exception to the general rule: <br/>
success did not come without many <br/>
obstacles presenting themselves. Those <br/>
who rejected the word were frequently <br/>
inspired by the evil one to make an <br/>
attempt at persecution.</p>

<p>Some of those who felt to oppose me <br/>
went down to the harbor and got a <br/>
swivel and small arms, and planted them <br/>
close by the school house, near the sea <br/>
shore, and while I was speaking they <br/>
commenced firing their cannon and guns. <br/>
I continued speaking in great plainness, <br/>
but my voice was mingled with the re-<br/>
port of musketry.</p>

<p>I told the people my garments were <br/>
clear of the blood of the inhabitants of <br/>
that island, and asked if any wished to <br/>
embrace the gospel. Two persons came <br/>
forward and wished to be baptized, and <br/>
I baptized them.</p>

<p>On the following day when I went <br/>
down to the seaside to baptize a man, <br/>
the rabble commenced firing guns again, <br/>
as on the previous night. I afterwards <br/>
learned that notices were posted up, <br/>
warning me to leave the town, but I <br/>
thought it was better to obey God than <br/>
man, and, therefore, did not go.</p>

<p>The next day I baptized three persons, <br/>
and two days subsequently a couple of <br/>
others.</p>

<p>I had ample evidence of the fact that <br/>
lying spirits had gone out into the world, <br/>
for three persons whom I had baptized <br/>
had been visited by Mr. [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]], who <br/>
told them that I denied the Bible and <br/>
could not be depended upon; and they <br/>
yielded to his insinuations until the devil <br/>
took possession of them, and they were in <br/>
a disaffected condition, and sent for me.</p>

<p>When I met them they were in great <br/>
affliction, but when I instructed them in <br/>
regard to the principles of the gospel, <br/>
and administered to them, they were <br/>
delivered from the evil influence and <br/>
rejoiced.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",02/15/1838
42659.0,19,1838-02-21,""">15th of February</time> I again <br/>
crossed to the North Island, and after <br/>
remaining there seven days visiting, we <br/>
returned to [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]]. Here I met Brother <br/>
[[James Townsend|James Townsend]], who had just arrived <br/>
from [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]].</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
I ordained Brother Townsend to the <br/>
office of an [[Elder|elder]], and we concluded to <br/>
take a journey to [[Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine|Bangor]], and offer the <br/>
gospel to the inhabitants of that city.</p>

<p>We undertook the journey on foot in <br/>
the dead of winter, when the snow was <br/>
very deep, and the first day broke the <br/>
road for seven miles to [[Searsmont, Waldo County, Maine|Scarsmont]]. The <br/>
day following, it being Sunday, we held <br/>
two meetings, preached the gospel to the <br/>
people, and were kindly entertained.</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day we <br/>
wallowed through snowdrifts for a mile, <br/>
to meet an appointment to preach in a <br/>
schoolhouse, and I got one of my ears <br/>
frozen on the way; but notwithstanding <br/>
the severity of the weather, we had a <br/>
large and attentive audience. We also <br/>
spent the next two days with the people <br/>
there and held meetings.</p>

<p>On the evening of the <time datetime=""",02/21/1838
42659.0,19,,""">21st of Febru-<br/>
ary</time>, as we came out of the school-house, <br/>
a light appeared on the northeastern <br/>
horizon, and spread to the west, and <br/>
soon rolled over our heads. It had the <br/>
appearance of fire, blood, and smoke, <br/>
and at times resembled contending ar-<br/>
mies. The heavens were illuminated for <br/>
the space of half an hour. It seemed at <br/>
times as though the veil was about to rend <br/>
in twain, and the elements were contend-<br/>
ing with each other.</p>

<p>We looked upon it as one of the [[signs of the times|signs]] <br/>
in the heavens predicted by the prophets <br/>
of old, as to appear in the [[last days|last days]]. We <br/>
were wading through deep snowdrifts <br/>
most of the time while witnessing this <br/>

<p>The following day we walked fifteen <br/>
miles through deep snow to [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], and, <br/>
after being refused lodging for the night <br/>
by eight families, we were kindly enter-<br/>
tained by a Mr. [[Thomas Tapley|Thomas Teppley]].</p>

<p>There was an interesting incident con-<br/>
nected with our stay at his house. After <br/>
eating our supper, it being late in the <br/>
evening. Mr. Teppley placed a stand <br/>
before me with a [[Bible|Bible]] upon it, asking <br/>
me to read a chapter and have prayers <br/>
with them, he being a religious man.</p>

<p>I opened the Bible mechanically, when <br/>
the ##Matthew 25|25th chapter## of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] being the <br/>
first to catch my eye, I read it, and as I <br/>
closed the book Mr. Teppley turned to <br/>
his wife and said, ""Is not this a strange <br/>
thing?"" Then he explained to us that <br/>
he had just read that chapter and closed <br/>
the book when we rapped at the door,</p>",

and [[Thomas Tapley|he]] felt impressed to say, ""Walk in, <br/>
gentlemen.""</p>

<p>There is probably no other chapter in <br/>
the whole book that would have the same <br/>
influence in causing any one to feed a <br/>
person who professed to be a [[servant of God|servant of <br/>
God]] and asked for bread.</p>

<p>After becoming acquainted with his <br/>
circumstances I thought it providential <br/>
that we were led to his house, for al-<br/>
though he was a professor of religion and <br/>
a [[Methodist|Methodist]], he was in a state of despair, <br/>
believing that he had committed the [[unpardonable sin|un-<br/>
pardonable sin]].</p>

<p>However, I told him what the unpar-<br/>
donable sin was, and that he had not <br/>
committed it, but that it was a trick of <br/>
the devil to make him think so, in order <br/>
to torment him. He then acknowledged <br/>
that he went down to the wharf a few <br/>
evenings before, with the intention of <br/>
drowning himself, but when he looked <br/>
into the cold, dark water, he desisted <br/>
and returned home, and had said nothing <br/>
previous to anyone about it.</p>

<p>I taught him the principles of the <br/>
gospel, which proved a comfort to him. <br/>
We spent the following day in visiting <br/>
the people of [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], and in the evening <br/>
preached in a brick school house, pro-<br/>
vided by Mr. Teppley, and many wished <br/>
to hear more from us.</p>

<p>We next visited [[Northport, Waldo County, Maine|Northport]] and [[Frankfort, Waldo County, Maine|Frank-<br/>
fort]], holding meetings at both places, <br/>
and on the <time datetime=""",03/01/1838

tered [[Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine|Bangor]], which at that time had a <br/>
population of ten thousand. This was <br/>
my [[birthday|birthday]], I being thirty-one years of <br/>
age.</p>

<p>I visited some of the leading men of <br/>
Bangor, and they granted me the use of <br/>
the City Hall, where I preached to good <br/>
audiences for two successive evenings. <br/>
This was the first time a Latter-day <br/>
Saint Elder had preached in that town. <br/>
Many were anxious to learn more about <br/>
our principles, but our visits through all <br/>
the towns from [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] to Bangor <br/>
were necessarily brief, owing to our ap-<br/>
pointments upon the [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Islands]]. It was <br/>
like casting our bread upon the waters <br/>
and trusting in God for the result.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",03/05/1838

again had the privilege of meeting with</p>

the Saints for prayer and praise before <br/>
the Lord.</p>

<p>On my arrival I received a package of <br/>
letters from friends abroad. One was <br/>
from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and gave an account of <br/>
the apostasy and tribulations which the <br/>
Saints were passing through. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
the Prophet and others, with their fam-<br/>
ilies, had gone to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and the <br/>
Saints were following him.</p>

<p>Brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] returned home and <br/>
I was again left alone in the ministry.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the <time datetime=""",03/22/1838

Brother [[Cyrus Starrett|Sterrett]] and I, accompanied by <br/>
[[Phebe Philbrook Starrett|our]] [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wives]], went several hundred yards <br/>
from the shore to a sand-bar (it being <br/>
now low tide), to dig clams. The <br/>
ground near the shore was much lower <br/>
than the bar we were on, and while we <br/>
were all busy digging clams and talking <br/>
Mormonism, the dashing of the waves <br/>
of the incoming tide against the shore <br/>
suddenly made us conscious that we had <br/>
fifty yards of water between us and the <br/>
shore.</p>

<p>The surf waves also added to our diffi-<br/>
culty, and as we had no boat, our only <br/>
alternattve was to cross our four arms, <br/>
thus forming a kind of arm chair for our <br/>
wives to sit upon, and carry them in <br/>
turn to the shore, wading through two <br/>
and a half feet of water.</p>

<p>By the time that we got our wives and <br/>
clams safely landed, the truth of the <br/>
old saying was firmly impressed upon our <br/>
minds, that ""Time and tide wait for no <br/>
man,"" not even for a preacher of the <br/>
gospel.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",03/28/1838
42659.0,20,,""">28th of March</time> I received a <br/>
letter from Zion, requesting me to coun-<br/>
sel the Saints I had baptized to sell their <br/>
property and gather up to Zion.</p>

<p>About this time the Lord was mani-<br/>
festing himself upon the islands in vari-<br/>
ous ways, by dreams, visions, healings, <br/>
signs and wonders. I will relate one <br/>
peculiar circumstance of this kind that <br/>
occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Ebenezer Carver]] had been inves-<br/>
tigating our doctrines for quite a length <br/>
of time, and, having a great desire to <br/>
know the truth of our religion, he walked <br/>
to the sea shore, wishing that he might <br/>
have some manifestation in proof of its <br/>
truth.</p>

<p>The passage of Scripture came to his <br/>
mind that there would be no sign given <br/>
""but the sign of the prophet [[Jonah (OT)|Jonas]].""</p>",
42659.0,21,1838-04-06,"<p><i>TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.</i></p>

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
While this thought was in his mind a <br/>
large fish arose to the top of the water, a <br/>
distance from him in the sea, and sud-<br/>
denly sank out of sight. He much de-<br/>
sired to see it again, and soon it arose <br/>
to the top of the water, accompanied by <br/>
another fish of about the same size, and <br/>
one of them swam on the water in a <br/>
straight line towards Mr. [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Carver]] as he <br/>
stood upon the shore. It came as near <br/>
to him the water would permit, and <br/>
then stopped and gazed at him with a <br/>
penetrating eye, as though it had a mes-<br/>
sage for him. It then returned to its <br/>
mate in the ocean, and swam out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Carver retraced his steps home-<br/>
ward, meditating upon the scene and the <br/>
wonderful condescension of the Lord.</p>

<p>It is proper to remark that this was at <br/>
a season of the year when fish of that <br/>
size are never known upon those shores <br/>
or seas, and they are never, at any sea-<br/>
son, known to come ashore as in the <br/>
case mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Carver was convinced that it was <br/>
intended by the Lord as a sign to him.</p>

<p>Two days after this event I visited Mr. <br/>
Carver at his house, and found his [[Mary Stinson Carver|wife]] <br/>
confined to her bed with a fever, and <br/>
she requested me to administer to her. I <br/>
placed my [[laying on of hands|hands]] upon her head, the <br/>
[[power of God|power of God]] rested upon me, and I <br/>
commanded her in the name of Jesus <br/>
Christ to arise and walk.</p>

<p>She arose and was healed from that <br/>
instant, and she walked down to the sea <br/>
and I baptized her in the same place <br/>
where the fish visited her husband. I <br/>
confirmed her there, and she was filled <br/>
with the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]], and returned to <br/>
her home rejoicing.</p>

<p>I now called the people together and <br/>
exhorted them to sell their property and <br/>
prepare to accompany me to the land of <br/>
Zion. I had labored hard for many days <br/>
for the temporal and spiritual welfare of <br/>
the inhabitants of those [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|islands]], and the <br/>
Lord had blessed my labors and given <br/>
me many souls as seals of my ministry, <br/>
for which I felt to praise Him; and now <br/>
I felt to labor quite as zealously to gather <br/>
out those who had embraced the gospel, <br/>
and lead them to Zion.</p>

<p>The worst difficulty which the Saints <br/>
had to contend with in that day was <br/>
from false brethren. [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]], <br/>
who had been a prominent [[Elder|elder]] in the <br/>
Church, and had labored with me as a</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
missionary, had apostatized and been [[cut off|cut <br/>
off]] from the Church. Learning that I <br/>
was building up branches of the Church <br/>
upon the island, he and other apostates <br/>
conspired to block up my way by writing <br/>
lies to the people and stirring up a spirit <br/>
of mobocracy upon the islands.</p>

<p>They succeeded in exerting a strong <br/>
influence with the wicked, but I knew <br/>
they could not hinder the [[work of God|work of God]].</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/06/1838
42659.0,21,1838-04-11,""">6th of April</time> I held a meeting <br/>
at Brother Ebenezer Carver's, and, <br/>
though the hearts of the wicked were <br/>
stirred up in bitterness against me, the <br/>

close of the meeting I baptized three <br/>
persons. One of these was Mrs. [[Abigail Waterman Carver|Abi-<br/>

Carver, who was seventy years of age <br/>
and in poor health. She had not so <br/>
much as visited a neighbor's house for <br/>
six years, but upon this occasion she <br/>
walked with boldness to the sea shore <br/>
and I baptized her, and she returned <br/>
rejoicing.</p>

visited several of the Saints in the city,<br/>

an interview with Brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|A. P. Rock-<br/>
wood]], who had been cast into prison on<br/>
the plea of debt, in order to trouble and <br/>
distress him, because he was a Mormon. <br/>
This was the first time we had ever met. <br/>
The jailor permitted me to enter the <br/>
room where he was. It was the first time<br/>
in my life I had ever entered a prison. <br/>
The jailor turned the key upon us and <br/>
locked us both in.</p>

the faith of the gospel. He had the <br/>

ing and <i>[[The Evening and the Morning Star|Evening and Morning Star]]</i> as <br/>

of many things which had transpired <br/>
while he was confined there as a prisoner.<br/>
Among other things, he mentioned that <br/>
the jail had taken fire a few days previous <br/>
to my visit. He said it looked a little<br/>
like a dark hour. The fire was roaring<br/>
over his head, while uproar and confu-<br/>
sion were upon every hand. Fire engines <br/>
were rapidly playing around the build-<br/>
ing, with water pouring into every room.<br/>
The people were hallooing in the streets.<br/>
Prisoners were begging for mercy's sake<br/>
to be let out, or they would be consumed<br/>
in the fire. One was struggling in the <br/>
agonies of death, while others were</p>

cursing and swearing. Brother Rock-<br/>
wood said he felt composed in the midst <br/>
of it until the fire was extinguished.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the jailor unlocked the<br/>
prison door to let me out, and I gave<br/>
the parting hand to the prisoner of hope.</p>

<p>We had spent a pleasant time together,<br/>

would not, to meet with a friend in a<br/>

my uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]], who was <br/>
among the number I had baptized the<br/>

<p>After spending an hour in conversa-<br/>

On the <time datetime=""",07/01/1838
42659.0,23,1838-07-02,""">1st of July, 1838</time>, one of the <br/>
most interesting events transpired of my<br/>
whole life in the ministry.</p>

<p>When Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] gave me <br/>
my [[patriarchal blessing|patriarchal blessing]], among the many <br/>
wonderful things of my life, he promised <br/>
me that I should bring my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house-<br/>
hold into the [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]], and I <br/>
felt that if ever I obtained the blessing,<br/>
the time had come for me to perform it.</p>

<p>By the help of God, I preached the<br/>
gospel faithfully to my father's house-<br/>
hold and to all that were with him, as <br/>
well as to my other relatives, and I had <br/>
appointed a meeting on Sunday, the 1st <br/>
of July, at my father's home.</p>

<p>My father was believing my testimony, <br/>
as were all in his household, but upon <br/>
this occasion the [[Devil|devil]] was determined<br/>
to hinder the fulfillment of the promise<br/>
of the patriarch unto me.</p>

<p>It seemed as though Lucifer, the son <br/>
of the morning, had gathered together<br/>
the hosts of hell and exerted his powers <br/>
upon us all. Distress overwhelmed the <br/>
whole household, and all were tempted<br/>
to reject the work. And it seemed as<br/>
though the same power would devour<br/>
me. 1 had to take to my bed for an <br/>
hour before the time of meeting. I there <br/>
prayed unto the Lord with my whole<br/>
soul for deliverance, for I knew the<br/>
power of the devil was exercised to hin-<br/>
der me from accomplishing what God<br/>
had promised me.</p>

<p>The Lord heard my prayer and an-<br/>
swered my petition, and when the hour<br/>
of meeting had come I arose from my <br/>
bed, and could sing and shout for joy to <br/>
think I had been delivered from the<br/>
power of the evil one.</p>

<p>Filled with the [[power of God|power of God]], I stood <br/>
up in the midst of the congregation and <br/>
preached the gospel of Jesus Christ unto<br/>
the people in great plainness.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting we assem-<br/>
bled on the banks of the [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington<br/>
River]], ""because there was much water<br/>
there,"" and I led six of my friends into <br/>
the river and baptized them for the [[remission of sins|re-<br/>
mission]] of their sins.</p>

<p>All of my father's household were in-<br/>
cluded in this number, according to the<br/>
promise of the [[Patriarch|Patriarch]]. They were<br/>
all relatives except [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]], who <br/>
was a [[Methodist|Methodist]] class-leader and was <br/>
boarding with my father's family.</p>

<p>I organized the small number of nine</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
persons, eight of whom were my relatives, <br/>
into a branch of the Church, and or-<br/>
dained Dwight Webster to the office of a <br/>
[[Priest|priest]] and administered the [[sacrament|sacrament]]<br/>
unto them.</p>

<p>It was truly a day of joy to my soul. <br/>
My father, [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]], and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] were<br/>
among the number baptized. I after-<br/>
wards added a number of relatives. I<br/>
felt that this day's work alone amply re-<br/>
paid me for all my labors in the min-<br/>
istry.</p>

<p>Now, as my mission to my native land <br/>
was accomplished, which I felt im-<br/>
pressed to take while I was upon the<br/>
[[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|islands]], I felt it my duty to return here.</p>

<p>Monday, <time datetime=""",07/02/1838
42659.0,23,1838-07-03,""">July 2nd, 1838</time>, was the last <br/>
day and night I spent at my father's<br/>
home while upon this mission. At the<br/>
setting of the sun I took the last walk <br/>
with my sister I ever had with her while <br/>
in my native State. We walked by the<br/>
canal and viewed the river and the <br/>
fields, and conversed upon our future<br/>
destiny.</p>

<p>After evening prayer with the family, <br/>
my father retired to rest, and I spent a <br/>
season with my stepmother, who had <br/>
reared me from my infancy. In conver-<br/>
sation we felt sensibly the weight of the <br/>
power of temptation, out of which the <br/>
Lord had delivered us.</p>

<p>I also spent a short time with my sis-<br/>
ter Eunice, the only sister I was ever <br/>
blessed with in my father's family. I <br/>
had baptized her into the Church and<br/>
Kingdom of God, and we mingled our<br/>
sympathies, prayers, and tears together<br/>
before the throne of grace.</p>

<p>How truly are the bonds of consan-<br/>
guinity and of the [[blood of Christ|blood of Christ]] united <br/>
in binding the hearts of the Saints of<br/>
God together, and ""how blessings <br/>
brighten as they take their flight.""</p>

<p>This being the last night I was to <br/>
spend beneath my father's roof while <br/>
upon this mission, I felt the weight of it, <br/>
and my prayer was, ""O, Lord, protect<br/>
my father's house, and bring him to <br/>
Zion!"" (which prayer was granted.)</p>

<p>The substance of this letter had been<br/>
revealed to me several weeks before, but<br/>
I had not named it to any person.</p>

<p>The time having now come for me to<br/>
prepare for leaving the islands, I had a <br/>
desire to take with me all the Saints I <br/>
could get to go to Zion. There had al-<br/>
ready been a line drawn upon the islands<br/>
between the Saints and those who had <br/>
rejected the gospel, and the enemies<br/>
were very bitter against me and the [[work of God|work<br/>
of God]] I had labored to establish. They <br/>
threatened my life, but the Saints were <br/>
willing to stand by me.</p>

<p>I spent four days with the Saints visit-<br/>
ing them, holding meetings and encour-<br/>
aging them, while the devil was raging <br/>
upon every hand.</p>

<p>I had baptized and organized into the <br/>
Church nearly one hundred persons while<br/>
upon the islands, and there seemed a <br/>
prospect of gathering about half of them <br/>
with me, but the devil raged to such an <br/>
extent that quite a number were terri-<br/>
fied.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the islands had but<br/>
little acquaintance with the management<br/>
of horses or wagons; in fact, most of<br/>
them knew more about handling a shark<br/>
than a horse. However, in company <br/>
with [[Nathaniel Thomas|Nathanial Thomas]], who had sold<br/>
his property and had money, I went to<br/>
the mainland and purchased ten new <br/>
wagons, ten sets of harness and twenty<br/>
horses. When I got everything prepared</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
for the company to start, I left the affairs <br/>
with Brother Thomas, and went on ahead <br/>
of the company to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]], to prepare <br/>
my own family for the journey.</p>

<p>The outfit which I purchased for the <br/>
company cost about two thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Before leaving Brother Thomas, I coun-<br/>
selled him in regard to the course to pur-<br/>
sue, and charged him not to be later<br/>
than the 1st of September in starting<br/>
from the mainland.</p>

<p>I arrived at Father Carter's on the <time datetime=""",08/19/1838

was also very sick.</p>

fail, and in the afternoon, about four <br/>
o'clock, she appeared to be struck with <br/>
death. I stopped my team, and it <br/>
seemed as though she would breath her<br/>
last lying in the wagon. Two of the <br/>
sisters sat beside her, to see if they could<br/>
do anything for her in her last moments.</p>

<p>1 stood upon the ground, in deep af-<br/>
fliction, and meditated. I cried unto<br/>
the Lord, and prayed that she might live<br/>
and not be taken from me. I claimed the<br/>
promises the Lord had made unto me <br/>
through the prophets and patriarchs, and<br/>
soon her spirit revived, and I drove a <br/>
short distance to a tavern, and got her<br/>
into a room and worked over her and her<br/>

<p>In the morning the circumstances were <br/>
such that I was under the necessity of <br/>
removing my wife from the inn, as there<br/>
was so much noise and confusion at the <br/>
place that she could not endure it. I<br/>
carried her out to her bed in the wagon<br/>
and drove two miles, when I alighted at <br/>
a house and carried my wife and her bed <br/>
into it, with a determination to tarry<br/>
there until she recovered her health or<br/>

but a short time to live.</p>

I spent the day in taking care of her, <br/>

seemed to be gradually sinking, and in<br/>
the evening the spirit apparently left her <br/>
body, and she was dead.</p>

<p>The sisters gathered around her body,<br/>
weeping, while I stood looking at her in<br/>
sorrow. The [[spirit of God|spirit]] and [[power of God|power of God]] <br/>
began to rest upon me until, for the first<br/>
time during her sickness, faith filled my<br/>
soul, although she lay before me as one <br/>
dead.</p>

<p>I had some [[consecrated oil|oil]] that was consecrated<br/>
for my anointing while in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. I <br/>
took it and consecrated it again before<br/>
the Lord for anointing the sick. I then<br/>
bowed down before the Lord and prayed<br/>
for the life of my companion, and I <br/>
anointed her body with the oil in the<br/>
name of the Lord. I laid my hands<br/>
upon her, and in the name of Jesus <br/>
Christ I rebuked the power of death and<br/>
the destroyer, and commanded the same<br/>
to depart from her and the [[spirit of life|spirit of life]]<br/>

her spirit left her body, and she saw it <br/>

and upon her babe, and, while gazing<br/>
upon this scene, two personages came<br/>
into the room, carrying a coffin, and told<br/>
her they had come for her body. One<br/>

could have the privilege of returning to<br/>

CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>ORDAINED TO THE APOSTLESHIP—MY MIS-<br/>
SION TO [[England|ENGLAND]].</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], the Prophet, asked the<br/>
Lord what His will was concerning the<br/>
Twelve, and the Lord answered in a <br/>
revelation, given <time datetime=""",07/08/1838

He says: ""Let them take leave of my <br/>

be officially notified of their appoint-<br/>
ment.'""</p>

<p>It will be observed that this differs<br/>
from nearly all other revelations in this <br/>
respect: a fixed day and a stated place<br/>
were given for the commencement of <br/>
the mission. When the revelation was<br/>
given, all was peace and quietude in Far<br/>
West, Missouri, the city where most of <br/>
the [[Latter-day Saints|Latter day Saints]] dwelt; but before <br/>
the time came for its fulfillment, the<br/>
Saints of God had been driven out of <br/>
the State of Missouri into the State of<br/>
[[Illinois|Illinois]], under the edict of Governor <br/>
[[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]; and the Missourians had sworn<br/>
that if all the other revelations of Joseph<br/>
Smith were fulfilled, that should not be. <br/>
It stated the day and the place where the<br/>
Twelve Apostles should take leave of the<br/>
Saints, to go on their missions across the <br/>
great waters, and the mobocrats of Mis-<br/>
souri had declared that they would see <br/>
that it should not be fulfilled.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the Lord, having<br/>
a foreknowledge of what would take <br/>
place, had given the revelation in this<br/>
manner to see whether the Apostles <br/>
would obey it at the risk of their lives.</p>

<p>When the time drew near for the ful-<br/>
fillment of this commandment of the <br/>
Lord, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] was the President <br/>
of the Twelve Apostles; [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B.<br/>
Marsh]], who was the senior Apostle, had <br/>
fallen. Brother Brigham called together<br/>
those of the Twelve who were then at <br/>
[[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], Illinois, to see what their minds <br/>
would be about going to Far West, to<br/>
fulfill the revelation. The Prophet Jos-</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
eph and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rig-<br/>
don]], [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>
were in prison in Missouri at the time; <br/>
but Father [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], the [[Patriarch|Patriarch]],<br/>
was at Quincy, Illinois. He and others <br/>
who were present did not think it wis-<br/>
dom for us to attempt the journey, as <br/>
our lives would be in great jeopardy. <br/>
They thought the Lord would take the<br/>
will for the deed. But when President <br/>
Young asked the Twelve what our feel-<br/>
ings were upon the subject, we all of us, <br/>
as the voice of one man, said the Lord <br/>
God had spoken, and it was for us to <br/>
obey. It was the Lord's business to take<br/>
care of His servants, and we would ful-<br/>
fill the commandment, or die trying.</p>

<p>To fully understand the risk the<br/>
Twelve ran in making this journey, my<br/>
readers should remember that Lilburn <br/>
W. Boggs, governor of the State of Mis-<br/>
souri, had issued a proclamation, in <br/>
which all the Latter-day Saints were re-<br/>
quired to leave that State or be exter-<br/>
minated. Far West had been captured <br/>
by the militia, who were really only an<br/>
organized mob; the citizens had been<br/>
compelled to give up their arms; all the <br/>
leading men who could be got hold of<br/>
had been taken prisoners; the rest of <br/>
the Saints—men, women and children— <br/>
had to flee as best they could out of the <br/>
State to save their lives, leaving all their <br/>
houses, lands and other property which <br/>
they could not carry with them to be <br/>
taken by the mob. In fact they shot <br/>
down the cattle and hogs of the Saints <br/>
wherever they could find them, and <br/>
robbed them of nearly everything they<br/>
could lay their hands upon. Latter-day<br/>
Saints were treated with merciless cruelty <br/>
and had to endure the most outrageous <br/>
abuses. It was with the greatest diffi-<br/>
culty that many of them got out of the <br/>
State, especially the prominent men; for<br/>
there were many men of that State at <br/>
that time, who acted as though they <br/>
thought it no more harm to shoot a <br/>
Mormon than a mad dog. From this <br/>
brief explanation you will be able to un-<br/>
derstand why some of the brethren <br/>
thought we were not required to go back <br/>
to Far West to start from there upon our<br/>
mission across the ocean to Europe.</p>

notwithstanding that ten thousand of the<br/>

by the edict of the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|governor]], and though <br/>
the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his brother, [[Hyrum Smith|Hy-<br/>

backs on Far West and Missouri, and<br/>
returned to Illinois. We had accom-<br/>

<p>We crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] on the<br/>

<p>There was an incident connected with<br/>
our journey that is worthy of record.</p>

<p>While we were on our way to fulfill <br/>
the revelation, Joseph, the Prophet, and<br/>
his companions in chains had been liber-<br/>
ated, through the blessings of God, from<br/>
their enemies and prison, and they passed<br/>
us. We were not far distant from each <br/>
other, but neither party knew it. They <br/>
were making their way to their families<br/>
in Illinois, while we were traveling to <br/>
Far West into the midst of our enemies.<br/>
So they came home to their families and <br/>
friends before our return.</p>

<p><time datetime=""",05/03/1839

to me, as well as to others. In company<br/>
with five others of the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve, I rode four miles out of town to<br/>
Mr. [[John Cleveland|Cleveland's]], to visit Brother Joseph <br/>
Smith and his family.</p>

<p>Once more I had the happy privilege <br/>
of taking Brother Joseph by the hand. <br/>
Two years had rolled away since I had <br/>
seen his face. He greeted us with great <br/>
joy, as did Hyrum Smith and [[Lyman Wight|Lyman <br/>

their imprisonment together. They had <br/>
been confined in prison six months, and <br/>
had been under sentence of death three <br/>
times; yet their lives were in the [[hands of God|hands <br/>

and they were now mingling with their<br/>

our rejoicing was great.</p>

<p>After spending the day together, we<br/>
returned to our families at night.</p>

<p>On the day following, <time datetime=""",05/04/1839

met in conference at [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], the Prophet<br/>

and rejoicing to all the Saints.</p>

<p>On Sunday, <time datetime=""",05/05/1839

addressed the assembly, followed by<br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] and the Twelve Apostles.<br/>
The [[Spirit of the Lord|Spirit of the Lord]] was poured out<br/>

<p>On <time datetime=""",05/06/1839
42659.0,29,1839-05-15,""">May 6th</time>, I met with the [[Seventies|Seventies]],<br/>
and we ordained sixty men into the <br/>
quorums of [[Elders|elders]] and seventies. Brother <br/>
Joseph met with the Twelve, [[Bishops|bishops]] and<br/>
elders, at Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge's]] house; and<br/>
there were a number with us who were <br/>
wounded at [[Haun|Haun's Mill]]. Among them <br/>
was [[Isaac Laney|Isaac Laney]], who had been in com-<br/>
pany with about twenty others, at the<br/>
mill, when a large armed mob fired <br/>
among them with rifles and other <br/>
weapons, and shot down seventeen of the <br/>
brethren, and wounded more. Brother <br/>
Laney fled from the scene, but they<br/>
poured a shower of lead after him, which<br/>
pierced his body through and through. <br/>
He showed me eleven bullet holes in his<br/>
body. There were twenty-seven in his<br/>
shirt, seven in his pantaloons, and his<br/>
coat was literally cut to pieces. One<br/>
ball entered one arm-pit and came out<br/>
at the other.</p>

<p>Another entered his back and came <br/>
out at the breast. A ball passed through<br/>
each hip, each leg and each arm. All <br/>
these shots were received while he was <br/>
running for life, and, strange as it may <br/>
appear, though he had also one of his<br/>
ribs broken, he was able to outrun his<br/>
enemies, and his life was saved. We <br/>
can only acknowledge this deliverance <br/>
to be by the [[Power of God|power]] and mercy of God.</p>

<p>President [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] was also<br/>
among the number. He also fled, and<br/>
although the balls flew around him like<br/>
hail, he was not wounded. How myste-<br/>
rious are the ways of the Lord!</p>

<p>Before starting on our missions to<br/>
[[England|England]], we were under the necessity<br/>
of settling our families. A place called<br/>
[[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]], afterwards named [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], <br/>
was selected as the place at which our<br/>
people should settle.</p>

<p>I left Quincy, in company with</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>

on the <time datetime=""",05/15/1839
42659.0,29,1839-05-18,""">15th of May</time>, and arrived in <br/>
Commerce on the <time datetime=""",05/18/1839
42659.0,29,1839-07-22,""">18th</time>. After an inter-<br/>
view with Joseph we crossed the river at <br/>
[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]], Iowa. President Brigham <br/>
Young and myself, with our families, <br/>
occupied one room about fourteen feet <br/>
square. Finally Brother Young obtained<br/>
another room and moved into it by him-<br/>
self. Then Brother [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and <br/>
family moved into the same room with <br/>
myself and family.</p>

<p>While I was living in this cabin in the<br/>
old barracks, we experienced a day of <br/>
God's power with the Prophet Joseph.<br/>
It was a very sickly time and Joseph had<br/>
given up his home in Commerce to the<br/>
sick, and had a tent pitched in his door-<br/>
yard and was living in that himself. <br/>
The large number of Saints who had<br/>
been driven out of Missori, were flock-<br/>
ing into Commerce; but had no homes <br/>
to go into, and were living in wagons,<br/>
in tents, and on the ground. Many, <br/>
therefore, were sick through the ex-<br/>
posure they were subjected to. Bro-<br/>
ther Joseph had waited on the sick,<br/>
until he was worn out and nearly sick<br/>
himself.</p>

<p>On the morning of the <time datetime=""",07/22/1839
42659.0,29,,""">22nd of July,<br/>
1839</time>, he arose reflecting upon the sit-<br/>
uation of the Saints of God in their<br/>
persecutions and afflictions, and he <br/>
called upon the Lord in prayer, and the<br/>
[[power of God|power of God]] rested upon him mightily,<br/>
and as Jesus healed all the sick around<br/>
Him in His day, so Joseph, the Prophet<br/>
of God, healed all around on this occa-<br/>
sion. He healed all in his house and<br/>
door-yard, then, in company with Sidney<br/>
Rigdon and several of the Twelve, he <br/>
went through among the sick lying on<br/>
the bank of the river, and he com-<br/>
manded them in a loud voice, in the<br/>
name of Jesus Christ, to come up and <br/>
be made whole, and they were all healed.<br/>
When he healed all that were sick on <br/>
the east side of the river, they crossed<br/>
the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] in a ferry-boat to<br/>
the west side, to Montrose, where we <br/>
were. The first house they went into <br/>
was President Brigham Young's. He<br/>
was sick on his bed at the time. The<br/>
Prophet went into his house and healed<br/>
him, and they all came out together.<br/>
As they were passing by my door, Brother<br/>
Joseph said: ""Brother Woodruff, fol-<br/>
low me."" These were the only words </p>",

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
spoken by any of the company from the <br/>
time they left Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham's]] house<br/>
till we crossed the public square, and <br/>
entered Brother [[Elijah Fordham|Fordham's]] house. Bro-<br/>
ther Fordham had been dying for an<br/>
hour, and we expected each minute<br/>
would be his last.</p>

<p>I felt the [[power of God|power of God]] that was<br/>
overwhelming His [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]].</p>

<p>When we entered the house, Brother <br/>
Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham,<br/>
and took him by the right hand; in his<br/>
left hand he held his hat.</p>

<p>He saw that Brother Fordham's eyes<br/>
were glazed, and that he was speechless <br/>
and unconscious.</p>

<p>After taking hold of his hand, he <br/>
looked down into the dying man's face<br/>
and said: ""Brother Fordham do you<br/>
not know me?"" At first he made no <br/>
reply; but we could all see the effect of <br/>
the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]] resting upon him.</p>

<p>He again said: ""Elijah, do you not<br/>
know me?""</p>

<p>With a low whisper, Brother Ford-<br/>
ham answered, ""Yes!""</p>

<p>The Prophet then said, ""Have you <br/>
not faith to be healed?""</p>

<p>The answer, which was a little plainer<br/>
than before, was: ""I am afraid it is too<br/>
late. If you had come sooner, I think<br/>
it might have been.""</p>

<p>He had the appearance of a man wak-<br/>
ing from sleep. It was the sleep of <br/>
death.</p>

<p>Joseph then said: ""Do you believe<br/>
that Jesus is the Christ?""</p>

<p>""I do, Brother Joseph,"" was the re-<br/>
ponse.</p>

<p>Then the Prophet of God spoke with<br/>
a loud voice, as in the majesty of the <br/>
Godhead: ""Elijah, I command you, in<br/>
the name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise<br/>
and be made whole!''</p>

<p>The words of the Prophet were not <br/>
like the words of man, but like the [[voice of God|voice<br/>
of God]]. It seemed to me that the<br/>
house shook from its foundation.</p>

<p>Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed <br/>
like a man raised from the dead. A <br/>
healthy color came to his face, and life <br/>
was manifested in every act.</p>

<p>His feet were done up in Indian meal <br/>
[[poultices|poultices]]. He kicked them off his feet, <br/>
scattered the contents, and then called <br/>
for his clothes and put them on. He<br/>
asked for a bowl of bread and milk, and<br/>
ate it; then put on his hat and followed</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
us into the street, to visit others who<br/>
were sick.</p>

<p>The unbeliever may ask: ""Was there <br/>
not deception in this?""</p>

<p>If there is any deception in the mind <br/>
of the unbeliever, there was certainly <br/>
none with Elijah Fordham, the dying <br/>
man, nor with those who were present<br/>
with him, for in a few minutes he would<br/>
have been in the [[spirit world|spirit world]], had he <br/>
not been rescued. Through the bless-<br/>
ing of God, he lived up till 1880, in <br/>
which year he died in [[Utah Territory|Utah]], while all <br/>
who were with him on that occasion,<br/>
with the exception of one, are in the<br/>
[[spirit world|spirit world]].</p>

<p>Among the number were Joseph and <br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], Brigham<br/>
Young, [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[George Albert Smith|George A. <br/>
Smith]], [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]. <br/>
Wilford Woodruff is the only one living <br/>
who was present at that time, and he <br/>
will soon mingle with those who have<br/>
gone.</p>

<p>As soon as we left Brother Fordham's<br/>
house, we went into the house of [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph<br/>
B. Noble]], who was very low and danger-<br/>
ously sick.</p>

<p>When we entered the house, Brother<br/>
Joseph took him by the hand, and com-<br/>
manded him, in the name of Jesus<br/>
Christ, to arise and be made whole. <br/>
He did arise and was immediately<br/>
healed.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the wicked<br/>
mob in the place, led by one [[David Wells Kilbourne|Kilburn]],<br/>
had become alarmed, and followed us <br/>
into Brother Noble's house.</p>

<p>Before they arrived there, Brother <br/>
Joseph had called upon Brother Ford-<br/>
ham to offer prayer.</p>

<p>While he was praying, the mob en-<br/>
tered, with all the [[evil spirits|evil spirits]] accom-<br/>
panying them.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered, Brother <br/>
Fordham, who was praying, fainted and <br/>
sank to the floor.</p>

<p>When Joseph saw the mob in the<br/>
house, he arose and had the room cleared<br/>
of both that class of men and their at-<br/>
tendant devils. Then Brother Fordham<br/>
immediately revived and finished his <br/>
prayer.</p>

<p>This case of Brother Noble's was the<br/>
last one of healing upon that day. It <br/>
was greatest day for the manifestation of<br/>

healing since the organization of the <br/>
Church.</p>

<p>When we left Brother [[Joseph Bates Noble|Noble]], the<br/>
Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Jeseph]] went, with those who <br/>
accompanied him from the other side to<br/>
the banks of the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]], to return home.</p>

<p>While waiting for the ferry-boat, a<br/>
man of the world, knowing of the mir-<br/>
acles which had been performed, came<br/>
to him and asked him if he would not <br/>
go and heal two twin children of his<br/>
about five months old, who were both<br/>
lying sick nigh unto death.</p>

<p>They were some two miles from [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Mon-<br/>
trose]].</p>

<p>The Prophet said he could not go;<br/>
but, after pausing some time, he said <br/>
he would send some one to heal them;<br/>
and he turned to me and said: ""You go <br/>
with the man and heal his children.""</p>

<p>He took a red silk handkerchief out <br/>
of his pocket and gave it to me, and <br/>
told me to wipe their faces with the <br/>
handkerchief when I administered to <br/>
them, and they should be healed. He<br/>
also said unto me: ""As long as you will<br/>
keep that handkerchief, it shall remain<br/>
a league between you and me.''</p>

<p>I went with the man, and did as the<br/>
Prophet commanded me, and the chil-<br/>
dren were healed.</p>

<p>I have possession of the handkerchief <br/>
unto this day.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",07/01/1839
42659.0,31,,""">first of July, 1839</time>, Joseph<br/>
Smith and his counselors, [[Sidney Rigdon|Sydney Rig-<br/>
don]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], crossed the river <br/>
to Montrose, to spend the day with the <br/>
Twelve, and [[set apart|set them apart]] and [[priesthood blessing|bless]] <br/>
them, before they started upon their<br/>
missions. There were twelve of us who <br/>
met there, and we all dined in my <br/>
house.</p>

<p>After dinner, we assembled at Brother <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]] house for our meeting.</p>

<p>Brother Hyrum Smith opened by <br/>
prayer; after which the Presidency [[laying on of hands|laid<br/>
their hands]] upon our heads and gave<br/>
each of us a blessing.</p>

<p>President Rigdon was mouth in bless-<br/>
ing me, and also blessed Sisters [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]], <br/>
[[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]].</p>

<p>The prophet Joseph promised us if we <br/>
would be faithful, we should be blessed<br/>
upon our mission, have many souls as <br/>
seals of our ministry, and return again<br/>
in peace and safety to our families and<br/>
friends; all of which was fulfilled.</p>

<p>Brother Hyrum advised me to preach</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
the first principles of the gospel; he<br/>
thought that was about as much as this<br/>
generation could endure.</p>

<p>Then Joseph arose and preached some <br/>
precious things of the [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]] <br/>
unto us, in the power of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]]; <br/>
some of which I here copy from my <br/>
journal:</p>

<p>""Ever keep in exercise the principle <br/>
of mercy, and be ready to forgive our <br/>
brethren on the first intimation of their<br/>
repentance and desire for forgiveness;<br/>
for our [[Heavenly Father|Heavenly Father]] will be equally<br/>
as merciful unto us. We also ought to <br/>
be willing to repent of and confess our <br/>
sins, and keep nothing back. Let the <br/>
Twelve be humble and not be exalted,<br/>
and beware of pride and not seek to ex-<br/>
cel one another, but act for each other's<br/>
good, and honorably make mention of <br/>
each other's names in prayer before the <br/>
Lord and before your fellow-men. Do <br/>
not backbite or devour a brother. The <br/>
[[Elders of Israel|elders of Israel]] should seek to learn by<br/>
precept and example in this late age of<br/>
the world and not be obliged to learn <br/>
everything we know by sad experience. <br/>
I trust the remainder of the Twelve will<br/>
learn wisdom and not follow the example<br/>
of those who have fallen. When the <br/>
Twelve, or any other witnesses of Jesus<br/>
Christ, stand before the congregations<br/>
of the earth, and they preach in the <br/>
power and demonstration of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy <br/>
Ghost]], and the people are astonished<br/>
and confounded at the doctrine, and say<br/>
'That man has preached a powerful ser-<br/>

tray your friend.""</p>

<p>The foregoing are some of the instruc-<br/>
tions given to the Twelve by the Prophet<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], before they started upon their<br/>
missions.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the devil had been in a<br/>
measure thwarted by the Twelve going<br/>
to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and returning without<br/>
harm, it seemed as though the destroyer <br/>
was determined to make some other at-<br/>
tempt upon us to hinder us from per-<br/>
forming our missions; for it seemed that <br/>
as soon as any one of the Apostles began <br/>
to prepare for starting, he was smitten <br/>
with chills and fever or sickness of some<br/>
kind.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the quorum of the<br/>
Twelve or their families began to be<br/>
sick, so it still required the exercise of a<br/>
good deal of faith and perseverance to<br/>
start off on a mission.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",07/25/1839
42659.0,32,1839-08-07,""">25th of July</time>, for the first time<br/>
in my life, I was attacked with chills and <br/>
fever; and this I had every other day,<br/>
and, whenever attacked, I was laid pros-<br/>
trate.</p>

<p>My wife, [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phoebe]], was also soon taken <br/>
down with the chills and fever, as were <br/>
quite a number of the Twelve.</p>

<p>I passed thirteen days in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] <br/>
with my family, after I was taken sick, <br/>
before I started on my mission.</p>

<p>The <time datetime=""",08/07/1839
42659.0,32,1839-08-08,""">7th of August</time> was the last day I <br/>
spent at home in Montrose, and although<br/>
sick with the chills and fever the most of<br/>
the day, I made what preparations I</p>

could to start on the morrow on a mis-<br/>
sion of four thousand miles, to preach <br/>
the gospel to the nations of the earth,<br/>
and this, too, without purse or scrip, <br/>
with disease resting upon me, and a<br/>
stroke of fever and ague once every two <br/>
days.</p>

<p>Early upon the morning of the <time datetime=""",08/08/1839
42659.0,32,,""">8th of <br/>
August</time>, I arose from my bed of sickness, <br/>
[[laying on of hands|laid my hands]] upon the head of my <br/>
sick wife, Phoebe, and blessed her. I <br/>
then departed from the embrace of my<br/>
companion, and left her almost without<br/>
food or the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>She parted from me with the fortitude<br/>
that becomes a Saint, realizing the re-<br/>
sponsibilities of her companion. I quote<br/>
from my journal:</p>

<p>""Phoebe, farewell! Be of good cheer; <br/>
remember me in your prayers. I leave <br/>
these pages for your perusal when I am <br/>
gone. I shall see thy face again in the<br/>
flesh. I go to obey the commands of<br/>
Jesus Christ.""</p>

<p>Although feeble, I walked to the<br/>
banks of the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]]. There <br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] took me in a canoe<br/>
(having no other conveyance) and pad-<br/>
dled me across the river.</p>

<p>When we landed, I lay down on a<br/>
side of sole leather, by the post office, <br/>
to rest.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph, the Prophet of God, <br/>
came along and looked at me.</p>

<p>""Well, Brother Woodruff,"" said he,<br/>
""you have started upon your mission.""</p>

<p>""Yes,"" said I, ""but I feel and look <br/>
more like a subject for the dissecting<br/>
room than a missionary.""</p>

<p>Joseph replied: ""What did you say<br/>
that for? Get up, and go along; all <br/>
will be right with you!""</p>

<p>I name these incidents that the reader <br/>
may know how the brethren of the<br/>
Twelve Apostles started upon their mis-<br/>
sions to [[England|England]], in 1839.</p>

<p>Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] was going with me,<br/>
and we were the first two of the quorum<br/>
of the Twelve who started on their<br/>
mission.</p>

<p>Brother Taylor was about the only <br/>
man in the quorum that was not sick.</p>

<p>Soon a brother came along with a<br/>
wagon, and took us in. As we were <br/>
driving through the place, we came to<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]], who was stripped to the<br/>
shirt and pants with his head and feet</p>",

bare. [[Parley Parker Pratt|He]] was hewing a log, preparing<br/>
to build a cabin.</p>

<p>He said: ""Brother Woodruff, I have <br/>
no money, but I have an empty purse,<br/>
which I will give you.<sup>.</sup>' He brought it <br/>
to me, and I thanked him for it.</p>

<p>We went a few rods further, and met<br/>
Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], in the same <br/>
condition, also hewing a log, towards <br/>
building a cabin.</p>

<p>He said: ""As Parley has given you a <br/>
purse, I have got a dollar I will give you <br/>
to put in it.""</p>

<p>He gave me both a dollar and a bless-<br/>
ing.</p>

<p>We drove sixteen miles across a prairie, <br/>
and spent the night with a Brother [[Brother Merrill|Mer-<br/>
rill]]. The day following we rode ten <br/>
miles, to a Brother [[Ute Perkins|Perkins']], and he took<br/>
us in his wagon to [[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]], and from<br/>
thence to Brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith's]].</p>

<p>I rode four hours during the day over<br/>
a very rough road of stones and stumps, <br/>
lying on my back in the bottom of the<br/>
wagon, shaking with the ague, and I <br/>
suffered much.</p>

<p>We held a meeting in a grove near <br/>
Don Carlos Smith's, and here Elder <br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] baptized [[George Miller|George Miller]], who <br/>
afterwards was ordained a [[Bishop|bishop]].</p>

<p>At the meeting the Saints gave us nine<br/>
dollars, and George Miller gave us a <br/>
horse to help us on our journey.</p>

<p>I rode to [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] with Father [[John Coltrin|Col-<br/>
trin]], where I had an interview with <br/>
several families of the [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Island]] Saints, <br/>
whom I had brought up with me from <br/>
Fox Islands in 1838. I spent several <br/>
days with them and at [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], where<br/>
Elder Taylor published fifteen hundred <br/>
copies, in pamphlet form, of a brief <br/>
sketch of the persecutions and sufferings<br/>
of the Latter-dav Saints, inflicted by the<br/>
inhabitants of [[Missouri|Missouri]].</p>

<p>We sold our horse, and in company <br/>
with Father Coltrin, Brother Taylor and <br/>
myself left Springfield, and continued<br/>
our journey.</p>

<p>I had the chills and fever nearly every<br/>
other day, which made riding in a lum-<br/>
ber wagon very distressing to me, es-<br/>
pecially when I shook with the ague.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",08/24/1839
42659.0,33,1839-08-28,""">24th of August</time>, we rode to <br/>
[[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]], and spent the night with<br/>
Dr. [[Charles Burns Modesitt|Modisett]]. I suffered much with the<br/>
chills and fever.</p>

<p>Elder John Taylor up to this time had <br/>
appeared to enjoy excellent health, but</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
the destroyer did not intend to make<br/>
him an exception to the rest of the <br/>
Apostles. On the <time datetime=""",08/28/1839
42659.0,33,1839-08-30,""">28th of August</time>, he <br/>
fell to the ground as though he had been<br/>
knocked down. He fainted away, but<br/>
soon revived. On the following day, <br/>
however, the enemy made a powerful <br/>
attack upon his life. He fainted away<br/>
several times, and it seemed as though<br/>
he would die. We stopped several hours <br/>
with him at a house by the wayside. <br/>
We then took him into the wagon and <br/>
drove to [[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|Horace S. Eldredge's]], and <br/>
spent the remainder of the day and night <br/>
doctoring him.</p>

<p>In the morning Brother Taylor was so <br/>
far recovered that he thought he would<br/>
be able to ride. So we started on our <br/>
journey on the morning of the <time datetime=""",08/30/1839
42659.0,33,1839-09-01,""">30th</time>, and <br/>
we traveled forty miles, to [[Louisville, Henry County, Indiana|Louisville]], <br/>
and spent the night with the family of <br/>
Brother [[James Townsend|James Townsend]].</p>

<p>We felt terribly shaken up, being in <br/>
such a weak state. Brother Townsend <br/>
was away from home, but we were kindly<br/>
entertained by Sister [[Susan Davis Townsend|Townsend]].</p>

<p>In the morning Elder Taylor, though <br/>
very weak, felt disposed to continue his<br/>
journey. We traveled fourteen miles to <br/>
[[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]]. He was quite sick at <br/>
night, and the [[bilious fever|bilious fever]] seemed to <br/>
settle upon him. I was also very feeble, <br/>
myself.</p>

<p>On the day following, <time datetime=""",09/01/1839
42659.0,33,1839-09-02,""">September 1st</time>, <br/>
being Sunday, Brother Taylor concluded<br/>
to remain there for the day, and hold a<br/>
meeting.</p>

<p>It was a German settlement. He <br/>
wished me to speak, and I spoke upon <br/>
the first principles of the gospel. He <br/>
followed me, and spoke until he was ex-<br/>
hausted.</p>

<p>After we returned to the inn where we <br/>
were stopping, I was taken with a chill <br/>
and fever, and had a very bad night. <br/>
Brother Taylor was also very sick.</p>

<p>The following day, <time datetime=""",09/02/1839
42659.0,33,,""">September 2nd</time>, was <br/>
a painful day to my feelings. It was <br/>
evident that Brother Taylor had a settled <br/>
fever upon him, and would not be able <br/>
to travel.</p>

<p>Father Coltrin was resolved to con-<br/>
tinue his journey, and, in conversing <br/>
with Brother Taylor, he thought it better <br/>
for one sick man to be left than for two, <br/>
as I was so sick with the chills and fever <br/>
that I was not able to render him any <br/>
assistance, nor, indeed, to take care of </p>",

Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] advised me to continue <br/>
my journey with Brother [[John Coltrin|Coltrin]], and <br/>
make the best of my way to [[New York|New York]].</p>

<p>After committing Elder Taylor into<br/>
the hands of the Lord, though painful <br/>
to me, I gave him the parting hand and<br/>
started. I left him in [[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]], <br/>
Wayne County, Indiana, in the hand sof<br/>
a merciful God and a kind and benevo-<br/>
lent family, who promised to do every-<br/>
thing in their power to make him com-<br/>
fortable until his recovery.</p>

<p>This they did, though he passed <br/>
through a severe course of the [[bilious fever|billious<br/>
fever]], and was sick nigh unto death.<br/>
Through the mercy of God, however, <br/>
he recovered from his sickness, and con-<br/>
tinued his journey. We next met in the <br/>
City of [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]].</p>

<p>I continued my journey with Father <br/>
Coltrin, and we reached [[Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cleveland]] on<br/>
the <time datetime=""",09/18/1839
42659.0,34,1839-09-21,""">18th of September</time>. We there took<br/>
steamer for [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]], but were three days <br/>
and a night in a storm before we made <br/>
the harbor. We landed at midnight, <br/>
and in doing so we ran into a schooner, <br/>
and stove it in.</p>

<p>From Buffalo I traveled to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]] in <br/>
a canal boat, and had a stroke of the <br/>
ague daily.</p>

<p>While on my journey, at Albany, I <br/>
took a stage in the night, and rode to<br/>
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] home in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], on the<br/>

isted there upon this occasion, as I found <br/>
them all strong in the faith of the gos-<br/>

<p>I was still suffering with the ague<br/>
daily.</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
was believing. I had also been associated <br/>
with him from my youth up.</p>

<p>On his death-bed he sent me a request <br/>
that I would preach his funeral sermon.<br/>
I was having the chills and fever<br/>
daily at the time, attended with a very <br/>
severe cough, so much so, that my father<br/>
thought that I would never leave his <br/>
home alive. But when they brought me<br/>
the request of my dying uncle, and the <br/>
day came for his burial, I told my father<br/>
to get his horse and buggy ready, for I <br/>
was going to attend the funeral.</p>

<p>He thought I was very reckless in re-<br/>
gard to my own life, as I had suffered <br/>
with the chills and fever some fifteen <br/>
days, and to attempt to speak in my <br/>
weak state, and to begin at the same<br/>
hour that my chill was to come on, <br/>
seemed to him foolhardy.</p>

<p>My parents were quite alarmed, yet<br/>
according to my request my father got <br/>
up his team, and I rode with him and <br/>
my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]] five miles, through a <br/>
cold, chilly wind, and I commenced <br/>
speaking to a large congregation, at the<br/>
same hour that my chill had been in the <br/>
habit of coming on.</p>

<p>I spoke over an hour with great free-<br/>

hour, and I had no more attacks for<br/>

<p>While on the ship, a [[Methodist|Methodist]] min-<br/>
ister got into a discussion with some [[Catholic|Cath-<br/>

arguments of the minister ran rather <br/>

<p>Elder Taylor told the Methodist min-<br/>
ister that he did not think it was becom-<br/>
ing in a daughter to find so much fault <br/>
with the mother as they did, for as the <br/>
Methodists came out of the Catholics, <br/>
Elder Taylor thought the mother had as<br/>

molested as the daughter had. That <br/>
ended the argument.</p>

<p>Our company consisted of 109 souls,<br/>

ceived his ordination.</p>

<p>On the day following I parted with<br/>
Elders Taylor and Fielding, who went<br/>
to Liverpool, and with Elder Richards,<br/>
who tarried in Preston. Elder Turley <br/>
and I went to Manchester.</p>

<p>It was the first time I ever visited that <br/>
city. I here first met with Elder Wm. <br/>
Clayton. As soon as I had an introduc-<br/>
tion to him, he informed me that one of <br/>
the sisters in that place was possessed of <br/>
the [[Devil|devil]], and he asked me to go and <br/>
cast it out of her, thinking that one of <br/>
the Twelve Apostles could do anything<br/>
in this line he might wish to.</p>

<p>However, I went with him to the <br/>
house where the woman lay, in the hands <br/>
of three men, in a terrible rage, and <br/>
trying to tear her clothing from her.</p>

<p>I also found quite a number of Saints <br/>
present, and some unbelievers, who had <br/>
come to see the devil cast out and a<br/>
miracle wrought.</p>

<p>If I had acted upon my own judg-<br/>
ment I should not have attempted to ad-<br/>
minister to her with the company pres-<br/>
ent, but as I was a stranger there, and <br/>
Brother Clayton presided over the <br/>
branch, I joined him in administering to <br/>
the woman. But the unbelief of the <br/>
wicked present was so great, we could <br/>
not cast the devil out of her, and she <br/>
raged worse than ever.</p>

<p>I then ordered the room to be cleared, <br/>
and when the company left the house, <br/>
except the few attending to her, we [[laying on of hands|laid <br/>
hands]] upon her, and I commanded the <br/>
devil to come out of her, in the name of <br/>
Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and <br/>
she was entirely cured and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next day being the Sabbath, she <br/>
came before a large congregation of peo-<br/>
ple, and bore testimony to what the <br/>
Lord had done for her. We had a large<br/>
assemblage through the day and evening, <br/>
to whom I preached the gospel.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the devil, not <br/>
being satisfied with being cast out of the<br/>
woman, entered into her little child, <br/>
which was but a few months old.</p>",

<p>In the evening I again met with a large<br/>

[[Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England|Stourbridge]], [[Stourport, Worcestershire, England|Stourport]] and [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]], <br/>
and then walked a number of miles to <br/>
Mr. [[John Benbow|John Benbow's]], [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill Farm]], [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castle <br/>
Frome]], Ledbury, Herefordshire. This <br/>
was a farming country in the south of <br/>
England, a region where no Elder of the<br/>
Latter-day Saints had visited.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthy <br/>
farmer, cultivating three hundred acres<br/>
of land, occupying a good mansion, and<br/>
having plenty of means. His wife, [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Jane]], <br/>
had no children.</p>

<p>I presented myself to him as a mission-<br/>
ary from America, an Elder of the <br/>
[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day <br/>
Saints]], who had been sent to him by the <br/>
commandment of God as a messenger of <br/>
salvation, to preach the gospel of life <br/>
unto him and his household, and the in-<br/>
habitants of the land.</p>

<p>Mr. Benbow and his wife received me <br/>
with glad hearts and thanksgiving. It <br/>
was in the evening when I arrived, hav-<br/>
ing traveled forty-eight miles by coach <br/>
and on foot during the day, but after<br/>
receiving refreshments we sat down to-<br/>

vealed through the mouth of His Prophet,<br/>

<p>I rejoiced greatly at the news that Mr.<br/>
Benbow gave me, that there was a <br/>
company of men and women—over six <br/>
hundred in number—who had broken off <br/>
from the Wesleyan [[Methodist|Methodists]], and taken<br/>
the name of [[United Brethren|United Brethren]]. They <br/>
had forty-five preachers among them, <br/>

land for preaching in.</p>

<p>This body of [[United Brethren|United Brethren]] were<br/>
searching for light and truth, but had <br/>
gone as far as they could, and were con-<br/>
tinually calling upon the Lord to open <br/>
the way before them, and send them <br/>
light and knowledge that they might<br/>
know the true way to be saved.</p>

<p>When I heard these things I could <br/>
clearly see why the Lord had command-<br/>
ed me, while in the town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], to <br/>
leave that place of labor and go to the <br/>
south, for in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] there was a <br/>
great harvest-field for gathering many <br/>
Saints into the [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]].</p>

<p>I retired to my bed with joy after <br/>
offering my prayers and thanksgiving to <br/>
God, and slept sweetly until the rising <br/>
of the sun.</p>

<p>I arose on the morning of the <time datetime=""",03/05/1840

took breakfast, and told Mr. [[John Benbow|Benbow]] I <br/>
would like to commence my Master's <br/>
business, by preaching the gospel to the <br/>
people.</p>

<p>He had a large hall in his mansion <br/>
which was licensed for preaching, and he<br/>
sent word through the neighborhood <br/>
that an American missionary would <br/>
preach at his house that evening.</p>

<p>As the time drew nigh many of the <br/>
neighbors came in, and I preached my<br/>
first gospel sermon in the house. I also <br/>
preached on the following evening at the<br/>
same place, and baptized six persons, <br/>
including Mr. John Benbow and his [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]],<br/>
and four preachers of the [[United Brethren|United Brethren]].</p>

<p>I spent most of the following day in <br/>
clearing out a pool of water, and <br/>
preparing it for baptizing in, as I saw<br/>
many to be baptized there. I afterwards<br/>
baptized six hundred in that pool of <br/>
water.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the <time datetime=""",03/08/1840

[[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]] in the morning, at [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Stand-<br/>
ley Hill]] in the afternoon, and at John <br/>
Benbow's, [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill Farm]], in the evening.</p>

<p>The [[St. Michael and All Angels Parish Church, Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|parish church]] that stood in the <br/>
neighborhood of Brother Benbow's, pre-<br/>
sided over by the [[Henry Fisher|rector]] of the parish, <br/>
was attended during the day by only fif-<br/>
teen persons, while I had a large congre-<br/>
gation, estimated to number a thousand, <br/>
attend my meeting through the day and<br/>
evening.</p>

<p>When I arose in the evening to speak <br/>
at Brother Benbow's house, a man en-<br/>
tered the door and informed me that he</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
was a constable, and had been sent by<br/>
the rector of the parish with a warrant <br/>
to arrest me.</p>

<p>I asked him ""For what crime?""</p>

<p>He said, ""For preaching to the peo-<br/>
ple.""</p>

<p>I told him that I, as well as the rec-<br/>
tor, had a license for preaching the gos-<br/>
pel to the people, and that if he would <br/>
take a chair I would wait upon him after<br/>
meeting.</p>

<p>He took my chair and sat beside me. <br/>
I preached the first principles of the<br/>
everlasting gospel for an hour and a <br/>
quarter. The [[power of God|power of God]] rested upon <br/>
me, the Spirit filled the house, and the <br/>
people were convinced.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting I opened<br/>
a door for baptism, and seven offered<br/>
themselves. Among the number were <br/>
four preachers and the constable.</p>

<p>The latter arose and said, ""Mr. Wood-<br/>
ruff, I would like to be baptized.""</p>

<p>I told him I would like to baptize <br/>
him. I went down to the pool and bap-<br/>
tized the seven. We then met together <br/>
and I confirmed thirteen, and broke <br/>
bread unto the Saints and we all rejoiced <br/>
together.</p>

<p>The constable went to the rector and <br/>
told him if he wanted Mr. Woodruff <br/>
taken up for preaching the gospel, he<br/>
must go himself and serve the writ, for <br/>
he had heard him preach the only true<br/>
gospel sermon he had ever listened to in <br/>
his life.</p>

<p>The rector did not know what to make <br/>
of it, so he sent two clerks of the [[Church of England|Church <br/>
of England]] as spies, to attend our meet-<br/>
ing, and find out what we did preach.</p>

<p>But they were both pricked in their <br/>
hearts and received the [[word of the Lord|word of the <br/>
Lord]] gladly, and were baptized and con-<br/>
firmed members of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus <br/>
Christ of Latter-day Saints]].</p>

<p>The rector became alarmed and did <br/>
not dare to send anybody else.</p>

<p>The ministers and rectors of the South <br/>
of England called a convention and <br/>
sent a petition to the Archbishop of <br/>
[[Canterbury, Kent, England|Canterbury]], to request parliament to<br/>
pass a law prohibiting the Mormons <br/>
from preaching in the British dominion.</p>

<p>In this petition the rector stated that <br/>
one ""Mormon"" missionary had baptized <br/>
fifteen hundred persons, mostly members<br/>
of the English church, during the last <br/>
seven months.</p>",

that if they had the worth of souls at <br/>
heart as much as they had the ground <br/>

would not lose so many of their flock.</p>

<p>I continued to preach and baptize <br/>
daily.</p>

sixty members of the United Brethren, <br/>

forty-five houses, which were licensed <br/>

United Brethren except one person; also <br/>
including some two hundred preachers<br/>

forty-five black marble steps, which<br/>
brought us up two hundred feet into the<br/>

est city in the world, which can boast of <br/>
a history of nearly two thousand years. <br/>
At our feet, as it were, lay a historical <br/>

across in full view and one not seen from<br/>
the Monument, making six. These six <br/>
bridges are fine sights in themselves. <br/>

of the Thames, and our view of them <br/>
from our high pinnacle with their crowds<br/>
of moving and ever changing human <br/>
masses, and cabs, omnibuses, carriages,<br/>
drays, etc., which dash along, presented <br/>
to us a picturesque sight. In addition<br/>
to all this, within our view, was London<br/>
Borough, on the south of the river, and <br/>
all around us hundreds of churches, <br/>
chapels, and spires, standing in the <br/>
midst of one universal mass of buildings,<br/>
covering about six square miles of <br/>

a clear day, we conversed with a Prussian <br/>
traveler, a citizen of Berlin, who had <br/>
traveled much over Europe and [[Asia|Asia]] and<br/>

attended a [[Methodist|Methodist]] meeting in [[Long Lane, London, Middlesex, England|Long <br/>
Lane]].</p>

<p>Next day we again went to the Tem-<br/>
perance Hall, in St. George's Road near <br/>
the Elephant and Castle, and by the re-<br/>
request of the committee I addressed the<br/>
meeting upon the subject of temperance,<br/>
followed by George A Smith. We gave<br/>
out an appointment to [[preach the gospel|preach the Gos-<br/>
pel]] at that place <time datetime=""",09/07/1840
42659.0,40,1840-08-30,""">September 7th</time>.</p>

<p>The day after, we all started out to go<br/>
through the city of London to see if we <br/>
could find a man with the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]],<br/>
and after wandering through the city, <br/>
not knowing whither we went, we came<br/>
upon a man and stopped him and spoke<br/>
to him. Brother Kimball asked him<br/>
if he was a preacher? He said <br/>
he was. He seemed to have a good <br/>
spirit, and informed us that he had been<br/>
to America, and had come to London<br/>
for the purpose of going to [[South Australia, Australia|South Aus-<br/>
tralia]], but had just buried one child and <br/>
another lay at the point of death. Broth-<br/>
er Kimball told him his child should <br/>
live. He gave us some information <br/>
where we could preach. On the same<br/>
day we called upon him and found his <br/>
child better, but he was not at home. <br/>
We then went and heard a Calvinist <br/>
preach, and he gave us an invitation to<br/>
call and see him.</p>

<p>Next day we again went over the city<br/>
to see if we could find any of the [[children of God|chil-<br/>
dren of God]]. We found one man and <br/>
his household who received our testi-<br/>
mony, and he opened his doors for us to <br/>
preach. We appointed a meeting at his <br/>
house for Sunday evening. His name <br/>
was [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]], and he lived at 52 Iron-<br/>
monger Row, St. Luke's Parish, near<br/>
the church.</p>

<p>We had spent twelve days in going to <br/>
and fro through London, trying to find<br/>
a people willing to receive our testi-<br/>
mony, but finding the doors shut against <br/>
us, we determined in the name of God <br/>
to go into the streets and lift up our<br/>
voices.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Elders Kimball, Smith, <br/>
and myself started out on Sunday morn-</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
ing, <time datetime=""",08/30/1840
42659.0,40,,""">August the 30th</time>, walked three miles <br/>
and stopped in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]], Old <br/>
Street, where we found an [[Aitkenite|Aitkenite]] <br/>
preaching to the people, who was fol-<br/>
lowed by a [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]]. Just as the <br/>
latter was about to begin, Elder Kimball<br/>
informed him that there was a preacher<br/>
from America present who would like to<br/>
speak when he got through. The preacher <br/>
then informed the people that there was <br/>
an American minister present, and pro-<br/>
posed that he should speak first. Elder <br/>
George A. Smith then got into the chair,<br/>
and spoke about twenty minutes, and<br/>
then the Presbyterian spoke. George A.<br/>
had informed the people that there were<br/>
two other American preachers present <br/>
who would like to address them, and, <br/>
when the Presbyterian closed, Elder <br/>
Kimball asked him if there would be any <br/>
objection to our preaching there at three<br/>
o'clock. He answered, ""No, not at all. <br/>
What denomination do you belong to?'' <br/>
""To the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-<br/>
ter-day Saints]],"" was the reply.</p>

<p>""Oh, I have heard of them,"" he said.<br/>
""They are a bad people; they have done <br/>
much hurt; they divide churches; we <br/>
don't want to hear you.""</p>

<p>He then mounted the chair again and <br/>
said to the people, ""I have just heard<br/>
that the last man who spoke belongs to<br/>
the Latter-day Saints,"" and he began to<br/>
rail against us.</p>

<p>Elder Kimball asked him to let him <br/>
step into the chair to give out an ap-<br/>
pointment for a 3 o'clock meeting, but<br/>
he would not let him. Brother Kimball <br/>
then raised his voice and informed the<br/>
people that some American preachers <br/>
would preach there at 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>At the appointed time we were at the <br/>
place. The conduct of the preacher and<br/>
the excitement upon the subject brought <br/>
a large congregation to hear us. I <br/>
opened the meeting by singing and<br/>
prayer and spoke about twenty minutes, <br/>
from ##Galatians 1:8-9|Gal. I. 8-9 v.##, and was followed by <br/>
Elder Kimball for about the same length <br/>
of time. The people gave good attention<br/>
and seemed to be much interested in <br/>
what they heard.</p>

<p>After meeting, Mr. Corner invited us<br/>
home; but soon after we arrived, at his <br/>
house, Elder Kimball felt impressed to <br/>
return to the place of preaching. When <br/>
he got there he found a large company <br/>
talking about the things which they had </p>",

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
heard, and they wished [[Heber Chase Kimball|him]] to speak to <br/>
them again. He did so and addressed<br/>
them at considerable length, and after-<br/>
ward several invited him home to their <br/>
houses.</p>

<p>While he was away a man who had <br/>
been a preacher came to Mr. [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]]; <br/>
I gave him a brief account of the great <br/>
[[work of God|work of God]] in the [[last days|last days]] and they <br/>
received the things which I spake unto<br/>
them. Mr. Corner offered himself for <br/>
baptism. This was the first man in the <br/>
city of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] who offered himself for<br/>
the ordinance of the Gospel. We ap-<br/>
pointed the next evening to administer<br/>
the ordinance of baptism unto him.<br/>
After supping with him we returned <br/>
home. I was weary and unwell during<br/>
the night, but felt thankful unto the <br/>
Lord for the privilege of preaching to<br/>
the inhabitants of this great city and to<br/>
have gained one soul as a seal to our <br/>
ministry.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",08/31/1840
42659.0,41,1840-09-02,""">31st of August</time> we reaped the <br/>
first fruits of our labors and laid the first <br/>
living stone of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ]]<br/>
in England's great metropolis.</p>

<p>We walked into the city and called <br/>
upon Mr. Corner, who went forward<br/>
with us to the public baths and received<br/>
the initiatory ordinance of the Gospel.<br/>
He was baptized by Brother Kimball.</p>

<p>Returning to the house of Brother<br/>
Corner, Elders Kimball, [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] and my-<br/>
self [[laying on of hands|laid our hands]] upon his head and<br/>
confirmed him a member or the Church. <br/>
We returned to our homes that night, <br/>
thankful unto God for his goodness in<br/>
blessing our labors even thus much.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",09/02/1840
42659.0,41,1840-09-06,""">2nd of September</time> I was quite<br/>
ill. I had been unwell for several days, <br/>
but now I was obliged to keep to my <br/>
room; but Elders Kimball and Smith <br/>
went into the city to visit the people and <br/>
found some who hearkened to them favor-<br/>
ably. We had by this time found that <br/>
London was the hardest place for a mis-<br/>
sion that we had ever undertaken, but <br/>
we did not feel discouraged in the least, <br/>
and were determined in the name of the<br/>
Lord to set up the standard of the King-<br/>
dom in that city.</p>

<p>The following day I was still confined<br/>
to my room most of the time, but on<br/>
the next, Elders Kimball and Smith went <br/>
to [[Deptford, London, Middlesex, England|Debtford]], and I took a walk into the <br/>
city, called upon Brother Corner and <br/>
found him in good spirits. I also called</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
upon Mr. Panther, 17 Warf, City Road,<br/>
Basin, who was a director of a Methodist<br/>
chapel. I asked him for the chapel to <br/>
preach in. He said he had a school <br/>
house which would hold two hundred, <br/>
and that I might have that on Sunday. <br/>
So I gave out an appointment at Bowl <br/>
Court, 137 Shordeitch. I conversed <br/>
with several others who received my tes-<br/>
timony, and one woman said she would<br/>
be baptized.</p>

<p>Sunday, <time datetime=""",09/06/1840
42659.0,41,1840-09-09,""">September the 6th</time>, I preached <br/>
in the morning at Bowl Court, 137<br/>
Shoreditch, and was followed by Elders<br/>
Kimball and Smith. We also held a <br/>
meeting in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]], at 3 <br/>
o'clock in the afternoon, at which Elders<br/>
Kimball and Smith preached and I bore <br/>
my testimony to their words. One man <br/>
arose and opposed us, and was angry be-<br/>
cause of the truth of God. He continued <br/>
opposing, until the police stopped the <br/>
conversation.</p>

<p>We met again in the evening at Bowl <br/>
Court, to preach to the people, but <br/>
when we got there we found a plan con-<br/>
trived by several of the preachers for <br/>
one of them to preach, lest some should <br/>
believe our testimony. We went our <br/>
way and found four persons who re-<br/>
ceived our testimony and offered them-<br/>
selves for baptism.</p>

<p>Next day I wrote to Elder [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] of <br/>
my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] field of labor, and <br/>
walked to Brother Corner's and visited <br/>
several other friends. Two offered them-<br/>
selves for baptism. I visited [[St. Paul|St. Paul's]] <br/>
and then returned home. Elders Kim-<br/>
ball and Smith had just returned from a<br/>
visit to the Rev. [[Robert Aitken|Robert Aitken]]. He <br/>
received them kindly, acknowledged<br/>
their doctrine true, but was afraid of <br/>
deception. His mind was in a disturbed <br/>
state.</p>

<p>In the evening we held a meeting in<br/>
the Temperance Hall; but we had al-<br/>
most the bare walls to preach to, there <br/>
being only about thirty present. I <br/>
preached to the few present for about an<br/>
hour, and Elder Kimball followed me. <br/>
After paying seven shillings and six <br/>
pence for the use of the hall we returned <br/>
to our lodgings.</p>

<p>On <time datetime=""",09/09/1840
42659.0,41,,""">September the 9th</time> I paid my bills <br/>
and called upon the friends, in company <br/>
of Brothers Kimball and Smith, and on<br/>

brethren and friends in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] to re-<br/>
turn to [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]].</p>

<p>We had spent twenty-three days in <br/>
that great Babylon of modern times and <br/>
had found it harder to establish the <br/>
Church there than in any place where<br/>
we had ever been. We had baptized<br/>
one man, and ordained him a priest; <br/>
and six others had given in their names<br/>
to be baptized on the following Sunday; <br/>
and at this time there was some little <br/>
prospect of the Rev. [[Robert Aitken|Robert Aitken]] re-<br/>
ceiving the work. I, therefore, left <br/>
London feeling that our mission and<br/>
labors had not been altogether in vain.</p>

<p>I was rejoiced on my return to the <br/>
churches to find that the work was uni-<br/>
versally and rapidly progressing in Here-<br/>
fordshire. In some cases it was even <br/>
reaching the nobility, and a lady of <br/>
title had become convinced of the [[work of God|work <br/>
of God]] through our ministry.</p>

<p>[[Lady Roberts|Lady Roberts]] was of the nobility of <br/>
England and a lady of wealth, and had <br/>
withdrawn from the [[Church of England|Church of England]] <br/>
and had traveled much in search of truth<br/>
looking for the fulfillment of the Pro-<br/>
phets.</p>

<p>She became acquainted with the [[fulness of the gospel|ful-<br/>
ness of the Gospel]] through a female<br/>
servant in the employ of [[Squire Dowdswell|Squire Dowds-<br/>
well]]. She began to investigate the sub-<br/>
ject; the [[Spirit of God|Spirit of God]] rested upon her<br/>
and convinced her of the truth of the <br/>
work. She obtained the four numbers <br/>
published of the <i>[[Latter Day Saints|Millennial Star]]</i>, and, <br/>
fearing that she should not be able to <br/>
obtain them for herself, copied the <br/>
whole of them with her pen. She also <br/>
read the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] and copied a <br/>
part of that, and became perfectly con-<br/>
vinced of the truth of the work of <br/>
which she read, and said she would go a<br/>
thousand miles but what she would see <br/>
some of the Twelve and be baptized <br/>
under their hands. Hearing that I was <br/>
in London she was about to take a <br/>
journey there to see me, and the other<br/>
brethren, and be baptized. She had <br/>
two brothers, ministers of the Church of <br/>
England.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",09/21/1840
42659.0,42,1840-09-21,""">21st of September, 1840</time>, we <br/>
held the [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]] Conference, at <br/>
which were represented 24 churches, <br/>
with 754 members: 14 elders, 51 priests,<br/>
9 teachers and 1 deacon. The [[Brangreen, Newent, Gloucestershire, England|Bran <br/>
Green]] and Frome's Hill Conferences<br/>
were now composed of 40 churches,</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
1,007 members: 19 elders, 78 priests, <br/>
15 teachers and one deacon.</p>

<p>These two conferences, with their<br/>
forty branch churches, and over a thou-<br/>
sand organized members, under the di-<br/>
rection of one hundred and thirteen <br/>
ordained officers, had been raised up<br/>
within six months and a half. Surely<br/>
the [[work of God|work of God]]had been marvelous, <br/>
unparalleled perhaps in the history of<br/>
any new religious movement.</p>

<p>I meditated upon these things, and in <br/>
my journal of date <time datetime=""",09/21/1840
42659.0,42,,""">September 21st, <br/>
1840</time>, I wrote thus:</p>

<p>""This has been a busy day with me.<br/>
After standing upon my feet from morn-<br/>
ing till evening I am called to shake <br/>
hands with hundreds of Saints with glad<br/>
hearts and cheerful countenances. It is <br/>
with no ordinary feelings that I meditate <br/>
upon the cheering fact that a thousand <br/>
souls have been baptized into the [[new and everlasting covenant|new<br/>
and everlasting covenant]] in about half a <br/>
year in one field which God has enabled<br/>
me to open. I pray him to accept the<br/>
gratitude of my heart for his mercies <br/>
and blessings unto me in this thing, and<br/>
enable me to stand with these Saints<br/>
and all the righteous in His [[celestial kingdom|celestial <br/>
kingdom]].""</p>

<p>This day I had stood upon my feet <br/>
eight hours in conference, conversed <br/>
much of the time in suggesting, speak-<br/>
ing, motioning, etc.; ordained about<br/>
thirty, confirmed some, healed many <br/>
who were sick, shook hands with about<br/>
four hundred Saints, walked two miles,<br/>
and ended with about four hours chim-<br/>
ney corner preaching. I then laid down<br/>
to rest and dreamt of catching fish.</p>

<p>The church ministers at this time were <br/>
very much stirred up in this region be-<br/>
cause of the success of the work of God<br/>
in the midst of the people, and every <br/>
exertion was made by them to stay its<br/>
progress. They were finding that the <br/>
Lord was delivering their flocks out of<br/>
their hands and giving them unto the <br/>
shepherds of the Church of the Saints. <br/>
They were alarmed and were holding <br/>
conventions and meetings to contrive<br/>
plans and adopt means to overthrow the<br/>
latter-day work of God, which they un-<br/>
derstood not, and believed not, yet <br/>
feared its power. And well indeed they<br/>
might, for in some instances they did <br/>
not have more than ten or fifteen at their </p>",

churches on the Sabbath, while around<br/>
them on every hand they had seen forty<br/>

of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Latter-day Saints]] <br/>
spring up in about six months, with over<br/>
a thousand members and between one <br/>
and two hundred officers ordained to<br/>
scatter the seed of the Gospel every-<br/>
where in this prolific field.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",09/25/1840

to attend the conference at [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]], <br/>
which was held at [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]].</p>

tized one and preached at [[Tunstall, Staffordshire, England|Tunstell]], and <br/>
on the next evening at [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] to a <br/>
crowded audience, and the [[power of God|power of<br/>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",10/06/1840
42659.0,44,1840-10-14,""">6th of October, 1840</time>, a <br/>
general conference of the British mission <br/>
was held at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]. There were <br/>
present of the Twelve Apostles, [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[Willard Richards|Willard Rich-<br/>
ards]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and <br/>
Wilford Woodruff. The presiding officers <br/>
of the mission represented twenty-seven<br/>
conferences, besides other churches not<br/>
yet organized into conferences. The<br/>
number of membership was 3,621, being <br/>
an increase since the last general con-<br/>
ference of 1,113 members.</p>

<p>The next evening we attended a dis-<br/>
cussion held between a sectarian minister <br/>
and Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]] on the subject <br/>
of the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]]. There were <br/>
present 1,500 people. This was the first <br/>
discussion of any note on Mormonism<br/>
held in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].</p>

<p>I left Manchester on the <time datetime=""",10/14/1840
42659.0,44,,""">14th of October</time><br/>
to return to my labors in London; and <br/>
on my way, with Elder Alfred Cordon,<br/>
I visited the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]] and <br/>
[[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]. On the 17th I arrived in <br/>
London, where I found Elder George A.<br/>
Smith, and we were glad to meet each <br/>
other once again.</p>

<p>We hired lodgings, board and sitting <br/>
room at No. 40 Ironmonger Row, St. <br/>
Luke's. Everything was dear, and we <br/>
found with the greatest economy we <br/>
could not do with much less than a pound <br/>
per week each. What few Saints there <br/>
were in London were very poor and</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
unable to assist us. Most of the means <br/>
used in my labors in London was sup-<br/>
plied by my converts of Herefordshire.</p>

<p>The prospect in London at that time <br/>
was the darkest I had ever been in since<br/>
entering the vineyard, but the Lord was<br/>
with us and we were not discouraged.</p>

<p>Sunday we met with the Saints at <br/>
Brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] three times, read in the <br/>
[[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], gave instruction and<br/>
broke bread unto them. We had a good <br/>
time, though there was only about half <br/>
a dozen present. I felt the spirit bear<br/>
testimony that there would be a work<br/>
done in London.</p>

<p>I fell asleep, having retired to rest in <br/>
good season, and slept until midnight,<br/>
when I awoke and meditated upon the<br/>
things of God until 3 o'clock in the morn-<br/>
ing, and while forming a determination<br/>
to warn the people in London and over-<br/>
come the power of darkness by the assist-<br/>
ance of God, a person appeared unto me <br/>
whom I consider was the [[Prince of Darkness|prince of dark-<br/>
ness]]. He made war upon me and at-<br/>
tempted to take my life. He caught me by <br/>
the throat and nearly choked me to death.<br/>
He wounded me in my forehead and I <br/>
also wounded him in a number of places<br/>
in the head. As he was about to over-<br/>
come me I prayed to the Father in the <br/>
name of Jesus Christ for help. I then<br/>
had power over him and he left me,<br/>
though much wounded. Afterwards<br/>
three persons dressed in white came to <br/>
me and prayed with me and I was im-<br/>
mediately healed of all my wounds and<br/>
delivered of all my troubles.</p>

<p>During the following week we visited<br/>
the [[British Museum, London, Middlesex, England|British Museum]] and other notable<br/>
places, and also attended a Wesleyan <br/>
[[Methodist|Methodist]] mission meeting over which<br/>
the Lord Mayor presided; while in the </p>",

<p>The following Sunday we preached for<br/>
the first time in Barrett's Academy at<br/>
3 o'clock. There were present about <br/>
fifty persons, unto whom I preached and <br/>
Elder Smith preached in the evening; <br/>
but it was the hardest matter to awaken<br/>
an interest upon the subject that I had <br/>
ever found.</p>

<p>Next day I received a package of letters<br/>
from America, one from my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] an-<br/>
nouncing the death of my little daughter,<br/>
[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]].</p>

<p>There is so much going on in this great <br/>

quire the trumpet's blast from heaven to <br/>
awaken the attention of the inhabitants<br/>
to our proclamation of the restoration of <br/>
the [[fulness of the gospel|fullness of the Gospel]].</p>

<p>We were here like the Apostles of old<br/>
without purse or script to warn the City<br/>
of London, where we had to pay high<br/>
for everything we required, and to pay<br/>
for a place to preach in. We were at<br/>
this time about out of money, but still<br/>
we felt to trust in God.</p>

broke bread unto the Saints, and this<br/>

to the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] and spend his time with <br/>
the churches there. After his departure<br/>
I felt very lonely for several days, but<br/>
Elder [[William Hill Pitt|William Pitt]] from [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] came <br/>
and labored with me for a short time,<br/>
after which he took a mission to [[Ipswich, Suffolk, England|Ipswich]].</p>

<p>Brother Hulme, a captain of one of <br/>
the ""Pickford's Boats"" on the [[Regent|London <br/>
Canal]], was present at my next preaching<br/>
after the departure of Elder Pitt, and <br/>
with him were two of his hands whom<br/>
he had baptized. On the following day<br/>
I dined with him and the two brethren<br/>
on board their boat.</p>

<p>On the afternoon and evening of Sun-<br/>
day, the <time datetime=""",10/22/1840
42659.0,45,1840-12-03,""">22nd of October</time>, I held public<br/>
meeting at the Academy, when four <br/>
offered themselves for baptism; and on<br/>
the following Sunday I again preached<br/>
twice and baptized and confirmed three<br/>
more. These were the first fruits of my<br/>
labors in London.</p>

<p>Next day I took a very interesting<br/>
walk with Dr. [[William Copeland|Wm. Copeland]] through <br/>
every part of the College of Surgeons at<br/>
[[Lincoln|Lincoln's Inn Fields]], and on my return<br/>
home I was soon joined by Elders [[Brigham Young|Brig-<br/>
ham Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]], who had come <br/>
to spend a week or two in London. This <br/>
was the first time ever President Brigham<br/>
Young was in the metropolis of Eng-<br/>
land.</p>

<p>We met for service at the Academy <br/>
Wednesday evening, when Brother Brig-<br/>
ham preached, followed by Brother <br/>
Heber. We had a good time.</p>

<p>In company with Presidents Young <br/>
and Kimball on the <time datetime=""",12/03/1840
42659.0,45,,""">3rd of December</time> I <br/>
visited the [[Tower of London, London, Middlesex, England|Tower of London]], without <br/>
seeing which the traveler would lose a <br/>

visited [[St. Paul|St. Paul's]], [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]],<br/>
[[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]], the Queen's stables, <br/>
and saw many other noted sights of <br/>

<p>Sunday we held public meeting at the </p>",

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
[[Barrett|Academy]], at which there were about fifty<br/>
present. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] preached.</p>

<p>An Independent minister invited me<br/>
home to take tea with him. I accepted <br/>
his invitation, had an interesting time<br/>
and preached the Gospel to him and he<br/>
received my testimony and offered me his<br/>
chapel, which would hold 800. He said he<br/>
thought he would be baptized and would<br/>
try and get his society to do the same.</p>

<p>We met again in the evening and had <br/>
more at our meeting than ever before.<br/>
Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] preached and <br/>
was followed by Brothers Kimball, Wil-<br/>
liams, [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]], Hulme and myself.</p>

<p>We had a very interesting time and <br/>
one offered himself for baptism. There<br/>
were some of the [[Aitkenite|Aikenites]] present, one <br/>
of whom purchased a hymn book. They <br/>
wished us to call upon them and thought<br/>
they would be baptized. We then met <br/>
at Father Corner's and communed with<br/>
the Saints and had a good time.</p>

<p>I rejoiced at the prospect which was <br/>
opening before us, for we labored a long <br/>
time and the work had gone slow, but <br/>
now a wide opening was being made to <br/>
roll on the [[work of the Lord|work of the Lord]] in the me-<br/>
tropolis of England.</p>

<p>Having spent about ten days in Lon-<br/>
don President Young left for [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|Cheltenham]].<br/>
On the same day I visited Mr. [[James Albon|James <br/>
Albon]], a minister of the Independent<br/>
order, who with his household believed <br/>
our doctrine, and on the Sunday we found <br/>
more than ever an interest being awak-<br/>
ened in London, and our prayer meeting<br/>
the next evening was attended by the <br/>
Reverend James Albon, who received our <br/>
testimony. We walked home with him <br/>
and found his household growing in the <br/>
faith and ready for the work of the Lord.</p>

<p>Two days after in the evening we bap-<br/>
tized four, two of whom were [[Benjamin Morgan|Mr.]] and<br/>
Mrs [[Elizabeth George Morgan|Morgan]], with whom we lodged, <br/>
[[Christopher Smith|Christopher, Smith]] their apprentice, and<br/>
[[Henry Corner Jr.|Henry Corner, Jun.]]</p>

<p>The afternoon of the following day<br/>
Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland]] spent with us, and he re-<br/>
ceived our testimony, and in the evening <br/>
we preached at our meeting place.</p>

<p>I had visited the Rev. James Albon <br/>
several times and given him an account <br/>
of the rise and progress of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church <br/>
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. <br/>
He believed in our mission and offered <br/>
me his chapel to preach in, which would <br/>
seat about a thousand.</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
Sunday morning we accompanied our <br/>
reverend friend and convert to his chapel<br/>
and were introduced to the committee, <br/>
one of whom was a preacher who had<br/>
traveled much in [[Russia|Russia]] and other parts <br/>
of the world. At the close of the meet-<br/>
ing the Rev. James Albon gave out an <br/>
appointment for us to preach on the next <br/>
Sabbath evening.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we met with the<br/>
Saints, confirmed four and had a full <br/>
house, and in the evening we preached<br/>
again and a good feeling prevailed.</p>

<p>After meeting the Rev. James Albon <br/>
called upon us at our room and told us <br/>
that he had given out our appointment<br/>
to preach in his chapel and had informed<br/>
his congregation that he was a Latter-day <br/>
Saint, and should be baptized and join <br/>
our Church, and that they need not<br/>
longer consider him a member of their <br/>
body unless they with him joined the<br/>
Saints. He told us this made a division <br/>
among the committee; some were for <br/>
going with him and some against follow-<br/>
ing their pastor into the true fold which <br/>
he had found.</p>

<p>The Sunday following in the evening <br/>
we preached, by the appointment of its<br/>
minister, in the Independent chapel to<br/>
the largest congregation we had ever dis-<br/>
coursed before in London. There were  <br/>
present priests and people of many de-<br/>
nominations. I addressed them for<br/>
about the space of one hour. A Wes-<br/>
leyan minister arose and opposed me,<br/>
which had a good effect, for the congre-<br/>
gation seeing the spirit he was of turned <br/>
against him, and the committee refused <br/>
him the permission to speak there any <br/>
more. I was much bound by the oppos-<br/>
ing spirit, still the conduct of the enemy <br/>
gave us friends.</p>

<p>The next evening we attended what <br/>
was said to have been the largest temper-<br/>
ance meeting ever held in London, and <br/>
the next two days brought us to the<br/>
close of the year.</p>

[[Oxford, Oxfordshire, England|Oxford]], [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. Traveled 4,469 miles; <br/>
held 230 meetings, and established 53<br/>
places for preaching; I planted 47 <br/>
churches and jointly organized them.<br/>
These churches were chiefly comprised<br/>
in the two conferences raised up in [[Herefordshire, England|Here-<br/>
fordshire]], consisting of about 1,500 <br/>
Saints, 28 elders, no priests, 24 teachers, <br/>
and 10 deacons.</p>

<p>The baptisms of the year were three <br/>
hundred and thirty-six persons under my <br/>
own hands, and I assisted in the baptism<br/>
of eighty-six others. I baptized 57 <br/>
preachers, mostly of the connection of <br/>
the [[United Brethren|United Brethren]], and also 2 clerks of<br/>
the Church of England. I confirmed <br/>
420, and assisted in confirming 50 others.<br/>
I ordained 18 elders, 97 priests, 34 <br/>
teachers and 1 deacon. I blessed 120 <br/>
children, and administered to 120 sick <br/>
by prayer, anointing and the [[laying on of hands|laying on <br/>

sick were healed, and devils cast out. I <br/>
assisted in procuring £1,000 for the pub-<br/>
lication of 3,000 copies of the hymn <br/>
book, 5,000 copies of the Book of Mor-<br/>
mon, and for the printing of the <i>Mil-<br/>
lennial Star</i>, and to assist two hundred<br/>
Saints to emigrate to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. I wrote <br/>
200 letters and received 112.</p>

<p>The new year, 1841, found Elder <br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself in the metropolis of <br/>
England in the enjoyment of good <br/>
health. We celebrated New Year's day<br/>
by baptizing two into the fold of Christ. <br/>
The church in London now numbered<br/>
twenty-one members.</p>

<p>The next Sunday we held a meeting in<br/>
the [[Barrett|Academy]], confirmed two, and par-<br/>
took of the sacrament.</p>

<p>During the week I baptized the <br/>
daughter of the Rev. [[James Albon|James Albon]], and <br/>
the day after Elder Kimball started to <br/>
[[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] to break up new ground. On<br/>
the Sunday he preached there for the <br/>
first time, when four persons offered <br/>
themselves for baptism. Next day they<br/>
came to London, and we immediately <br/>
repaired to our private bath in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Taber-<br/>
nacle Square]], and Elder Kimball bap-<br/>
tized five persons, one of whom was Dr. <br/>
[[William Copeland|Wm. Copeland]].</p>

<p>This was indeed an interesting occa-<br/>
sion and we felt thankful to God to see<br/>
the cloud beginning to break, for we had <br/>
struggled hard to do the little which had <br/>
been done.</p>

three more of Brother [[Benjamin Morgan|Morgan]]'s house-<br/>
hold, and on the following Sunday I <br/>
preached to a full house and to many<br/>
new hearers. Several offered themselves <br/>
for baptism, and there had been during <br/>
the week added unto the Church seven <br/>
souls.</p>

<p>Next day Elder Kimball received a <br/>
letter from Elder [[Brigham Young|Young]], who wished us<br/>
to be ready to set sail for home early in <br/>
April.</p>

<p>Several days later I baptized the Rev. <br/>
James Albon and Mr. [[William Hender|Hender]], and be-<br/>
fore the close of January I baptized three<br/>
others into the Church.</p>

<p>I visited [[Greenwich, Kent, England|Greenwich]] and Woolwich, <br/>
where Elder Kimball had raised up a <br/>
small branch of the Church. I returned<br/>
to London with Elder Kimball. On the <br/>
Sunday we communed with the Saints,<br/>
and in the evening we both preached to<br/>
a full congregation.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",02/08/1841

Heber C. Kimball and myself went to <br/>

right of the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] in the <br/>
name of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith, Jr.]] We left five <br/>
copies of the book, and paid three shil-<br/>

<p>In the evening we baptized four per-<br/>
sons, one of whom was the [[Mary Ann Eacock Albon|wife]] of Rev. <br/>
James Albon, who had already received <br/>
the Gospel.</p>

<p>Elder Brigham Young, per letter, in-<br/>
formed us of the large emigration of<br/>
that season. There were to go on one <br/>
ship 235, and on another 100.</p>

<p>To the reader acquainted with the im-<br/>

<p>The president then called for the <br/>
representation of the branches of the<br/>

<p>The Church at [[Bedford, Bedfordshire, England|Bedford]] was represented <br/>

DR. WM. COPELAND, <i>Clerk.</i></p>

<p>During this Conference meeting we <br/>
also broke bread with the Saints and con-<br/>
firmed four. At half-past 6 in the evening, <br/>
we met again and had the largest con-<br/>
gregation which had assembled at our <br/>
preaching place. One came forward for<br/>
baptism.</p>

<p>This was a day which we had long de-<br/>
sired to see, for we had labored exceed<br/>
ingly hard to establish a Church in Lon-<br/>
don and at times it seemed as though we<br/>
should have to give it up, but by holding <br/>
on to the work of our Divine Master and <br/>
claiming the promises of God, we were <br/>
now to leave an established London Con-<br/>
ference with a prosperous Church planted<br/>
in the metropolis, under the care of our <br/>
beloved Brother Lorenzo Snow.</p>

<p>Brother Kimball, on the <time datetime=""",02/15/1841
42659.0,48,1841-02-25,""">15th</time>, received<br/>
a letter from his [[Vilate Murray Kimball|wife]], informing us that<br/>
the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] had written for the <br/>
Twelve to come immediately home.</p>

<p>At this time there was a prospect of <br/>
war between America and England, over <br/>
the imprisonment of [[Alexander McLeod|McCloud]], a British<br/>
officer, by the State of [[New York|New York]], and <br/>
the northeastern boundary question. <br/>

Prophet Joseph wrote for the Twelve to <br/>
come home, after first thoroughly organ-<br/>
izing the British mission and calling out <br/>
a number of native elders to send in<br/>
every direction throughout [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].</p>

time in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] before my return to<br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. Next day I parted from [[Lorenzo Snow|Lor-<br/>
enzo Snow]] and the London Saints and <br/>
took train for [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]], to visit the branch <br/>
which had been raised up there by my<br/>
convert Elder [[Thomas Kington|Thomas Kington]], who it <br/>
will be remembered was the superin-<br/>
tendent of the [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]] Circuit of<br/>
[[United Brethren|United Brethren]].</p>

<p>Leaving Bristol I visited the churches<br/>
which I had raised up, for the purpose of <br/>
holding conferences and bidding farewell<br/>
to the Saints, hundreds of whom I had <br/>
myself baptized.</p>

<p>When I arrived at [[Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales|Monmouth]], Elder <br/>
[[James George Morgan|James Morgan]] was waiting my coming, <br/>
and had given out an appointment for<br/>
me to preach in the town at 7 o'clock, at<br/>
the house of [[Robert Houston Davis|Robert Davis]]. There was a <br/>
crowded meeting and many could not get<br/>
into the house. Four offered themselves<br/>
for baptism. The Spirit witnessed to me<br/>
that there would many embrace the Gos-<br/>
pel in Monmouthshire, and I said, ""the<br/>
harvest is great and the laborers few.""</p>

<p>I arose in the morning refreshed by<br/>
sleep, and having taken breakfast with <br/>
Mr. [[Mr. Maston|Matton]], I walked ten miles through<br/>
mud and water in a driving March rain<br/>
storm to sister [[Mary Morgan|Mary Morgan]] at [[Little Garway, Herefordshire, England|Little<br/>
Garway]], where I found a pleasant family <br/>
of the Saints. We were drenched with <br/>
rain but found a good fire and spent the<br/>
day comfortably and in the evening I had<br/>
an interesting interview with Elder [[Martin Littlewood|Little-<br/>
wood]]; the next day at Sister Morgan's, <br/>
reading the history of [[Rome, Lazio, Italy|Rome]], with much<br/>
interest, and in the evening I met the <br/>
officers of the Church there in council and <br/>
had a good time. Sunday I preached in<br/>
the morning at the house of Brother<br/>
[[Thomas Rook|Thomas Rood]], and in the evening at the<br/>
Kitchen upon the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], and <br/>
had the place full.</p>

<p><i>The Garway Conference, held <time datetime=""",03/08/1841
42659.0,49,,""">March <br/>
8th, 1841</time></i>—I met the Garway conference<br/>
at the Kitchen. Elder [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] was<br/>
chosen president and Elder James Mor-<br/>
gan, clerk. There were present one of <br/>
the Quorum of the Twelve, one High <br/>
Priest, seven Elders, eleven Priests, two<br/>
Teachers and one Deacon. The meeting <br/>
opened with prayer by Elder Woodruff, <br/>
after which the churches were represented<br/>
as follows: Members, 134; Elders, 4;<br/>
Priests, 5; Teachers, 3; Deacons, 1.</p>

<p>After the representation it was moved <br/>
that [[John Needham|John Needham]] be ordained [[Elder|elder]],</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
[[William Morris, bap. pre 1840|William Morris]] priest and [[Thomas Rough|Thomas Rough]]<br/>
teacher. These were ordained under the <br/>
hands of Elders Woodruff and Richards.<br/>
The meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock and<br/>
one person was baptized.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Elder Levi Richards <br/>
spoke and I followed him. After meet-<br/>
ing the Saints contributed one pound to <br/>
help me, and sold them three books of <br/>
Mormon and fifty addresses to the citi-<br/>
zens of London. I then walked five <br/>
miles with Brother Richards to Brother <br/>
[[John Holley|Holley's]] and spent the night. This was <br/>
the first time I had seen Brother Levi for <br/>
about two years.</p>

<p>Next day in company of Elders Levi<br/>
Richards and [[Thomas Pitt|Thomas Pitt]] I walked to <br/>
the city of [[Hereford, Herefordshire, England|Hereford]], where Elder [[William Kay|Ray]] <br/>
and others had been preaching.</p>

<p>On Sunday a preacher arose before two <br/>
or three thousand people in the market<br/>
house and informed the multitude that<br/>
he had a fresh letter direct from America, <br/>
showing the origin of the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mor-<br/>
mon]]. So he read the old Spaulding<br/>
story. When he got through Elder Levi <br/>
Richards arose and informed the people<br/>
that instead of its being a new story it<br/>
had been published for seven years <br/>
throughout the United States and in<br/>
England. This caused a great uproar, for <br/>
while some were for driving the man out<br/>
of the place for lying, others were crowding<br/>
around Elders Richards and Ray to hear <br/>
them preach. The crowd, however, was so <br/>
excited that they left the ground with <br/>
hundreds following them. There never <br/>
was a time when the people were so much<br/>
stirred up and eager to hear the[[Latter-day Saints| Latter-<br/>
day Saints]] as at the present, and it was<br/>
expected that we should not get through<br/>
the city without having crowds around<br/>
us. We did, however, and had a view of <br/>
Hereford Cathedral as we passed along <br/>
and reached Sister Bufton's.</p>

<p>There was at this time a small branch<br/>
of the Church at Hereford, numbering<br/>
seven members. We parted from Brother<br/>
Pitt at Hereford, and continued to [[Lugwardine, Herefordshire, England|Lug-<br/>
wardine]], where I met with the Church for<br/>
the last time and preached from the ##Isaiah 24|24th## <br/>
of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].</p>

<p>On the morrow I walked to [[Shucknall Hill, Herefordshire, England|Shucknell <br/>
Hill]] and had an interesting meeting with<br/>
the Saints and preached upon the gather-<br/>

Hill and dined with Brother [[Edward Ockey|Ockey]], whom<br/>
I was truly glad to see once more. We <br/>
went together through [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley Hill]] and<br/>
called upon the Saints. Six months had<br/>
passed since I had parted from the <br/>
churches in this region, but now I was <br/>
again in the field where the Lord by His <br/>
blessing and the power of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy<br/>
Ghost]] had made my labors so abundantly<br/>
fruitful.</p>

<p>Next day I went to [[Greenway, Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Greenway]] and <br/>
preached, blessed a child, confirmed a<br/>
member and administered the ordinance<br/>
of the Gospel to five sick persons; and<br/>
on the morrow continued to [[Turkey Hall, Eldersfield, Worcestershire, England|Turkey Hill]]. <br/>
Here on the Sunday I communed with <br/>
the saints and preached to a large con-<br/>
gregation upon the gathering. I found<br/>
the Saints in the region around very de-<br/>
sirous to gather to the body of the <br/>
Church, but they were poor and had not<br/>
the means.</p>

<p>WILFORD WOODRUFF, <i>President</i>. <br/>
[[John Hill|JOHN HILL]], <i>Clerk</i>.</p>

<p>We had a very interesting time at the <br/>
conference and a large assembly of the <br/>
Saints. It was the last time that I should <br/>
attend in that part of my old and beloved <br/>
field of labor, during my present mission<br/>
to England, and whether or not I should <br/>
ever meet here in a conference assembly <br/>
of Saints again was one of the secrets of <br/>
my future life for time to reveal. We <br/>
had held our meeting without disturbance<br/>
from the mob who were present, for<br/>
they were kept quiet by the police in at-<br/>
tendance who were in disguise.</p>

<p>No sooner had the meeting closed than<br/>
multitudes of the Saints crowded around<br/>
me and hands were presented me on <br/>
every side, to bid me farewell. Many<br/>
called for me to bless them before I de-<br/>
parted. Others cried out, ""Lay hands<br/>
upon me and heal me before you go.""</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
One came with, ""Brother Woodruff, I am <br/>
turned out of doors for my religion; <br/>
what shall I do?'' Another with, ""I am <br/>
ready to go to Zion, but my wife won't go <br/>
with me; shall I leave her to gather with<br/>
the Saints?"" A wife in turn says, ""My <br/>
husband beat me and turned me out of <br/>
doors because I have been baptized. I <br/>
have money enough to carry me and the<br/>
children to Zion; will you let me go with-<br/>
out him?"" ""Brother Woodruff, my <br/>
mother is over 80 years of age and has <br/>
willed me 60 pounds at her death, but <br/>
will not emigrate with me; must I stay <br/>
for her to die or leave her now to go with <br/>
the Saints?"" One said, ""I have sold <br/>
my little place and shall have 30 pounds <br/>
to-morrow, but must go out into the<br/>
street. I have not enough to carry my<br/>
family to America; can you help me to a <br/>
few pounds or tell me what to do?"" And<br/>
an Elder cried out, ""How much longer <br/>
must I preach in England before you will<br/>
let me go to America?"" ""Brother Wood-<br/>
ruff, would you come and preach in [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|Chel-<br/>
tenham]]?"" ""My head is in great pain, <br/>
would you heal me? "" ""I want you to <br/>
consecrate this bottle of oil before you<br/>
go?"" ""Will you write to me?"" ""I <br/>
have been waiting a long time to get a <br/>
chance to speak to you; good by, remem-<br/>
ber me to Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]], good by! God <br/>
bless you!''</p>

<p>Thus was I for more than an hour after <br/>
the close of the meeting assailed with <br/>
the affectionate outbursts and adieus and <br/>
a host of perplexities of these Saints who<br/>
crowded around me as children to their<br/>
father.</p>

<p>Many of the Saints parted from me<br/>
in tears and many followed me to <br/>
Turkey Hill where I spent the night and <br/>
they filled the house until a late hour, <br/>
begging counsel and instruction of me.<br/>
One of these was a [[Baptist|Baptist]] minister who <br/>
had just been baptized into the Church.</p>

<p>On the morrow, in company with El-<br/>
der [[John Needham|Needham]], I walked to [[Keysend Street, Berrow, Worcestershire, England|Keysend <br/>
Street]], where I preached to a crowded <br/>
congregation of Saints. On the follow-<br/>
ing day I walked to [[Wind Point, Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Wind Point]], where<br/>
I visited the Saints, and thence con-<br/>
tinued to [[Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Colwall]]. Here I met with a<br/>
large congregation of Saints and <br/>
preached to them upon the gathering.</p>

<p>Next day, with Elder [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]], I <br/>
walked over [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]] and called <br/>
upon Elder [[Samuel Jones, b. 1823|Samuel Jones]]; thence</p>",

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
through [[Great Malvern, Worcestershire, England|Great Malvern]] to [[Crowcutt, Worcestershire, England|Crowcat]]; I <br/>
held a meeting at Brother [[George Brooks|George Brooks']]<br/>
and had an interesting time with a large <br/>
number of Saints whom I had baptized <br/>
about a year before. I went to [[Dunns Close, Herefordshire, England|Dunclose]] <br/>
the day after, visiting many of the Saints<br/>
by the way, [[laying on of hands|laying hands]] upon the sick, <br/>
and blessing and counseling others of the<br/>
flock. They all were happy to see me, <br/>
for I had baptized most of them when I <br/>
first opened that field of labor. Next <br/>
day we traveled to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]], and <br/>
visited the Saints by the way.</p>

<p>At Frome's Hill I met with the Saints <br/>
on Sunday morning, and had a crowded <br/>
house; in the afternoon we held a meet-<br/>
ing at [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley Hill]], where I communed <br/>
with the church. At the close of the<br/>
meeting I had a busy time shaking hands <br/>
with the Saints and parting from them. <br/>
Many of them wished me to bless them,<br/>
and others to heal them. I spent the<br/>
night with Brother [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] at <br/>
Elder [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey's]], and on the mor-<br/>
row we held the Frome's Hill conference<br/>
at Standley Hill.</p>

<p>There were present of the traveling <br/>
high council, 2 high priests, 20 elders, <br/>
30 priests, 9 teachers, and 2 deacons.</p>

<p>After calling the meeting to order, I <br/>
moved that Elder Levi Richards should <br/>
preside over the conference, and he was<br/>
sustained by the meeting. I was chosen <br/>
clerk.</p>

<p>After singing and prayer, the presi-<br/>
dent called upon the officers for the rep-<br/>
resentation of the various branches, <br/>
which was given as follows: branches, <br/>
33; members, 957; elders, 24; priests, <br/>
68; teachers, 27; deacons, 8.</p>

<p>[[Robert Gomery|Robert Gummery]], [[Edward Phillips|Edward Philips]] and <br/>
[[John Spiers|John Spires]] were ordained to the office<br/>
of elder, under the hands of Elders <br/>
Richards, [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] and myself; [[Thomas Bishop|Thomas<br/>
Bishop]] to the office of priest, and [[William Rowley|Wm. <br/>
Rowley]] to the office of deacon.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, after speeches from<br/>
Elders Richards and Kington, I delivered <br/>
my farewell address and pronounced the<br/>
benediction on the conference.</p>

<p>After the meeting was dismissed, I was<br/>
almost three hours shaking hands with<br/>
the Saints, healing the sick and giving <br/>
counsel to the multitude who surrounded <br/>
me, many of whom were in tears when <br/>
we parted. Nearly fifty came to me to ask<br/>
me to take them to Zion, when I had not<br/>
means to take myself. I, however, gave</p>

<p>[Column 2]<br/>
Sister [[Mary Jenkins Foxall|Foxal]] five pounds to help her and <br/>
her husband and children to the land of <br/>
America. She had made every exertion <br/>
for six months to save money to gather <br/>
with the Saints, and had raised thirty <br/>
pounds. The five pounds I gave to her<br/>
was a donation from Elder Edward <br/>
Ockey, who was imparting of his sub-<br/>
stance to help the poor of the church to<br/>
gather.</p>

<p>After bidding the multitude of Saints<br/>
farewell, I went to Elder Ockey's, to <br/>
spend the night, accompanied by Elders<br/>
Richards, Kington and [[William Kay|Ray]].</p>

<p>We had been in the house but a short <br/>
time when three of Edward Ockey's <br/>
brothers came in for the purpose of hav-<br/>
a contest, because their brother and sis-<br/>
ter had embraced the gospel and was<br/>
about to gather with the Saints. They <br/>
manifested much wrath against me, and, <br/>
after conversing with them about three <br/>
hours, they left the house, and we were<br/>
once more in peace.</p>

<p>After conversing together until the<br/>
third watch of the night, we retired to <br/>
rest, closing one of the busiest days of<br/>
my life.</p>

<p>I arose in the morning, refreshed by <br/>
sleep, and, after conversing several hours <br/>
with Elders Richards, Kington, Kay, <br/>
Ockey and others, I was under the ne-<br/>
cessity of parting with the Saints in this <br/>
region.</p>

<p>In bidding them farewell I found in <br/>
our hearts and memory of our associa-<br/>
tion many ties which bound me to those<br/>
I were leaving behind and among the<br/>
faithful ones were the Ockeys.</p>

<p>Brother Edward Ockey and his sister <br/>
[[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann]] were of a good and wealthy family. <br/>
They had many trials to pass through to <br/>
do the [[will of God|will of God]] and to gather with <br/>
the Saints, for their brothers were exceed-<br/>
ingly set against them. But Brother <br/>
Edward had maintained his integrity like<br/>
a man of God and was making every<br/>
preparation to gather with the Saints, but<br/>
his sister Ann had fears that her brothers <br/>
would hinder her gathering.</p>

<p>Having bid farewell to the Saints of <br/>
Standley Hill, I walked to Frome's Hill<br/>
and conversed with the elders until two <br/>
o'clock, when I took the parting hands <br/>
of Elders Richards, Kington, Ray and<br/>
others, and with my carpet bag with about <br/>
20 pounds weight in it, walked fifteen <br/>
miles to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] in four hours.</p>",

<p>[Column 1]<br/>
When I arrived there I was so very<br/>
lame and weary with my heavy load and<br/>
fast walking that I could scarcely walk<br/>
at all. I then took rail and arrived in<br/>
[[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] at 10 o'clock at night, but<br/>
was exceedingly lame and weary. I <br/>
spent the night with Elder [[James Riley|James Riley]], <br/>
24 Park Street.</p>

<p>I had now fairly ended my [[Herefordshire, England|Hereford-<br/>
shire]] mission, and bidden a last farewell <br/>
to that field of labor where the Lord had<br/>
blessed me beyond all my expectations.</p>

<p>I now left three conferences in the re-<br/>
gion which I opened one year before, on<br/>
the <time datetime=""",03/05/1841

vineyard, planted all over with churches, <br/>
numbering fifteen hundred Saints.</p>

will show at a glance the rise and pro-<br/>
gress of the churches in Herefordshire, <br/>

were present of the Twelve, [[George Albert Smith|George A. <br/>

high priest, 13 elders, 28 priests, 10 <br/>
teachers, and 8 deacons. The confer-<br/>
ence was held in the Magistrate's Assem-<br/>
bly Room.</p>

<p>At the close of the conference it was<br/>
voted that ""this conference grant unto <br/>
Elders Woodruff and George A. Smith a <br/>
letter of recommendation manifesting<br/>
that the Church in this region accept of <br/>
their labors and consider that they have<br/>
filled their mission with honor and dig-<br/>
nity.""</p>

<p>We had a very interesting time on this <br/>
occasion. The conference was held in a<br/>
place which would hold 800 and it was <br/>
crowded; but there was perfect order <br/>
and much good feeling manifested dur-<br/>
ing the day. There was prospect of a<br/>
continued increase in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]].</p>

<p>George A. Smith was the president of <br/>
the conference and [[Thomas Joseph Filcher|T. J. Fitcher]] and [[Osmond Shaw|O.<br/>
Shaw]], clerks.</p>

<p>Next day George A. Smith and my-<br/>
self met the officers in council at the<br/>
[[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]] Meeting Rooms and gave such<br/>
advise as we deemed wisdom, and then <br/>
took our farewell.</p>

<p>On the following day we also parted <br/>
from the Saints at [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]], took coach<br/>
to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]], and called upon [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley<br/>

blessed and [[set apart|set apart]] Orson Hyde for his <br/>

wish to know how to have your bread fall butter side up<br/>
then butter it both sides and it will fall so. Uppose<br/>
this work and it will roll over you. When did this<br/>
work ever stop since it began? Never. The only<br/>
thing the Saints now want to know is what does <br/>
the Lord want of us and we are ready to do it. Well<br/>
then build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] of the Lord; keep the law of<br/>
God ye Saints and the hypocrit and scoundral will <br/>
flee out of your midst and tremble for the fire of God<br/>
will be ^too^ hot for them"".</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Prophet &amp; the Presidential Chair</p>

<p>Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] followed Brigham Young in an address<br/>
upon government and political matters and Joseph in an<br/>
address after said</p>

<p>""As to politics I care but little about<br/>
the Presidential Chair. I would not give half as much for<br/>
the office as I would for the one I now hold; but as the<br/>
world have used the power of government to oppress and<br/>
persecute us it is right for us to use it for the protection<br/>
of our rights. When I get hold of the eastern papers<br/>
^and^ I see how popular I am, I am affraid myself that I shall<br/>
be elected; but if I should be ^ellected^ I would not say your<br/>
cause is just but I cannot do anything for you</p>",
42658.0,23,1844-03-08,"<p>What [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] said in relation to the<br/>
<u>Anexation</u> <u>of</u> <u>[[Republic of Texas|Texas]]</u></p>

<p>is with some unpopular. The people are opposed to it.<br/>
I will take this objection away. The opposition is because <br/>
it is filled up with slavery. Now I wish to turn the<br/>
argument. It is the very reason why they ought to be<br/>
received in order to watch over them. Of the two evils<br/>
we should reject the greatest. The President of Texas<br/>
says if you do not receive us in the United States we<br/>
will go to the British. This would certainly be bad<br/>
policy for this nation. The British are now throughout<br/>
the whole country trying to bribe all they can. How<br/>
much better it is to be to a little expence than to have<br/>
the Indians and British upon us. We should grasp<br/>
all the Territory we can. I know much which I<br/>
do not tell. I have had bribes offered to me but I <br/>
have rejected them. The government will not receive<br/>
anything from me. They are self-sufficient; but they<br/>
must go to Hell and work out their own salvation<br/>
with fear and trembling. As soon as Texas<br/>
^was^ is anexed I would liberate two are three States<br/>
and <strike>Gi</strike>pay them for their slaves and let them go<br/>
to Mexico where they are mixed [[Blacks|blacks]] &amp;c. I would<br/>
also receive [[Canada, British North America|Canadia]] and stand by it.""</p>

<p>Next day <time datetime=""",03/08/1844
42658.0,23,,""">March the 8th</time> I met in<br/>
council with the Twelve and First Presidency when the<br/>
subject of nominating a candidate for the vice Presidency <br/>
of the U.S. came up. They had nominated<br/>
General [[James Arlington Bennet|Arlington Bennet]] not knowing that he was<br/>
a native of Ireland. The final decision was for<br/>
me to write to Col. [[Solomon Copeland|Solomon Copeland]] ^of Tennessee^ to invite him<br/>
to visit us and see if he would suffer his name</p>",

<p>A large Assembly of the Saints [m]et at<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and was addressed by [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] upon</p>

<p><u>The Work Calling &amp; Spirit of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]] [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] &amp; Messiah</u></p>

<p>There is a difference between the spirit and<br/>
office of Elias and Elijah. It is the Spirit of Elias I <br/>
wish first to speak off. And in order to come to <br/>
the subject I will bring some of the testimony from<br/>
the Scripture and give also my own.</p>

<p>In the first place suffice it to say<br/>
that I went into the woods to inquire of the Lord by prayer<br/>
His will concerning me and I saw an angel and he<br/>
laid his hands upon my head and ordained me to be a<br/>
Priest after the order of [[Aaron (OT)|Aaron]] and to hold the keys of this<br/>
Priesthood which office was to preach repentance and baptism<br/>
for the remission of sins and also to baptize. But<br/>
I was informed that this office did not extend to the<br/>
laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and that<br/>
that office was a greater work and was to be given afterward<br/>
but that my ordination at that time was a preparatory<br/>
work or a going before which was the spirit of Elias for <br/>
the spirit of Elias was a going before to prepare the way<br/>
for the greater.</p>

<p>This was the case with [[John the Baptist (NT)|John the Baptist]].<br/>
He came crying from the wilderness ""Prepare ye the the<br/>
way of the Lord and make his paths straight and the people</p>",
42658.0,25,,"<p>were informed that if they would receive it it was the Spirit of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]].<br/>
[[John the Baptist (NT)|John]] was very particular to tell the people he was not that light<br/>
but was sent to bear witness thereof. He told them that his<br/>
mission was to preach repentance and baptism with water<br/>
but that it was he who should come after him who should<br/>
baptize with fire and the Holy Ghost. If he had been <br/>
an imposter he might have worked beyond his bounds <br/>
and undertook to have performed ordinances which did not<br/>
belong to the office and calling under the spirit of Elias.</p>

<p>The spirit of Elias is to prepare the <br/>
way for a greater revelation of God. This is the Priesthood <br/>
of Elias or the Priesthood unto which [[Aaron (OT)|Aaron]] was ordained.<br/>
And when God sends a man into the world to Prepare<br/>
for a greater work he holds the Keys of the power of<br/>
Elias. It was called the doctrine of Elias even<br/>
from the early ages of the world.</p>

<p>John's mission was limited to preaching<br/>
and baptizing but what he did was legal and when<br/>
Jesus Christ came to any of John's disciples he baptized<br/>
them with fire and the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>We find the Apostles endowed<br/>
with greater power than John. Their office was more<br/>
under the Spirit and power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] than of Elias.<br/>
In the case of [[Philip (NT)|Philip]] when he went down to [[Samaria, Palestine|Samaria]]<br/>
under the Spirit of Elias he baptized both men and <br/>
women but when [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] and [[John (NT)|John]] heard of it they went<br/>
down and laid their hands on them and they received<br/>
the Holy Ghost. This shows the distinction between<br/>
the two powers. When [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] came to certain disciples<br/>
he asked if they had received the Holy Ghost. They<br/>
answered, ""No."" ""Who baptized you then?""<br/>
""We were baptized unto John's baptism."" ""No John<br/>
did not baptize your for he did his work right.""</p>",
42658.0,26,,"<p>So [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] baptized them over again for he knew what the true<br/>
doctrine was and he knew that [[John the Baptist (NT)|John]] had not baptized them<br/>
and it is strange to me that men who have read the Scrip[tures]<br/>
of the New Testament are so far from these principles.</p>

<p>What [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] want to impress upon your<br/>
mind is the difference of power in different parts of the<br/>
Priesthood so that when any man comes among you saying<br/>
I have the Spirit of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]] you may know whether he be<br/>
true or false for any man coming having the spirit <br/>
and power of Elias will not transcend his bounds. John<br/>
did not transcend his bounds but faithfully performed<br/>
that part belonging to his office. And every portion of<br/>
the great building should be prepared rightly and assigned <br/>
to its proper place.</p>

<p>It is necessary to know who holds<br/>
the Keys of power and who do not or we may be likely<br/>
to be deceived. That person who holds the keys of <br/>
Elias has a preparatory work. But if I spend <br/>
much more time in conversing about the spirit of<br/>
Elias I shall not have time to do justice to the spirit<br/>
and power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] who is the Elias spoken of in the<br/>
last days. And here is the rock upon which many<br/>
split thinking the time was past in the days of<br/>
Jesus Christ and no more to be; but the spirit of <br/>
Elias was revealed to me and I know it is true therefor[e]<br/>
I speak with boldness for I know verily my doctrine<br/>
is true.</p>

<p>Now for Elijah. The spirit power <br/>
and calling of Elijah is that we have power to hold <br/>
the keys of the revelations ordinances oracles and endowm[ents]<br/>
of the fulness of the Melchezedec Priesthood and of<br/>
the Kingdom of God on the earth and to receive and<br/>
perform all the ordinances of the Kingdom of God</p>",
42658.0,27,,"<p>even to the sealing of the hearts of the fathers unto the children and<br/>
the hearts of the children unto the fathers even those who are <br/>
in heaven.</p>

<p>[[Malachi (OT)|Malachi]] says, ""I will send [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]]<br/>
before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come and He<br/>
shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children and the hearts<br/>
of the children to the Fathers lest I come and smite the earth<br/>
with a curse.</p>

<p>Now what [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] am after is the knowledge<br/>
of God and I take my own course to obtain it. What<br/>
are we to understand by this ^the mission of Elijah^ in the last days. In the<br/>
days of [[Noah (OT)|Noah]] God destroyed the world by a flood and<br/>
he has promised to destroy it by fire in the last<br/>
days. But before it takes place Elijah shall first <br/>
come and turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children &amp;c<br/>
Now comes the point. What is the office and work <br/>
of Elijah? and this is one of the most important subjects<br/>
that God has revealed.</p>

<p>He shall send Elijah to seal the<br/>
fathers to the children and the children to the fathers!<br/>
Now was this merely confined to the living to settle<br/>
difficulties with families on earth? By no means.<br/>
It was a far greater work. Elijah, What would <br/>
you do were you here? Would you confine your <br/>
work to the living alone. No. I would refer you<br/>
to the Scripture where the subject is manifest.<br/>
""Without us they cannot be made perfect nor we without <br/>
them."" the fathers without the children nor the children without the fathers.</p>

<p>I wish you to understand this subject <br/>
for it is important and if you will receive it this is the<br/>
spirit of Elijah that we redeem our dead and connect<br/>
ourselves with our fathers who are in heaven and seal<br/>
up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection</p>",
42658.0,28,,"<p>And here we want the power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] to seal those who<br/>
dwell on the earth to those who dwell in heaven. This is<br/>
the power of Elijah and the keys of the Kingdom of Jehovah.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a case. Suppose the<br/>
great God who dwells in the heavens should reveal himself<br/>
to Father [[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]] here and tell him I offer up a decree<br/>
that whatsoever you seal on earth with your decree will I<br/>
seal in heaven. You have power then? Can it be<br/>
taken off? No. Then what you seal on earth by <br/>
the <strike>power</strike> ^keys^ of Elijah is sealed in heaven and this is<br/>
the power of Elijah and herein is the difference between<br/>
the ^spirit and^ power of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]] and Elijah for while the spirit of<br/>
Elias is a forerunner the power of Elijah is sufficient<br/>
to make our calling and election sure; and it is<br/>
the same doctrine where we are exhorted to go on<br/>
unto perfection not laying again the foundation of <br/>
repentance from dead works but of laying on of hands<br/>
the resurrection of the dead &amp;c. We cannot be perfect<br/>
without the Fathers &amp;c. We must have revelation<br/>
then and we can see that the doctrine of revelation as<br/>
far transcends the doctrine of no revelation at all as<br/>
knowledge is above ignorance for one truth revalled<br/>
from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in existance</p>

<p>This spirit of Elijah was manifest<br/>
in the days of the Apostles in delivering certain ones<br/>
over to the buffettings of Satan that they may be<br/>
saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. They were<br/>
sealed by the spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of <br/>
hell until the day of the Lord or revelation of<br/>
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Here is the doctrine of election that<br/>
the world have quarrelled so much about but they<br/>
do not know anything concerning it. The doctrine</p>",
42658.0,29,,"<p>that the Pr<strike>e</strike>ysbeterians and Methodists have quarreled so much about<br/>
namely once in grace always in grace and on the other side the<br/>
falling away from grace [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will say a word about. They are<br/>
both wrong. Truth takes the road between. The Prysbeterian<br/>
says once in grace you cannot fall. The Methodist says<br/>
you can have grace to day fall from it to-morrow next<br/>
day have grace again and so follow it on. But the <br/>
doctrine of the Scriptures and the spirit of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] would<br/>
show them both false and take the road between.<br/>
According to the Scriptures if a man has received the good<br/>
word of God and tasted of the powers of the world to come<br/>
if he shall fall away it is impossible to renew him<br/>
again seeing that he has crucified the Son of God<br/>
afresh and put him to an open shame</p>

<p>So there is a possibility of falling<br/>
^away^ yet could not be renewed again and the power of Elijah cannot<br/>
seal against this sin for this is a reserve made in the<br/>
seals and power of the Priesthood.</p>

<p>I will make every doctrine plain<br/>
that I present and it shall stand upon a firm basis<br/>
and I am at the defiance of the world for I will take<br/>
shelter under the broad cover of the wings of the work<br/>
in which I am engaged. It matters not to me if all <br/>
hell boils over. I regard it only as I would the crackling of<br/>
the thorns under the pot</p>

<p>A murderer for instance—one<br/>
who has shed inocent blood cannot have forgiveness<br/>
[[David (OT)|David]] sought repentance at the hand of God carefully<br/>
with tears; but he could only get it through hell. He<br/>
obtained a promise that his soul should not be left in <br/>
hell. Although David was king he never did obtain <br/>
the Spirit and Power of Elijah and the fulness of<br/>
the Priesthood and the priesthood that he received and</p>",
42658.0,30,,"<p>and the throne and kingdom of [[David (OT)|David]] are to be taken from<br/>
him and given to another by the name of David in<br/>
the last days raised up out of his lineage.</p>

<p>[[Peter (NT)|Peter]] refered to the same subject<br/>
on the day of Penticost but the multitude did not get<br/>
the endowment which Peter had; but several days after<br/>
the people asked ""what shall we do?"" Speaking of their<br/>
crucifying the Lord Peter said ""I wot that through ignorance<br/>
ye did it as did also your rulers"" He did not say to<br/>
them repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins<br/>
but he said ""Repent ye therefore and be converted that your<br/>
sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing<br/>
shall come from the presence of the Lord."" This is the<br/>
case with murderers. They could not be baptized for <br/>
the remission of sins for they had shed inocent blood</p>

<p>Again to the doctrine of the sealing<br/>
power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]]. <strike>is that</strike> If you have power to seal on earth<br/>
and in heaven then you should be wise. The first thing<br/>
you do go and seal on earth your sons and daughters unto<br/>
yourself and yourself unto your fathers in eternal glory<br/>
and go ahead and not go back. Use a little craftiness<br/>
and seal all you can and when you get to heaven tell<br/>
your father ^that^ what you sealed on earth should be sealed in<br/>
heaven. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will walk through the gate of heaven and<br/>
claim what I seal and those that follow me and my<br/>
counsel.</p>

<p>The Lord once told me that what I asked<br/>
for I should have. I have been afraid to ask God to<br/>
kill my enemies lest some of them should peradventure<br/>
repent. I asked a short time since for the Lord to<br/>
deliver me out of the hands of the [[Thomas Reynolds|Governor]] of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
and if needs be to accomplish it to take him away<br/>
and the next news which came pouring down from</p>",
42658.0,31,,"<p>there was that Governor [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] had shot himself</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] would now say Beware O Earth how you<br/>
fight against the Saints and shed inocent blood for in the days<br/>
of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] when his enemies came upon him fire ^was^ called down from<br/>
heaven and destroyed them</p>

<p>The Spirit of [[Elias (OT)|Elias]] is first Elijah second<br/>
and Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way<br/>
and the spirit and power of Elijah is to come after holding the<br/>
keys of power, building the Temple to the cap-stone, placing<br/>
the seals of the Melchezedec Priesthood upon the house of<br/>
Israel and making all things ready. Then Messiah<br/>
comes to his Temple which is last of all</p>

<p>Messiah is above the spirit and power <br/>
of Elijah for he made the world and was that spiritual<br/>
rock unto [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] in the wilderness. Elijah was to come<br/>
and prepare the way and build up the kingdom before the <br/>
coming of the great day of the Lord though the spirit of<br/>
Elias was to begin it.</p>

<p>I have asked the Lord concerning his<br/>
coming and while asking the Lord gave me a sign and<br/>
said ""In the days of [[Noah (OT)|Noah]] I set a bow in the heavens as<br/>
a sign and token. In any year that the bow shall be<br/>
seen the Lord will not come but there shall be sead time<br/>
and harvest during that year. But whenever you see the<br/>
bow withdraw it shall be a token that there shall be<br/>
famine pestelence and great distress among the nations</p>

<p>But I will take the responsibility upon <br/>
myself to prophesy in the name of the Lord that Christ<br/>
will not come as Miller has prophesied for we have seen<br/>
the bow and I also prophesy in the name of the Lord that<br/>
<u>Christ</u> <u>will</u> <u>not</u> <u>come</u> <u>in</u> <u>forty</u> <u>years</u> and if ever the Lord <br/>
spake by my mouth he will not come in that time<br/>
Jesus never did reveal to any man the precise time</p>",
42658.0,32,,"<p>that he would come. Go and read the scriptures and you<br/>
cannot find any part which specifies the exact time of his<br/>
coming and all who say so are false teachers. There are <br/>
some important things concerning the office of the Messiah<br/>
in the organization of the <strike>kingdom of God</strike> ^world^ of which [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] <br/>
will speak hereafter.""</p>

<p>[FIGURE]</p>

<p>The Sunday <strike>fortnight</strike> ^two weeks^ when I arrived at<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] Joseph was speaking. He said</p>

<p>""I have been informed by two gentlemen<br/>
that a conspiracy is got up in this place for the purpose<br/>
of taking the life of President Joseph Smith his family<br/>
and all the Smith family and also the heads of the<br/>
Church. One of the gentlemen will give his name<br/>
to the public and the other wishes it to be hid for<br/>
the present. They will both testify to it on oath<br/>
and make an affadavit upon it. The names of the <br/>
persons revealled at the head of the conspiracy are [[Chauncy Lawson Higbee|Chaucy<br/>
Higby]] Dr [[Charles Ambrose Foster|Foster]] Mr [[Joseph H. Jackson|Jackson]] and [[William Law|William]] and [[Wilson Law|Wilson Law]]<br/>
And the lies which Highby has hatched up as a foundation<br/>
is—he says that I had mens heads cut off in [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
and that I had a sword run through the hearts of the<br/>
people whom I wanted to kill and out of the way.</p>

<p>I wont sware out a warrant against<br/>
them for I do not fear any of them. They would not scare <br/>
off an old setting hen. I intend to publish all the iniquity<br/>
that I know of them. If I am guilty I am ready to<br/>
bear it. There is honour among enemies. I am<br/>
willing to do anything for the good of the people. I<br/>
will give the name of one of the gentlemen who have<br/>
devulged the plot. His name is [[Merinus G. Eaton|Eaton]]. He will<br/>
sware to it. He is a bold fellow. Jackson said</p>",
42658.0,33,,"<p>a Smith should not be alive two weeks not over two months anyhow<br/>
As concerning the character of these men [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will say nothing about it<br/>
now but if I hear any more from them upon this subject I will tell<br/>
all I know about them""</p>

<p>[[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] and [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] followed with<br/>
addresses to the Assembly and then Joseph again arose and<br/>
remarked upon a point of Sidney's discourse. He said</p>

<p>In relation to the power <strike>of</strike> ^over^ the minds<br/>
of mankind which I hold I would say it is in consequence<br/>
of the power ^of truth^ in the doctrines which I have been an instru-<br/>
ment in the hands of God of presenting unto them and<br/>
not because of any compusion on my part. I will ask<br/>
if I ever got any of it unfair?—if I have not reproved you <br/>
in the gate? I ask did I ever exercise compulsion over<br/>
any man? Did I not give him the liberty of disbelieving<br/>
any doctrine I preached if he saw fit? Why do not<br/>
my enemies strike a blow at my doctrine? They<br/>
cannot do it. It is truth; and I am as the voice<br/>
of one crying in the wilderness. ""Repent of your sins<br/>
and prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man<br/>
for the Kingdom of God has come unto you and <br/>
hence forth the axe is laid unto the root of the tree<br/>
and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit God<br/>
Almighty (and not Jo Smith) shall hew down <br/>
and cast into the fire""</p>

<p>Twelve days later I attended the<br/>
dedication of the [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo Masonic Lodge]]. This was<br/>
the first Masonic dedication I ever attended. The <br/>
procession was composed of about five hundred members<br/>
and the whole was grand and imposing</p>

<p>In the fore part of the day President<br/>
Joseph Smith was to have preached the funeral sermon</p>",
42658.0,34,1844-04-06,"<p>of [[King Follett|King Follet]] one of the Masonic Brotherhood but in consequence<br/>
of ill health [[Joseph Smith Jr.|he]] omitted it and called upon Elder [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]<br/>
to address the multitude who had assembled on purpose to <br/>
hear the funeral discourse from Joseph.</p>

<p>The day following this was the anniversary<br/>
of the Church which opened our anual General Conference</p>

<p>General Conference<br/>
of the<br/>
Church of Jesus Christ of L. S. D [L. D. S.]<br/>
held at Nauvoo<br/>
<time datetime=""",04/06/1844
42658.0,34,1844-04-07,""">April 6th A.D. 1844</time>.</p>

<p>Conference commenced at 10 am. President [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]] called the Conference to order. The Prophet<br/>
then said that he should not occupy time in speaking<br/>
of any differences which might have occurred in our<br/>
midst. He said he was <u>not</u> <u>a</u> <u>Fallen</u> <u>Prophet</u><br/>
and never sustained a nearer relationship to God than<br/>
at the present time and would show before the<br/>
conference closed that God was with him</p>

<p>[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] afterwards spoke<br/>
and during the Conference of the several days he<br/>
delivered three important discourses of which I reported a<br/>
synopsis in my journal and which will be found embodied<br/>
in the History of Joseph Smith</p>

<p>On the <strike>3rd Sunday of the</strike> ^2nd day of con^ <br/>
Sunday the <time datetime=""",04/07/1844
42658.0,34,,""">7th</time> in the afternoon the Prophet Joseph <br/>
delivered one of the most important discourses of his<br/>
life to about <strike>ten</strike> ^twenty^ thousand souls upon the subject <br/>
of the death of King Follet.</p>",
42658.0,35,,"<p><u>Joseph's Great Discourse</u><br/>
(<u>recorded</u> <u>in</u> <u>my</u> <u>Journal</u>)</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] now call the attention of this congregation<br/>
while I address you upon the subject of the dead.</p>

<p>The case of our beloved brother [[King Follett|King<br/>
Follet]] who was crushed to death in a well, as also many<br/>
others who have lost friends will be had in mind this afternoon<br/>
and I shall speak upon the subject in general as far as I<br/>
shall be inspired by the Holy Spirit to treat upon it</p>

<p>I want the prayers and faith of the <br/>
Saints that I might have the Holy Ghost so that the<br/>
testimony may carry conviction to your minds of the<br/>
truth of what I shall say and I pray that the Lord<br/>
may strengthen my lungs. There is strength here and<br/>
your prayers will be heard.</p>

<p>Before I enter upon an investigation <br/>
of this subject I wish to pave the way and bring up<br/>
the subject from the beginning that you may understand<br/>
I do not intend to please you with oratory but with the<br/>
simple truths of heaven to edify you.</p>

<p>Go to the morn of Creation to understand<br/>
the decrees of Eloheim at the creation. It is necessary<br/>
that we have an understanding of God at the beginning.<br/>
If we get a good start at first we can go right but if<br/>
you start wrong you may go wrong</p>

<p>But few understand the character<br/>
of God. They do not know Him they do not <br/>
understand their relationship to Him. The world know<br/>
no more than the brute beast. They know no more<br/>
than to eat drink and sleep. This is all man knows<br/>
about God or His existance ^except^ what is given by the inspiration</p>",
42658.0,36,,"<p>of the Almighty.</p>

<p>Go then to the beginning that you may<br/>
understand. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] ask this congregation what kind of a<br/>
being is God? Turn your thoughts in your own<br/>
hearts and say have any of you seen or heard Him<br/>
or communed with Him. This is a question which<br/>
may occupy your attention. The scriptures informs us<br/>
that this is eternal life to know thee the only true and<br/>
living God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. If<br/>
any enquire What kind of a being God is I would say<br/>
if you do not know Him you have not eternal life<br/>
Go back and find out what kind of a being God is.<br/>
If I am the man that shows you what kind of being <br/>
God is then let every man and woman sit in silence<br/>
and never lift up the hand against me again. If I<br/>
do not this I will make no more pretentions to<br/>
inspiration or to be a Prophet. I should be like the<br/>
rest of the world a false teacher and you would want<br/>
to take my life. But you might just as well<br/>
take the lives of other false teachers as mine if I<br/>
was false. But meddle not with any man for his<br/>
religion. Every Government ought to <strike>protect</strike> ^permit^ every man<br/>
to enjoy his religion</p>

<p>I will show the world is wrong by<br/>
showing what God is. I am going to enquire<br/>
after Him so that you may know God that persecution<br/>
may cease concerning me. I will go back to the<br/>
beginning to show what kind of a being God was. I<br/>
will tell you and hear it O Earth! <u>God</u> <u>who</u> <u>sits</u> <u>in</u><br/>
<u>Yonder</u> <u>heavens</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>man</u> <u>like</u> <u>unto</u> <u>yourselves</u>.<br/>
That God if you were to see Him to day who holds<br/>
the worlds you would see Him like a man in form<br/>
like yourselves. [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] was made in His</p>",
42658.0,37,,"<p>image and talked and walked with Him</p>

<p>In order to understand the dead for the<br/>
consolation of those who mourn [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] want you to understand God and<br/>
how he came to be God. We have supposed that God was God <br/>
from eternity. I will refute that idea or I will take away<br/>
the veil so that you may see. It is one of the first principles<br/>
to know that we may converse with Him. He was once a<br/>
man like unto us and the Father was once on an earth<br/>
like us, and I wish I was in a suitabll place to tell it</p>

<p>The scriptures inform us, mark it, that<br/>
Jesus Christ said ""As the Father hath power in Himself so<br/>
hath the Son power in Himself."" <strike>S</strike>To do what? That Father did even<br/>
to lay down <strike>my</strike> ^his^ body and take it up again. Do you believe<br/>
it? If not you do not believe the Bible. I will defy all hell and<br/>
earth to refute this. And you have got to learn how to become<br/>
<strike>yourself</strike> ^a^ God king and priest by going from a small capacity<br/>
to a great capacity, to the resurrection of the dead and to<br/>
dwelling in everlasting burning. I want you to learn the<br/>
first principle of this order</p>

<p>How consoling to the mourners when<br/>
they part with their friends to know that though they lay down<br/>
this body it will rise and dwell in everlasting burning<br/>
to be an heir of God and joint heir with Jesus Christ<br/>
enjoying the same exaltation and glory until you arrive at<br/>
the station of a God</p>

<p>What did Jesus Christ do? ""The<br/>
same as I see the Father do."" See the Father do what?<br/>
""Work out a kingdom. When I have done so too I will<br/>
give it up to the Father which will add to His glory<br/>
He will then take a higher exaltation and I shall <br/>
take His place and be also exalted""</p>

<p>These are the first principles of <br/>
the Gospel. It will take a long time after the</p>",
42658.0,38,,"<p>grave to understand the whole</p>

<p>If [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] should say anything but what was in<br/>
the Bible the cry of treason would be heard. I will then<br/>
go to the Bible and will make a comment on the very<br/>
first sentence of the history of the Creation—<u>Berosheit</u>. I want<br/>
to analize the word; baith, in, by, through and everything<br/>
else. <u>Rosh</u>, the head; <u>sheit</u>, gramatical termination<br/>
When the inspired man wrote it he did not put the <u>baith</u><br/>
there; an old Jew without any authority added the word: he<br/>
thought it too bad to begin to talk about the head. It reat at <br/>
first ""The head one of the Gods brought forth the Gods"": that is<br/>
the true meaning of the words. <u>Baurau</u> signifies to<br/>
bring forth. If you do not believe it you do not <br/>
believe the learned man of God. Learned men can<br/>
teach you no more than what I have told you. Thus <br/>
the head God brought forth the Gods in the Grand Council<br/>
I will transpose it in the English language. I want you to<br/>
know and learn that the Holy Ghost knows something.<br/>
The Grand Council sat at the head and contemplated the<br/>
Creation of the world. Some will say the scriptures<br/>
^say^ so and so; but I will show you a test out of an old<br/>
edition of the New Testament in the Hebrew Latin<br/>
German and Greek languages. In the 21 verse of the<br/>
fourth ch. of Mathew our common translation says<br/>
[[James (NT)|James]] the Son of Zebedee but this old book in my<br/>
possession says Jacob the Son of Zebedee in each of the<br/>
four languages—the Hebrew Latin German and Greek<br/>
The doctors (I mean the doctors of the law) say if you<br/>
preach anything not according to the Bible we will cry<br/>
treason; but if ye are not led by revelation How can ye <br/>
escape the damnation of hell. Here we have the testimony<br/>
of four against one—the present translation. I have the oldest<br/>
book in the world and the Holy Ghost besides. I thank God<br/>
for the old book but more for the Holy Ghost.</p>",
42658.0,39,,"<p>In the beginning the head of the Gods called a council of<br/>
the Gods and they came together and concocted a plan to create the world and people<br/>
it. Having a knowledge of God and what kind of a being he is we know <br/>
how to approach him and how to ask so as to receive an answer.</p>

<p>Another thing, the learned say the Lord made the world out of nothing and they account it <br/>
blasphemy in any one to contradict their idea. If you tell them God made the<br/>
world out of something they will account you a fool. But I am more learned in the<br/>
things of God than they and know more than all the world put together: the Holy Ghost does<br/>
anyhow and he is within [[Joseph Smith Jr.|me]] and comprehends more than all the world and I will<br/>
associate myself with him; They infer from the word create that the world must<br/>
have been made out of nothing. Now the word create came from the word <u>Baurau</u><br/>
and does not mean to create out of nothing but to organize the same as a man would o[r]ganize<br/>
materials to build a ship. Element had an existance, from the time God had. It can be organized<br/>
and reorganized but not destroyed. I have another subject to speak upon calculated to exalt man<br/>
It is associated with the subject of the ressurection of the dead--namely, the soul<br/>
the mind of man, the immortal spirit, where did it come<br/>
from? The learned say God made it in the beginning<br/>
But it is not so. I know better. God has told me<br/>
If you do not believe it that will not make the truth<br/>
without effect. God was a self-existing being. Man<br/>
exists upon the same principle. God made a tabernacle<br/>
and put the spirit into it and man became a human<br/>
soul. Man existed in spirit and mind co-equal<br/>
with God Himself</p>

<p>You who mourn the loss of friends<br/>
are only seperated from them but for a moment.<br/>
The spirit is seperated for a little time but they are <br/>
conversant with each other as we are on earth. I am<br/>
dwelling on the immutibility of the spirit of man<br/>
Is it logic to say the Spirit of man had a beginning<br/>
and yet has no end? It does not have either a<br/>
beginning or end. My ring is like the existance<br/>
of the soul of man. It has no beginning or end. If<br/>
it were cut in two there would be both a beginning<br/>
and an end. So with man. If he had a beginning <br/>
he would also have an end.</p>

<p>If I am right I might say God never<br/>
had power to create the Spirit of man. God Himself<br/>
could not create himself. Intelligence is eternal</p>",
42658.0,40,,"<p>and it is self-existing. All mind is succeptible of improvement<br/>
The relationship we sustain with God places us in a situation<br/>
to advance in knowledge. God has power to institute laws<br/>
to instructe the lesser intelligences that they may be exalted<br/>
with Himself. This is good doctrine. It tastes good<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] can taste the principles of eternal life. So can you<br/>
They are given to me by the revelations of Jesus Christ<br/>
and I know you believe it. All that which God<br/>
sees fit to reveal in relation to us makes known his<br/>
will to our spirits precisely as though we had no bodies<br/>
at all and those revelations which will save our spirits will<br/>
also save our bodies: hence the awful responsibility which rests<br/>
upon us in relation to our dead for all the spirits who have not<br/>
obeyed the Gospel in the flesh must obey it in the spirit or be<br/>
damned. Would to God I had forty days and nights in which<br/>
to tell you all; I would let you know that I am not<br/>
'a fallen Prophet.'</p>

<p>The greatest responsibility laid upon us in this<br/>
life is to seek after our dead. The Apostle says they<br/>
without us cannot be made perfect for it is necessary that<br/>
the sealing powers should be in our hands to seal our children<br/>
and our dead for the fulness of the dispensation of times --<br/>
a dispensation to meet the promises made by Jesus Christ<br/>
before the foundation of the world for the salvation of man<br/>
It is necessary that those who are gone before and those who come<br/>
after us should have Salvation in common with us and thus<br/>
has God made it obligatory upon man. Hence He has said<br/>
I will send [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] the Prophet to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children</p>

<p>From before the foundation of the world God hath<br/>
made provisions to suit the conditions of man. Jesus said, ""All<br/>
sins and blasphemy except the sin against the Holy Ghost should<br/>
be forgiven and there is a salvation for all either in this<br/>
world or the world to come who have not committed the unpardonable</p>",
42658.0,41,,"<p>sin. God has made provision that every spirit in the eternal world can be<br/>
saved unless he has committed this sin and the spirits of our friends<br/>
can be searched out and saved. Any man who has a friend in eternity<br/>
can save him if he has not committed the unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>A man cannot commit the unpardonable sin after the<br/>
dissolution of the body and there is a possibility of his escape. If a<br/>
man has knowledge he can be saved. If he has been guilty<br/>
of great sins he is punished for them. When he consents to<br/>
obey the Gospel whether alive or dead he is saved.</p>

<p>A man's own mind damns him. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]]<br/>
have no fear of hell fire. It does not exist. The torment<br/>
of disapointment in the mind of man is as a lake burning<br/>
with fire and brimstone. <strike>I</strike></p>

<p>No man can commit the unpardonable<br/>
sin until he receives the Holy Ghost and then it must be<br/>
done in this world and cannot be committed after the<br/>
dissolution of the body. Hence the salvation of Jesus <br/>
Christ wrought for all men triumphs over the devil<br/>
for even he stood up as a Saviour. All <strike>who</strike> ^must^ suffer until<br/>
they obey Christ himself.</p>

<p>The contention in heaven was--Jesus said<br/>
there would be souls who would not be saved and the Devil<br/>
said he could save them all and laid his plans before the<br/>
grand Council who gave their vote in favour of Jesus Christ<br/>
So the devil rose up in rebellion against god and was cast<br/>
down with all who put up their hands for him.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ will save all except the sons <br/>
of Perdition. What must a man do to commit the <strike>unpar-</strike><br/>
unpardonable sin. He must receive<strike>d</strike> the Holy Ghost have<br/>
the heavens opened to him and know God and then sin<br/>
against <u>Him</u>. After a man has sinned against the<br/>
Holy Ghost there is no repentance for him. He has got to<br/>
say the sun does not shine while he sees it; he has got to</p>",
42658.0,42,,"<p>to deny Jesus Christ when the heavens have been opened to him and<br/>
to deny the plan of Salvation with his eyes open to the truth and from <br/>
that time he begins to be an enemy. This is the case with many apostates<br/>
of the Church. They never cease to try to hurt me and thirst for my<br/>
blood; they have the Spirit of the devil which crucified the Lord of<br/>
Life--the same that sins against the Holy Ghost. You cannot<br/>
save them. They make open war like the Devil.</p>

<p>If a spirit of bitterness is in you dont be in haste. You may say <br/>
that man is a sinner. Well if he repents he shall be forgiven. Be<br/>
cautious. When you find a spirit that wants murder the same<br/>
is of the devil.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] could go back and trace every subject of interest concerning the<br/>
relationship of man to God if I had time and enter largely into the<br/>
eternal worlds. Jesus says there are many mansions in my Fathers<br/>
Kingdom and [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] says there is one glory of the Sun another of the Moon<br/>
another of the Stars for one Star differeth from another star in glory<br/>
So also is the resurrection of the dead. What have we to console us in<br/>
relation to our dead? The greatest hope of any people on earth. We <br/>
have seen them walk worthily in our midst and <strike>sink</strike> ^fall^ asteep [asleep] in<br/>
the arms of Jesus and those who have died in the faith are now<br/>
in the celestial Kingdom of God. They have gone to await the resurrection<br/>
of the dead to go into celestial glory while there are many who will<br/>
have to wait myri[a]ds of years before they can receive the like<br/>
blessings. I am authorized to say to you by the authority of the <br/>
Holy Ghost that you have no occasion to fear. You may wait for<br/>
your friends to meet you in the morn of the celestial world.<br/>
Those who have been murdered in the persecution shall triumph gloriously<br/>
in the celestial world while their murder<strike>s</strike>ers shall dwell in torment for<br/>
ages until they have paid the uttermost farthing</p>

<p>I have a father brothers chrildren and friends who ^have^ gone <strike>f</strike>to a <br/>
world of spirits. They are only absent for a moment, and we shall soon meet<br/>
again. The time will soon arrive when the trumphet shall sound. When we<br/>
depart we shall hail our mothers, fathers, friends and all whom we love who<br/>
have fallen asleep in Jesus. There will be no fear of mobs &amp;c. It will be an<br/>
eternity of felicity. [FIGURE]</p>

<p>A question may be asked will mothers have their<br/>
children in eternity. Yes yes mothers. You shall have your children</p>",
42658.0,43,,"<p>for they shall have eternal life; for their debt is paid. There is no damnation awaiting<br/>
them. They are in the Spirit. But as the child dies so shall it rise from the dead and<br/>
be forever living in the learning of God. It will never grow. It will still be the child<br/>
in the same precise form as it appeared before it died out of its mothers<br/>
arms but possessing all the intelligence of a God. Children dwell in the mansions of<br/>
glory and exe<strike>cr</strike>rcise power but appear in the same form as when on earth. Eternity<br/>
is full of thrones upon which dwell thousands of children regning on thrones of<br/>
glory with not one cubit added to their stature.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will leave this subject here and make a few remarks<br/>
upon the subject of baptism. The baptism of water without the baptism of<br/>
fire and the Holy Ghost is of no use. They are inseperably connected. An<br/>
individual must be born of water and the spirit in order to enter the Kingdom<br/>
of God. In German the text bears me out the same as the revelations which<br/>
I have given and taught for the last fourteen years on that subject. You<br/>
will find it in the declaration of [Baptist, John the (NT)|[John the Baptist]].   -[<u>reads from the German</u>]-<br/>
John says ""I baptize you with water, but when Jesus comes who has the<br/>
power (or keys) he shall administer the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost""</p>

<p>There is one God one Father one Jesus one hope of our calling one<br/>
baptism. All these three baptisms only make one. Many talk of baptism<br/>
not being essential to salvation; but this kind of teaching would lay the<br/>
foundation of their damnation. I have the truth and am at the<br/>
defiance of the world to contradict me if they can</p>

<p>Hear it all ye ends of the earth—all ye Priests—all ye sinners<br/>
and all men,—Repent, repent! obey the Gospel; turn to God for your<br/>
religion wont save you, and you will be damned: I do not say how long.<br/>
There have been remarks made concerning all men being redeemed from hell<br/>
but I say that those who sin against the Holy Ghost cannot be forgiven<br/>
in this world or the world to come. They shall die the second death. Those <br/>
who commit the unpardonable sin are doomed to <u>Gnolom</u>, to dwell in<br/>
hell worlds without end. As they concoct scenes of bloodshed in this world so<br/>
they shall rise to that resurrection which is as the lake of fire and brimstone<br/>
Some shall rise to the everlasting burning of God, for God dwells in everlasting<br/>
burnings and some shall rise to the damnation of their own filthiness<br/>
which is as exquisite a torment as the lake of fire and brimstone</p>

<p>I have no enmity against any man. I love you all but<br/>
I hate some of your deeds. I am your best friend and if persons miss<br/>
their mark it is their own fault. If I reprove a man and he hates me<br/>
he is a fool for I love all men especially these my brethren and sisters</p>

<p>I rejoice to hear the testimony of some of my aged<br/>
friends. You dont know me. You never knew my heart. No<br/>
man knows my history. I cannot tell it. I shall never<br/>
undertake it. I dont blame anyone for not believing my <br/>
history. If I had not experienced what I have I could not<br/>
have believed it myself. I never did harm any man since<br/>
I was born into the world. My voice is always for peace.</p>

<p><u>I cannot lie</u> <u>down until</u> <u>all my work is finished.</u><br/>
I never think any evil nor do anything to the harm of my fellow<br/>
man. When I am called by the trumph of the archangel<br/>
and weighed in the balance you will all know me then.</p>

<p>I add no more God bless you all. Amen</p>",

42658.0,44,,""">April the 8th</time><br/>
when [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] arose and said it was impossible for him to<br/>
continue the subject of the previous day in consequence of the<br/>
weakness of his lungs. But among his brief remarks was<br/>
one of the most important revelations of the age. He said</p>

<p>Yet I have</p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Great</u> <u>Proclamation</u></p>

<p>It is in relation to Zion and a proclamation for the<br/>
Elders to teach the Church hereafter. The whole of <br/>
[[South America|South]] &amp; [[North America|North America]] is Zion and the mountain of the<br/>
Lord's house is in the centre of North and South America<br/>
When the House is done the baptismal font erected<br/>
and finished and the worthy are washed anointed endowed &amp;<br/>
^ordained^ kings and priests which must be done in this life --<br/>
and when the place is prepared you must also go through<br/>
all the ordinances of the house of the Lord and if<br/>
you have any dead relations for them also the same<br/>
as for yourselves -- then the Elders are to go through all<br/>
America and build up Churches until all Zion is built<br/>
up. But this is not to commence until this [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] <br/>
is built and the Elders are endowed. Then go forth<br/>
and accomplish the work and build up stakes in<br/>
all North and South America. There will be some<br/>
place ordained for the redeeming of the dead. I think<br/>
this will be the one.""</p>

<p>He also remarked that this proclamation<br/>
was the greatest ever made to us as all could not<br/>
come here but it was necessary that enough should<br/>
come to build up the Temple and get an endowment so<br/>
that the work could spread abroad</p>

<p>Joseph's lungs failed him and he called<br/>
upon [[George Washington Joshua Adams|George J. Adams]] to occupy the forenoon</p>",
42658.0,45,1844-05-04,"<p>At the close of the morning's meeting President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph<br/>
Smith]] turned over the Conference into the hands of the Twelve<br/>
and it continued through the next day under the presidency<br/>
of [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and then adjourned to the following<br/>
Saturday to re-assemble at 2 o clock to hear a political<br/>
address from Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]].</p>

the 9th</time> I arose in the morning arranged some domestic<br/>
affairs and parted from my wife and children for the<br/>
purpose of taking my summer's mission through the<br/>
United States to attend the General Conferences<br/>
For the last ten years of my life with the exception of<br/>
one it had been my lot to be in the vineyard every<br/>
Summer. I left Nauvoo in company with<br/>
Elders [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] and [[Ezra Thayer|Ezra Thayer]]</p>",
42658.0,46,,"<p>and his son.</p>

<p>This was the last mission ever [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
the Prophet gave to the Twelve Apostles of this dispensation<br/>
He wished none of us to remain with the exception of [[Willard Richards|Willard<br/>
Richards]]. He told [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] he wanted hi<strike>s</strike>m to<br/>
go especially on this mission with his quorum and he<br/>
spoke with much earnestness. He also turned to me<br/>
and said brother Woodruff I want you to go and if<br/>
you do not you will die. It rested with weight upon <br/>
my mind at the time he spoke and I have often thought<br/>
since when musing over the awful catastrophy of his &amp; [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrums]]<br/>
martyrdom how true his words might have been had I<br/>
remained. Elder Taylor did remain and he and Willard<br/>
Richards <u>the only ones of the Twelve left in Nauvoo where</u><br/>
with him in prison at his assassination. Had more<br/>
of us been there with him in Nauvoo we might some<br/>
of us have met the death which Elder John Taylor<br/>
but barely escaped. <strike>having received</strike></p>

<p>It might have been that Willard Richards who was the<br/>
only one whom Joseph wished to stay with him of the<br/>
Twelve was also the only one of us who could stay with<br/>
him <strike>unhurt</strike> ^safely^ and he passed through that awful scene <br/>
of the martyrdom of our Prophet and Patriarch safe<br/>
from personal harm.</p>

<p>I took the parting hand of Joseph<br/>
and Hyrum at their own dwelling. Joseph was<br/>
standing in his own entery when I took his hand to<br/>
bid him farewell. Brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] was with<br/>
me. As he took me by the hand he said<br/>
""Brother Woodruff, you are now about to start upon<br/>
your mission."" I answered ""Yes."" He looked<br/>
me steadily in the eye for a time without speaking<br/>
He looked as though he would penetrate my very</p>",
42658.0,47,1844-05-18,"<p>soul but at the same time seemed unspeakably sorrowful as<br/>
though [[Joseph Smith Jr.|he]] was weighed down with a foreboding of something<br/>
dreadful in the future. He finally spoke in a mournful<br/>
voice—""God bless you Brother Woodruff! Go in pea<strike>s</strike>ce!""<br/>
I turned and left him with a sorrowful heart partaking<br/>
of the same spirit that rested upon him. This was the <br/>
last time I ever saw his face or heard his voice again [x].</p>

also held another meeting for the same object and had <br/>
quite a time in political spirit ^matter^ and the impression <br/>

sat together in the Station was very sorrowful and depressed in spirit<br/>
without knowing the cause. This was the time that the direst blow<br/>
which Satan had struck since the Son of God was crucified sent the<br/>
spirits of the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] and Patriarch to join the martyred host of God's servants<br/>

<p>The Melodian was crowded in<br/>
the evening and it was soon evident that a large number<br/>
of rowdies were in the galleries and disposed to make<br/>
disturbance. Among ^others^ [[Abby Folsom|Abby Folsom]] made her <br/>
appearance and arose and commenced speaking while<br/>
the President of the convention was addressing the</p>",

in which he was encouraged by his companions until confusion became<br/>
general in the gallery. The police came in to take the<br/>
young man out but they were badly beaten by a set of <br/>
young desperadoes. After much hard fighting however the<br/>
officers succeeded in clearing the gallery of the rowdies but the<br/>
meeting was also soon broken up</p>

<p>The convention was adjourned until the next<br/>

company with [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and old companion<br/>
and fellow labourer in the ministry whom I had not <br/>
met for five years. We left [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] at 7 o clock p.m.</p>

father and [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|mother]] and her brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Fabyan]] and family<br/>

with my brother-in-law [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra Carter]] and was about to take<br/>
steam boat in the evening for [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomastown]] and [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]]<br/>
but in the afternoon we obtained the Boston Times<br/>
containing the solemn information of the assassination of the<br/>
Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]</p>

<p>Next day I took the cars for [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]]<br/>
and on the following met with the Saints. They mourned<br/>
the loss of the Prophet and Patriarch yet through our meeting<br/>
they were strengthened in the faith and the comfort of the<br/>
Spirit was with us so that we had a good time together</p>

<p>On the morrow I wrote a letter<br/>
to the Editor of the Prophet published in [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]]<br/>
by the friends of our martyred leader giving a word<br/>
of exhortation to the Saints abroad to maintain their<br/>
integrity and keep the faith and paitence of the<br/>
saints unto death</p>

<p>The following morning we obtained<br/>
information from [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] as late as June 29th giving<br/>
full accounts of the horrid affair at [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] and the<br/>
tremendious loss which the Church had sustained.<br/>

and Hyrum to be a wanton murder. The State of<br/>
[[Illinois|Illinois]] was in commotion and <strike>the</strike> Governor Ford had<br/>
made Quincy his head quarters and issued a proclamation<br/>
to the citizens of the state. The news of the day<br/>
stated that the Mormon Leaders in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] had done<br/>
all they could to restrain the disciples of the martyred<br/>
Prophet from vengeance still there was evidently a<br/>
disposition of both the people and the troops to destroy<br/>
Nauvoo lest the Mormons should hold a fearful<br/>

<p>We had not heard from any of our brethren<br/>
of the calamity which had fallen upon us in the great b<strike>re</strike>erevement<br/>
of the Church but as I arose on the morning of the <time datetime=""",07/16/1844

letters were handed to me one from [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] and the other<br/>
from [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] confirming the martyrdom of the Prophet <br/>
and Patriarch.</p>

<p>I immediately wrote three letters to [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]] and sent one to [[Peterborough, Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Peterboro]] N. H. one to [[Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Lowell]]<br/>
and one to [[Bradford, Essex County, Massachusetts|Bradford]] Mass. I then went direct to the<br/>
post office and took out a letter directed to [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] from<br/>
his [[Bathsheba Wilson Bigler Smith|wife]] in which Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] wrote a few lines to me<br/>
which was the first intelligence I had from her since I left <br/>
home. She related to me a dream which Joseph had<br/>
a few days before he sealed his testimony with his blood</p>

<p>He thought that [[William Law|William]] and [[Wilson Law|Wilson<br/>
Law]] bound him and cast him into a pit or well<br/>
like as [[Joseph (OT)|Joseph]] was anciently. He struggled hard<br/>
and got up so that he could look out and he saw<br/>
the Laws a little distance off one of them in the<br/>
grasp of a tigar and the other in that of a snake<br/>
They called to Him to come and help them but he told them<br/>
they had bound him and he could not; and he thought<br/>
in his dream that a brother soon came along and took<br/>
him out of the pit.</p>

<p>On the following day <time datetime=""",07/17/1844

with him to 57 Temple Street and called upon</p>",
42658.0,54,,"<p>Sister [[Mary Polly Vose|Vose]]. Brother [[Brigham Young|Young]] took the bed and I the arm<br/>
chair and here we veiled our faces and gave vent to our<br/>
grief. Until now I had not shed a tear since I heard<br/>
of the death of the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] but my soul had felt nerved<br/>
up like steel. After giving vent to our grief in tears<br/>
we felt more composed. Brother Brigham left the<br/>
city again on the same day</p>

<p>On the following day Elders [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] arrived in the city<br/>
and President Brigham Young also returned and we met<br/>
together and held a council. I wrote a letter to the <br/>
Prophet advising the Elders who ha<strike>ve</strike>d families in<br/>
Nauvoo to go immediately to them and for all the<br/>
authorities of the Church to forthwith assemble at<br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] for a Council: ""<u>By</u> <u>order</u> <u>of the Quorum of</u><br/>
<u>the Twelve</u>, Wilford Woodruff clerk; Brigham Young<br/>
President. -[<u>Published in</u> <u>Deseret News Vol VII. No 44</u>]-</p>

<p>That night there was a meeting in a <br/>
hall in Washington Street opposite Boydston Hall.<br/>
Elder Orson Hyde had advertized to preach on the murder<br/>
of Joseph and Hyrum Smith at the close of which a<br/>
collection was to be taken up to pay his expences<br/>
home.</p>

<p>I reported a synopsis of his address and<br/>
recorded it in my Journal.</p>

<p>At the close of Elder Hyde's discourse<br/>
President Brigham Young arose and said he felt disposed<br/>
to add his testimony</p>

<p>""Be of good cheer. The testimony is<br/>
not in force while the Testator liveth: when he died<br/>
it was in force: so it is with Joseph. On the day<br/>
of Pentecost there were but one hundred and twenty of<br/>
the Saints but at that time there was added three<br/>
thousand souls. When God sends a man to do a</p>",

his work: So with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. He prepared all things gave the keys<br/>
to men on the earth and said I may soon be taken from you.""</p>

<p>I left [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on the <time datetime=""",07/20/1844
42658.0,55,,""">20th</time> and arrived at my<br/>
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]'s house in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] two days later. I found my father<br/>
and [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]] alone, not a child with them in their decline of<br/>
life to watch over them</p>

<p>I had but twenty four hours to stay<br/>
and I happily improved the time. My father was 67 years<br/>
of age and I might never have seen him again in mortality<br/>
and my mind had been deeply impressed of late that I<br/>
had something to do for my parents.</p>

<p>As the sable shades of a serene night<br/>
drew her curtain over the earth and stilled the cares of day<br/>
we met alone: none but congenial spirits were there. I<br/>
arose and with the spirit like that of [[Joseph (OT)|Joseph]] towards his<br/>
father [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]] opened my heart to my father and he reciprocated<br/>
my sentiments. I then laid my hands upon his head and<br/>
according to the authority of the Priesthood and Apostleship<br/>
(confered upon me under the hands of the Twelve Apostles<br/>
upon the corner stone of the house of the Lord in [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]]<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] being mouth) I ordained my<br/>
father Aphek Woodruff unto the office of an High<br/>
priest and Patriarch after the order of [[Melchizedek (OT)|Melchezedic]] <strike>and <br/>
I placed upon his head the seals of the covenant in connection<br/>
with [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Bulah Thompson]] and Azubah Hart—my own <br/>
mother and stepmother</strike> and sealed him up unto eternal<br/>
life. I shall never forget the deep satisfaction and <br/>
heavenly spirit of that night beneath my father's roof<br/>
Sleep departed from me and I was wrapt in the<br/>
meditations and visions of by gone days and the days<br/>
to come <strike>and</strike> of this life and the one hereafter.</p>",
42658.0,56,1844-07-25,"<p>The next day I again left my father's house<br/>

[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]].</p>

42658.0,56,,""">27th</time> at the railroad hotel and the next morning took steamboat<br/>
propeller Hercules for [[Chicago, Cook County, Illinois|Chicago]].</p>

<p>This was Sunday. I spent a part of <br/>
the day in writing. We had good State rooms and was<br/>
comfortable. We spoke much of our families and the death<br/>
of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], and we felt anxious to get home.</p>

<p>President Young expressed his feelings to<br/>
me upon a variety of subjects and among other things he said<br/>
he wished me to keep an account of things as he should<br/>
look to me for his journal some day. I had an<br/>
interesting time with Lyman Wight talking over old times<br/>
and looking forward to new ones</p>

<p><u>Joseph's</u> <u>Presentiment</u> <u>that</u> <u>he would</u> <u>not</u> <u>see the</u> <u>Age of Forty</u>.</p>

<p>During our conversation Lyman Whight informed me<br/>

[[Missouri|Missouri]] that he should not live to see his fortieth year<br/>
of age but bid him not to reveal it until he was dead.</p>

<p>Two nights before our arrival in Nauvoo<br/>
Elder Kimball had a dream which he related to us. He</p>",
42658.0,57,1844-08-06,"<p>thought [[Heber Chase Kimball|he]] was preaching to a large congregation upon the policy of the nation<br/>
and of the work of God, and he said [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] had laid the foundation and we<br/>
should have to carry out his measures. Joseph was himself present and heard all<br/>
and sanctioned it. All seamed perfectly natural</p>

<p>We stoped at various places going down the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]]:<br/>
among others the town of [[Burlington, Kane County, Illinois|Burlington]]. We then prepared our<br/>
minds to once more behold the City of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and embrace<br/>
our families and friends.</p>

<p><time datetime=""",08/06/1844
42658.0,57,,""">August the 6th</time> We were landed at the upper stone<br/>
house at 8 in the evening and were welcomed with joy<br/>
by all the citizens we met. We hired a coach and I<br/>
accompanied my brethren to their families after which I<br/>
was conveyed to my own and truly felt to rejoice to once<br/>
more meet with my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] children and friends.</p>

<p>When we landed in the city of Nauvoo<br/>
a deep gloom seemed to rest over it which we never experienced<br/>
before. <strike><u>This was August the 6th</u></strike></p>

<p>[FIGURE]</p>

<p>The next morning I went through the<br/>
city of Nauvoo saw many friends and net in council with<br/>
the quorum of the Twelve at Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]]'s whom we found<br/>
recovering from his wounds received at the massacre of the<br/>
Prophet and [[Hyrum Smith|Patriarch]] of the Church.</p>

<p>We felt to rejoice at again having <br/>
the privilege of meeting together in council in Nauvoo<br/>
after passing through such trying scenes and to be welcomed<br/>
by the Saints who considered it providential for the Twelve<br/>
to arrive at this particular juncture when their minds were<br/>
agitated their hearts sorrowfull and darkness seemed to<br/>
cloud their path feeling like a sheep without a shepherd their<br/>
beloved Prophet having been taken away.</p>

<p>We spent the forepart of the day in<br/>
council at brother Taylor's and in the afternoon at 4 o'clock<br/>
the Twelve the High Council and the High Priests met<br/>
at the Seventies Hall</p>",
42658.0,58,,"<p>After prayer by [[William Marks|Wm Marks]] President of the <br/>
stake President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] called upon President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]]<br/>
to make a statement to the Church concerning his message to<br/>
the Saints and the vision and revelation he had received</p>

<p>President Rigdon said, The object of my mission<br/>
is to visit the Saints and offer myself to them as a Guardian<br/>
I had a vision at [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] June the 27th. This was presented<br/>
to my mind not as an open vision but rather a continuation<br/>
of the vision mentioned in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants</p>

<p>It was shown to me that this Church must<br/>
be built up to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and that all the blessings we receive<br/>
must come through him. I have been ordained a Spokesman<br/>
to Joseph and I must come to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and see that the<br/>
Church is goverened in a proper manner. Joseph sustains the<br/>
same relationship to this Church as he has always done. No<br/>
man can be the succcessor of Joseph</p>

<p>The kingdom is to be built up to Jesus Christ<br/>
through Joseph. There must be revelation still. The<br/>
martyred Prophet is still the head of this Church. Every quorum <br/>
should stand as you stood in your washings and consecrations<br/>
I have been consecrated a spokesman to Joseph and I<br/>
was commanded to speak for him. The Church is not disorganized<br/>
though our head is gone</p>

<p>We may have a diversity of feelings<br/>
on this matter. I have been called to be a spokesman unto<br/>
Joseph and I want to build up the Church unto him and<br/>
if the people want me to sustain this place I want it upon<br/>
the principle that every individual shall acknowledge it for<br/>
himself.</p>

<p>I propose to be a Guardian to the people<br/>
In this I have discharged my duty and done what God has<br/>
commanded me and the people can please themselves<br/>
whether they accept me or not""</p>",
42658.0,59,,"<p>President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] said, ""I do not care who<br/>
leads the Church even though it were Ann Lee; but one thing<br/>
I must know and that is what God says about it. I have <br/>
the Keys and the means of obtaining the mind of God on<br/>
the subject.</p>

<p>I know there are those in our midst who<br/>
will seek the lives of the Twelve as they did the lives of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]. We shall ordain others and give the fulness<br/>
of the Priesthood so that if we are killed the fulness of the <br/>
priesthood may remain.</p>

<p>Joseph confered upon our heads all the<br/>
keys and powers belonging to the Apostleship which he<br/>
himself held before he was taken away and no man or<br/>
set of men can get between Joseph and the Twelve in<br/>
this world or in the world to come.</p>

<p>How often has Joseph said to the Twelve<br/>
I have laid the foundation and you must build thereon<br/>
for upon your shoulders the kingdom rests.</p>

<p>The Twelve as a quorum will not be<br/>
permitted to tarry here long. They will go abroad and<br/>
bear off the kingdom to the nations of the earth and baptize<br/>
the people faster than mobs can kill them off. I would<br/>
like were it my privilege to take my valise and travel and<br/>
preach until we had a people gathered who would be true.</p>

<p>My private feelings would be to let <br/>
the affairs of men and women alone &amp; only go and preach<br/>
and baptize them into the kingdom of God; yet whatever<br/>
duty God places upon me in His strength I intend to fulfill<br/>
it.</p>

then Presiding over the Stake a special meeting was held next<br/>
morning at 10 o'clock to choose a Guardian or President and<br/>
Trustee. [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] took his position in a waggon<br/>
about two rods in front of the stand and harangued the<br/>
Saints for about an hour and a half upon chosing a<br/>
Guardian for the Church. The meeting was then dismissed<br/>
when President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] gave out an appointment<br/>
for the brethren to assemble at 2 o'clock</p>

<p>At the appointed time the brethren<br/>
came together. Present of the Twelve—Brigham Young<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[Willard Richards|Willard<br/>
Richards]] Wilford Woodruff and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
The several quorums were organized on and around the <br/>
stand according to order.</p>

<p>The meeting being opened President<br/>
Brigham Young arose and said, <u>Attention</u> <u>all</u>!<br/>
This congregation makes me think of the days of king <br/>
[[Benjamin (BofM)|Benjamin]] the multitude being so great that all could<br/>
not hear. I request the brethren not to have any feelings<br/>
for being convened this afternoon for it is necessary. We<br/>
want you all to be still and give attention that all may<br/>
hear. Let none complain because of the situation of<br/>
the congregation. We will do the best we can.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life—for the<br/>
first time in your lives—for the first time in the<br/>
kingdom of God in the nineteenth century without a<br/>
prophet at our head do I step forth to act in my calling<br/>
in connection with the quorum of the Twelve as Apostles<br/>
of Jesus Christ unto this generation—Apostles whom<br/>
God has called by revelation through the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
who are ordained and anointed to bear off the keys of <br/>
the kingdom of God in all the world.</p>",
42658.0,61,,"<p>This people have hitherto walked by sight and not by<br/>
faith. You have had the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|prophet]] in your midst. Do you all<br/>
understand? You have walked by sight and without much<br/>
pleading to the Lord to know whether things were right or not.<br/>
Heretofore you have had a prophet as the mouth of the Lord to<br/>
speak to you, but he has sealed his testimony with his blood;<br/>
and now for the first time are you called to walk by faith and<br/>
not by sight.</p>

<p>The first position [[Brigham Young|I]] take in behalf of the Twelve <br/>
and the people is to ask a few questions. I ask the Latter<br/>
day Saints, do you as individuals at this time want to<br/>
choose a prophet or a guardian? Inasmuch as our Prophet <br/>
and [[Hyrum Smith|Patriarch]] are taken from our midst do you want<br/>
some one to guard to guide and lead you through this<br/>
world into the kingdom of God or not? All that want<br/>
some person to be a guardian or a Prophet a spokesman<br/>
or something else signify it by raising the right hand<br/>
-[No votes]-</p>

<p>When I came to this stand I had peculiar<br/>
feelings and impressions. The faces of this people<br/>
seemed to say we want a shepherd to guide and lead us<br/>
through this world. All who want to draw away<br/>
a party from the Church after them let them do it<br/>
if they can but they will not prosper.</p>

<p>If any man thinks he has influence among<br/>
this people to lead away a party let him try it and he<br/>
will find out that there is power with the Apostles which <br/>
will carry them off victorious through all the world and<br/>
build up and defend the Church and kingdom of God.</p>

<p>What do the people want? I feel as<br/>
though I wanted the privilege to weep and mourn for<br/>
thirty days at least, then rise up shake myself<br/>
and tell the people what the Lord wants of them</p>",
42658.0,62,,"<p>Although [[Brigham Young|my]] heart is too full of mourning to launch forth into<br/>
business transactions and the organization of the Church I feel <br/>
compelled this day to step forth in the discharge of those duties<br/>
God has placed upon me</p>

<p>I now wish to speak of the organization<br/>
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If the<br/>
Church is organized and you want to know how it is <br/>
organized I will tell you. I know your feelings. Do <br/>
you want me to tell your feelings?</p>

<p>Here is President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] who was Counselor<br/>
to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. I ask, where are Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]?<br/>
They are gone beyond the veil and if Elder Rigdon wants<br/>
to act as his Counselor he must go beyond the veil where <br/>
he is</p>

<p>There has been much said about President<br/>
Rigdon being President of the Church and leading the<br/>
people, being the head &amp;c &amp;c. Brother Rigdon has<br/>
come 1600 miles to tell you what he wants to do for<br/>
you. If the people want President Rigdon to lead them<br/>
they may have him; but I say unto you that the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve have the keys of the Kingdom<br/>
in all the world</p>

<p>The Twelve are appointed by the finger <br/>
of God. Here is Brigham; have his knees ever faltered?<br/>
Have his lips ever quivered? Here is [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] and the rest <br/>
of the Twelve an indipendant body who have the<br/>
keys of the priesthood—the keys of the kingdom of<br/>
God to deliver to all the world: this is true, so help<br/>
me God! They stand next to Joseph and are as the <br/>
First Presidency of the Church</p>

<p>I do not know whether my enemies will <br/>
take my life or not and I do not care for I want to be<br/>
with the man I love.</p>",
42658.0,63,,"<p>You cannot fill the office of a Prophet Seer and<br/>
Revelator: God must do this. You are like children without<br/>
a father and sheep without a shepherd. You must not appoint<br/>
any man at your head; if you should the Twelve must ordain<br/>
him. You cannot appoint a man at your head but if you<br/>
do want any other man or men to lead you take them and<br/>
we will go our way to build up the kingdom of God in all<br/>
the world.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] know who are [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]'s friends and who are<br/>
his enemies. I know where the keys of the kingdom are<br/>
and where they will eternally be. You cannot call a man<br/>
to be a Prophet; you cannot take Elder [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] and place <br/>
him above the Twelve; if so he must be ordained by them.</p>

<p>I tell you there is an over anxiety to hurry<br/>
matters here. You cannot take any man and put him<br/>
at the head; you would scatter the Saints to the four <br/>
winds; you would sever the Priesthood. So long as we<br/>
remain as we are the heavenly head is in constant co-operation<br/>
with us; and if you go out of that course God will have<br/>
nothing to do with you.</p>

<p>Again some perhaps think that our <br/>
beloved brother Rigdon would not be honoured, would not<br/>
be looked to as a friend; but if he does right and remains<br/>
faithful he will not act against our counsel nor we against<br/>
his but act together and we shall be as one</p>

<p>I again repeat, no man can stand<br/>
at our head except God reveals it from the heavens. I have<br/>
spared no pains to learn my lesson of the kingdom in<br/>
this world and in the eternal worlds and if it were not so<br/>
I could go and live in peace; but for the gospel and your<br/>
sakes I shall stand in my place. We are liable to be<br/>
killed all the day long. You have never lived by faith.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph the Prophet has laid</p>",
42658.0,64,,"<p>the foundation for a great work and we will build upon it: you have never<br/>
seen the quroums built one upon another. There is an almighty foundation<br/>
laid and we can build a Kingdom such as there never was in the<br/>
world: we can build a Kingdom faster that Satan can kill the<br/>
Saints off.</p>

<p>What do you want? Do you want a Patriarch for<br/>
the whole Church? To this we are perfectly willing. If brother<br/>
[[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel H Smith]] had been living it would have been his<br/>
right and privilege; but he is dead. He is gone to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and<br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]; he is out of the reach of bullets and spears and he<br/>
can waft himself with his brothers his friends and the Saints.</p>

<p>Do you want a Patriarch? Here is brother [[William B. Smith|William]]<br/>
left; here is uncle [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]], uncle to the Prophet Joseph left<br/>
It is their right. The right of the Patriarchal Priesthood belongs<br/>
to Joseph's family.</p>

<p>Do you want a Trustee in Trust? Has there<br/>
been a Bishop who has stood in his lot yet? What is his<br/>
business? To take charge of the temporal affairs so that<br/>
the Twelve and the Elders may go on the<strike>r</strike>ir business. Joseph<br/>
condescended to do their business for them. Joseph<br/>
condescended to offer himself for the Presidency of the United<br/>
States and it was a great condescension.</p>

<p>Do you want a spokesman? Here<br/>
are Elder [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] brother [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] (whom Joseph<br/>
expected to take as a counsellor) and myself. Do you want<br/>
the Church properly organized or do you want a spokesman<br/>
to be chief cook and bottle washer. Elder Rigdon claims to be<br/>
spokesman to the Prophet. Very well, he was; but can<br/>
he now act in that office? If he wants now to be a<br/>
spokesman to the Prophet he must go to the other side <br/>
of the veil for the Prophet is there but Elder Rigdon is here. Why<br/>
will Elder Rigdon be a fool? Who knows anything of the Priesthood<br/>
or of the organization of the Kingdom of God? I am plain.</p>",
42658.0,65,,"<p>Does the Church want it as God organized it? or do you want to<br/>
clip the power of the Priesthood and let those who have the Keys go<br/>
and build up the Kingdom in all the world wherever the people will<br/>
hear them?</p>

<p>If there is a spokesman, if he is King and Priest let<br/>
him go and build up a kingdom unto himself. That is his right. It<br/>
is the right of many here; but the Twelve are at the head of it.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] want to live on the earth and spread truth through<br/>
all the world. You Saints of Latter days want things right. If<br/>
ten thousand rise up and say they have the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]'s<br/>
shoes I know they are impostors. In the Priesthood you have<br/>
a right to build up a kingdom if you know how the Church<br/>
is organized.</p>

<p>Now if you want [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] or [[William Law|William Law]]<br/>
to lead you or anybody else you are welcome to them; but I<br/>
tell you in the name of the Lord that no man can put<br/>
[Figure] another between the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph. [Figure] Why?<br/>
Because Joseph was their file leader and he has committed<br/>
into their hands the keys of the kingdom in this last <br/>
dispensation for all the world. Don't put a thread<br/>
between the Priesthood of God</p>

<p>I ask who has stood next to Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]?<br/>
I have; and I will stand next to him. We have a head<br/>
and that head is the Apostleship, the spirit and power of <br/>
Joseph and we now can begin to see the necessity of that<br/>
Apostleship.</p>

<p>Brother Rigdon was at his side—not above.<br/>
No man has a right to coun<strike>i</strike>sel the Twelve but Joseph Smith<br/>
Think of these <strike>sayings</strike> ^things^. You cannot appoint a Prophet but <br/>
if you let the Twelve remain and act in their place the keys<br/>
of the kingdom are with them and they can manage the affairs<br/>
of the Church and direct all things wright</p>

<p>Now all this does not lessen the character of</p>",
42658.0,66,,"<p>President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]]. Let him magnify his calling and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] will<br/>
want him beyond the veil. Let him be careful what <br/>
he does lest that thread which bind us together be cut assunder<br/>
May God bless us all.""</p>

<p>Much more was said by President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
which I did not write. [Figure]</p>

<p>[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] said: I do not arise to electioneer. I am gratified<br/>
with the open frank and plain exposition of President Young. He has seen<br/>
the relation I bear to my deceased brother. I never did conceive it gave<br/>
me precedance to go before the Twelve.</p>

<p>I do not make any exceptions to anything he has <br/>
said. I beleive there is no power or officer or means wanted to<br/>
carry on the work but what is in the Twelve. I am satisfied that<br/>
no man can carry on the work but the power which is in the Twelve<br/>
as has been said.</p>

<p>There is one thing to secure the salvation of<br/>
this people and that is not in union alone. It is for you to know<br/>
the right and be united—it has been presented by President Young<br/>
All I design to do is to redeem my pledge.</p>

<p>President Young has stood next to the Prophet<br/>
Joseph with the Twelve and I have stood next to them and I will<br/>
stand next to them. I have been at the back of Joseph Smith and<br/>
will be at the back of the Twelve forever and then we will be<br/>
saved.</p>

<p>There is no nead of a President. We have a head<br/>
here. What is that head? The quorum of the Twelve Apostles<br/>
are that head. We now see the necessitty of the Apostleship.</p>

<p>I might rise up as well as any other man to<br/>
ask for the Presidency; but I could not do it without endangering my<br/>
salvation. This is the power that turns the key to bestow salvation<br/>
through all the land in the way that Joseph commenced it—the <br/>
first one called to do the same in all the world. If Joseph<br/>
had any power to bear off the Kingdom of God the Twelve</p>",
42658.0,67,,"<p>have the same.</p>

<p>[[Amasa Mason Lyman|I]] could not advocate the choosing a President and myself a candidate<br/>
so then you know the place I occupy is to stand to the Twelve the same as the<br/>
Twelve did to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] when on one side or the other. I do not want to go before<br/>
them or to fall asleep. I want to see the kingdom roll forth by our united<br/>
faith and efforts"".</p>

<p>President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] called upon [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] to speak in<br/>
his behalf as he could not speak himself.</p>

<p>W. W. Phelps arose and said: With the knowledge I have<br/>
I cannot but suppose that this congregation will act right this day. I believe<br/>
enough has been said to prepare the minds of the people to act.</p>

<p>I have known many of them for 14 years and I have<br/>
always known them to submit with defference to the authorities of the Church<br/>
I have seen the Elders of Israel and the people take their lives in their<br/>
hands and go without purse or scrip in winter and in summer I<br/>
have seen them prepare for war and ready to pour out their hearts blood<br/>
and that is an evidence that they will walk by coun<strike>c</strike>sel.</p>

<p>I am happy to see this little lake of faces and<br/>
to see the same disposition and spirit manifested here to day as<br/>
it was the day after the bloody tragedy when Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum<br/>
Smith]] was brought home dead to this [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]]: then you submitted to<br/>
the law's slow delay and handed the matter over to God. And<br/>
I see the same thing here to day. You are now determined as<br/>
one man to sustain the authorities of the Church and I am happy<br/>
that the men who were on Joseph's right and left hand submit<br/>
themselves to the authority of the Priesthood.</p>

<p>I have feelings about this especially for President<br/>
Rigdon and I want to say that there is a quorum that the Twelve <br/>
belong to and that the people will receive an endowment. I brought<br/>
President Rigdon into that quorum and he receved in part the blessings. I<br/>
could not bear the thought of President Rigdon going into the world<br/>
he did receive part and I hope he will submit.</p>

<p>I want Brother Amasa Lyman to stand on</p>",
42658.0,68,,"<p>the side of the Twelve and they are wanted there still. let them go<br/>
on and sustain them in that high office. You cannot put in a<br/>
guardian of the Church.</p>

<p>We have hitherto walked by sight and if any man<br/>
wanted to know anything he had only to go to brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]].<br/>
Joseph is gone but he has not left us comfortless.</p>

<p>[[William Wines Phelps|I]] want to say that brother Joseph came and<br/>
enlightened me two days after he was burried: he came to me the<br/>
same as when he was alive and in a moment appeared to me in<br/>
his own house. He said tell the drivers to drive on. I asked<br/>
^if the building was on wheels?^ He said certainly. I spoke and away it went. We drove all<br/>
round the hills and valleys. He then told the drivers to drive<br/>
on over the hill into Iowa. I told him [[Devils Creek, Iowa|Devil Creek]] was before<br/>
us. He said drive over Devil Creek; I dont care for Devil Creek<br/>
or any other creek, and we did so; then I awoke.</p>

<p>There is a combination of persons in this city who<br/>
are in continual intercourse with [[William Law|William]] and [[Wilson Law|Wilson Law]] who are<br/>
at the bottom of the matter to destroy all that stand for Joseph<br/>
and there are persons now in this city who are only wanting power<br/>
to murder all who still stand for him; but let us go ahead and<br/>
build up the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and then you will be endowed; when the<br/>
Temple is compleated all the honourable mothers in Israel will<br/>
be endowed as well as the Elders.</p>

<p>If they want to do right uphold the Twelve;<br/>
If they die I am willing to die with them: but do your duty<br/>
and you will be endowed. I will sustain the Twelve as long as I<br/>
have breath.</p>

<p>When Joseph was going away he said he was going<br/>
to die and I said I was willing to die with him; but as I am now<br/>
alive as a lawyer in Israel I am determined to live.</p>

<p>I want you all to recolect that Joseph and <br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] have only been removed from the earth and they now<br/>
counsel and converse with the Gods beyond the reach of powder</p>",
42658.0,69,,"<p>and ball.</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] remarked: What has been said has been well<br/>
said. If there are men here who are our enemies I tell you when they will<br/>
cease to be here: they will be here while you will deal with them. If I<br/>
exchange property or deal with men I do it with those whom I know to be<br/>
faithful.</p>

<p>If there are wicked men here it is because we support them<br/>
Stop dealing with them and they will go away. Will I support them?<br/>
No; I would deal with all honest men whom I know to be such.</p>

<p>I am willing to do good to all men especially<br/>
to the household of faith. Our enemies will cease to dwell here when<br/>
you cease to deal with them. Mobs and wicked men will cease<br/>
when you cease to support them. I know we can all live and<br/>
be happy too when we deal with honest men. If a man wants<br/>
a doctor or a lawyer he will send directly for the worst man he can<br/>
find. I would die a natural death sooner than I would have<br/>
a wicked doctor to help me off. I would go without sueing all<br/>
the days of my life before I would go to a lawyer to sue. I will<br/>
not say anything about the merchants because you all know them.</p>

<p>[Figure] President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] again arose and said:<br/>
""There is more business than can be done this afternoon but we can<br/>
accomplish all we want to have done without <strike>without</strike> calling<br/>
this convention of the whole Church. I am going to present to<br/>
you the leading items.</p>

<p>I do not ask you to take my counsel or advise<br/>
alone but every one of you act for yourself; but if brother [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]]<br/>
is the person you want to lead you vote for him but not<br/>
unless you intend to follow him and support him <strike>any</strike> as<br/>
you did [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. Do not say so unless you mean to<br/>
take his counsel hereafter.</p>

<p>And I would say the same for the<br/>
Twelve. Dont make a covenant to support them unless<br/>
you intend to abide by their counsel and if they do not</p>",
42658.0,70,,"<p>counsel you as you please dont turn round and oppose them.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] want every man before he enters into a<br/>
covenant to know what he is going to do; but we want to know<br/>
if this people is going to support the Priesthood. In the name<br/>
of Israel's God if you say you will, do so.</p>

<p>We want men appointed to take charge of<br/>
the business that did lay on the shoulders of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. Let<br/>
me say to you that this kingdom will spread more than ever<br/>
The Twelve have the power now the Seventies the Elders and<br/>
all of you can have power to go and build up the Kingdom<br/>
in the name of Israel's God.</p>

<p>[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] will not hold all the people who <br/>
will come into the Kingdom. We want to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]<br/>
so as to get our endowment and if we do our best and Satan<br/>
will not let us build it we will go into the wilderness and<br/>
we will receive the endowment for we will receive an<br/>
endowment anyhow.</p>

<p>Will you abide our counsel? I again<br/>
say my soul for any man's if they will abide our counsel<br/>
that they will go right into heaven. We have all the signs<br/>
and tokens to give to the porter at the door and he will let us<br/>
in.</p>

<p>I ask you as quorums do you want Bro<br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] to stand forward as your leader your guide your<br/>
spokesman. President Rigdon wants me to bring up<br/>
the other question first and that is does the Church want and<br/>
is it their ownly desire to sustain the Twelve as the First Presidency<br/>
of this people?</p>

<p>Here are the Apostles the Bible the Book of<br/>
Mormon the Doctrine and Covenants they are written on the<br/>
tablet of my heart. If the Church want the Twelve to <br/>
stand as the head—the First Presidency of the Church and at<br/>
the head of this kingdom in all the world stand next to Joseph</p>",
42658.0,71,,"<p>walk up unto their calling and hold the keys of this Kingdom every man<br/>
every woman every quorum is now put in order and you are now the<br/>
sole controllers of it.</p>

<p>All who are in favour of this in all the congregation of<br/>
the Saints manifest it by holding up the right hand.—[There was <br/>
a universal vote.]—If there are any of the contrary mind—every <br/>
man and every woman who does not want the Twelve to preside<br/>
lift up your hands in like manner.—[No hands up.] This<br/>
supersedes the other question and trying it by quorums.</p>

<p>We feel as though we could take brother<br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] in our bosom along with us. We want such men as<br/>
brother Rigdon. He has been sent away by brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] to<br/>
build up a Kingdom. Let him keep the instructions and<br/>
calling; let him raise up a mighty kingdom in [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]]<br/>
and we will lift up his hands to Almighty God. [[Brigham Young|I]] think<br/>
we may have a printing office and a gathering there. If<br/>
the devil still trys to kill us he will have enough to do.</p>

<p>The next is President [[William Marks|Marks]]. Our feeling,<br/>
is to let him stand as President of the Stake as heretofore<br/>
We can build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] &amp;c.</p>

<p>You did not know who you had amongst<br/>
you. Joseph so loved this people that he gave his life for<br/>
them. [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] loved his brother and this people unto death<br/>
Joseph and Hyrum have given their lives for the Church.<br/>
But very few knew Joseph's character. He loved you unto <br/>
death. You did not know it until after his death. He has<br/>
now sealed his testimony with his blood.</p>

<p>If the Twelve had been here we would<br/>
not have seen him given up. He should not have been given <br/>
up. He was in your midst but you did not know him<br/>
He has been taken away for the people are not worthy of<br/>
him.</p>

<p>The world is wide. [[Brigham Young|I]] can preach in [[England|England]]</p>",
42658.0,72,,"<p>[[Ireland|Ireland]] [[Scotland|Scotland]] [[France|France]] [[Germany|Germany]] &amp;c; [[Brigham Young|I]] can preach in all the world and<br/>
the devils cannot find us. I will sware to you I will not <br/>
be given up.</p>

<p>There is much to be done. You have <br/>
men among you who sleep with one eye open. The foundation<br/>
is laid by our [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] and we will build thereon. No other<br/>
foundation can be laid but that which is laid and we will<br/>
have our endowment if the Lord will.</p>

<p>As the authorities do not want us to do<br/>
military duty dont do it. If it is necessary my kneck<br/>
is ready for the knife. As for myself I am determined<br/>
to build up the Kingdom of God and by the bye there will<br/>
be a gleaning of grapes and it may be said ""to your tents<br/>
O Israel"".</p>

<p>We can build on the foundation which<br/>
was laid by the Prophet. Joseph has finished his work<br/>
and all the Devils in hell and all the mobers on earth could<br/>
not take his life until he had accomplished his work. God<br/>
said I will put a veil over his eyes and lead him up<br/>
to the slaughter like a sheep to be killed for the people<br/>
are not worthy of him though God loves this people.</p>

<p>Let no man suppose that the kingdom<br/>
is rent from you that it is not organized. If all the quorums of<br/>
the Church were slain except the High Priest they would rise up<br/>
with the keys of the Kingdom and have the power of the Priesthood<br/>
upon them and build up the Kingdom and the devil cannot<br/>
help himself.</p>

<p>You can go to a healthy country buy the land<br/>
and dont let a cursed scoundrel get in your midst. Let there be<br/>
good men good women and whenever a man comes with a wheelbarrow<br/>
full of goods dont let him land dont let him a house or buy <br/>
of him.</p>

<p>Suppose we had ten thousand such places and</p>",
42658.0,73,,"<p>increasing in greatness perfectly free from these poor devils we should feel<br/>
better than we do now. Let us all be humble and get our endowments<br/>
all be humble industrious and prudent what sort of a kingdom would it<br/>
be? The foundation is laid for more than we can think or talk<br/>
about to day.</p>

<p>Is it the will of this congregation that they will<br/>
be <strike>theth</strike>^ tithed^ until the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] is finished as they have heretofore been?<br/>
If so signify it by the uplifted hand—[<u>The vote</u> <u>was unanimous</u>]—</p>

<p>The men will act who never acted before<br/>
and they will have the power and authority to do it. Is it the<br/>
minds of the congregation to loose the hands of the Twelve and<br/>
enable us to go and preach to all the world? We want to know<br/>
the feelings of the people. Is it your will to support the Twelve<br/>
in all the world in their missions.—[<u>The</u> <u>congregation susttained</u><br/>
<u>this</u> <u>question by a unanimous vote</u>]— Will you leave it to<br/>
the Twelve to dictate about the finances of the Church and will<br/>
it be the mind of this people that the Twelve teach what will<br/>
be the duties of the Bishops in hand ling the affairs of the<br/>
Church. [[Brigham Young|I]]want this because Twelve men can do it just as<br/>
well as calling this immense congregation together at any other<br/>
time —[<u>A unanimous vote</u>]—</p>

<p>We shall have a Patriarch and the<br/>
right is in the family of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]—his brothers his sons<br/>
or some ones of his relations. Here is Uncle [[John Smith, b. 1781|John]] he has<br/>
been ordained a Patriarch. Brother Samuel would have<br/>
taken the office had he been alive. It would have been<br/>
his right. The right is in Uncle John or one of his brothers<br/>
—[<u>read Doctrine and Covenants sec III Par 17</u>]— I know that it would<br/>
have belonged to Samuel but as it is if you leave it to the<br/>
Twelve they will wait until they know who is the man<br/>
Will you leave it to the Twelve and they dictate in the<br/>
matter —[<u>unanimous vote</u>]— I know it will be let alone for the<br/>
present.</p>",
42658.0,74,1844-08-12,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] feel to bring up brother [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]]. We are of<br/>
one mind with him and he with us. Will this congregation uphold<br/>
him in the place he occupies by the prayer of faith and let him<br/>
be one with us and we with him --[<u>unanimous</u>]-- The Twelve will <br/>
dictate and see to other matters. There will be a committee<br/>
for the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and now let men stand to their posts and<br/>
be faithful"".</p>

<p>The Conference adjourned to Oct. the 6th with<br/>
the Benediction from Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]].</p>

<p>The next day I attended a council and we<br/>
appointed two Trustees in Trust for the Church--namely [[George Miller|George Miller]]<br/>
and [[Newel Kimball Whitney|N. K. Whitney]].</p>

<p>[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] at this juncture of our Church<br/>
history was seeing gloomy times. The [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Patriarch]] was<br/>
gone from us and there was but little ambition in the people<br/>
for a time to do anything though they were very busy working<br/>
on the Temple.</p>

<p>Sunday the <time datetime=""",08/18/1844
42658.0,75,,""">18</time>th a vast congregation of the Saints<br/>
assembled at the grove to hear a discourse from President Young<br/>
upon the excitement then prevailing in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] in consequence<br/>
of some trying to draw away parties after them.</p>

<p><u>Discourse</u> <u>of</u> <u>President</u> <u>Brigham</u> <u>Young</u></p>

<p>(Synopsis from my Journal)</p>

<p>I have many things to speak of. It was<br/>
my mind in the first place that we should have suitable time<br/>
to meditate upon all matters and weigh them even every subject<br/>
wherin we felt interested. When the question was asked me if</p>",
42658.0,76,,"<p>they should continue to baptize for the dead [[Brigham Young|I]] said I had no counsel to<br/>
give upon that subject at present but should think it not best to attend<br/>
to it at that time</p>

<p>I have learned some things I did not know<br/>
when I came home. I discover a disposition in the sheep to<br/>
scatter abroad now the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Shepherd]] is taken away. I do not say<br/>
that it will never be right for this people to go from here or scatter<br/>
abroad but let them wait until the time comes and until they<br/>
get counsel to do so.</p>

<p>The report has gone through the city <br/>
that the Twelve have secret understanding with those men<br/>
who are going away and taking companies with them that<br/>
they shall take all they can and that although the Twelve will<br/>
blow it up yet privately they wish it to go on but if it was<br/>
the last words I had to say before going into the eternal world<br/>
I would sware by the Holy Trinity that it is utterly false and<br/>
and not one word of truth in it. There is no man who has any<br/>
right to lead away one soul out of this city by the consent of the<br/>
Twelve except [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and [[George Miller|George Miller]] who have had<br/>
the privilege of taking the Pine Company where they pleased<br/>
but not another soul has the consent of the Twelve to go<br/>
with them.</p>

<p>There is no man who has any liberty<br/>
to lead away people into the wilderness from this Church or<br/>
to lead them anywhere else by the consent of the Twelve or the<br/>
Church except the case above named and I tell you in the<br/>
name of Jesus Christ that if Lyman Wight and George Miller<br/>
take a course contrary to our counsel and will not act in<br/>
concert with us they will be damned and go to distruction<br/>
If men will not stop striving to be great and exalted and<br/>
lead away parties from us and striving to weaken our<br/>
hands they will fall and not rise again and I will destroy<br/>
their influence in this Church with the help of God and</p>",
42658.0,77,,"<p>my brethren. [[Brigham Young|I]] wish you to distinctly understand that the counsel of<br/>
the Twelve is for every family that does not belong to the Pine Company <br/>
to stay here in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] build up the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and get their endowment.<br/>
Dont scatter. United we stand divided we fall.</p>

<p>It has been whispered about that all who go<br/>
into the wilderness with [[Lyman Wight|Wight]] and [[George Miller|Miller]] will get their endowment<br/>
but they cannot give an endowment in the wilderness. If we<br/>
do not carry out the plan laid down by [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and the pattern<br/>
he has given for us to work by we cannot get any further<br/>
endowment. I want it to sink deep into your hearts that<br/>
you may remember it. I repeat it. Let me reason with you<br/>
If you stir up the flame of dissent will you get an endowment? No.<br/>
You get a party to run here and another there and divide our strength<br/>
and weaken our hands and we shall be left and our enemies will flock<br/>
around us and destroy us. In that case you will not get your<br/>
endowment but will sink and not rise—go to hell and not to the bosom<br/>
of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]].</p>

<p>Do the people leave here because they are<br/>
affraid? Do you fear those who have power to kill the body<br/>
If you leave this place for fear of mob before God tell you to go<br/>
you will have no place of rest but you will flee from place to<br/>
place and go like the Jews until God raises up some other<br/>
people to redeem you for if the Devil scares you from this<br/>
place he will scare you from all other places.</p>

<p>Let no man go from this place but the<br/>
Pine Company brethren but stay here sow plant &amp; build. Put in your<br/>
plowshares into the praries. One plowshare will do more to<br/>
drive off the mob than two guns. Let us stay here<br/>
where the bones of Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel]] [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos]]<br/>
and Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Smith]] are. Joseph has said if I am slain<br/>
in battle or fall in any way I want my body laid in<br/>
Nauvoo. I had rather have the dead body of the Prophet<br/>
than some men who are alive and I should rather have<br/>
the clothes of the Prophet stuffed with straw for President</p>",
42658.0,78,,"<p>of the United States than any man whose name is now before<br/>
the nation for a candidate for he would not do as much harm <br/>
We want to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] in this place. If we have to build <br/>
it as the Jews built the walls of the [[Second Temple, Jerusalem|Temple]] in [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]<br/>
with a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other. How<br/>
easily some men are scared. [[Brigham Young|I]] have never been frightened<br/>
yet and I know other men who have not.</p>

<p>Do you suppose the mouth of God <br/>
is closed to be opened no more unto us. If this was so I<br/>
would not give the ashes of a rie straw for the Salvation<br/>
of the Church. If God has ceased to speak by the<br/>
Holy Ghost or revelation there is no salvation; but this is not<br/>
the case.</p>

<p>There seems to be a disposition manifested<br/>
by many to leave [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and go into the wilderness or<br/>
somewhere else. But what if we should go into the<br/>
wilderness and we should ask God to give us an<br/>
endowment and he should ask us if we were driven <br/>
from Nauvoo and who drove us. The Devil<br/>
drove us would be the answer. ""Well"" he might <br/>
say ""did you not know that I had power over the<br/>
devil"" Yes; but one said ""I would not give a Jack<br/>
knife for all Nauvoo and another said I would not<br/>
give a pair of mules for the best farm in [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]]<br/>
&amp; I was affraid.</p>

<p>Would the Lord give an endowment to <br/>
a people who was frightened away from their duty<br/>
These who are wishing to lead away parties contrary to counsel<br/>
I would not wish them damned worse than to have a company<br/>
after their own likeing for they will soon quaral among<br/>
themselves.</p>

<p>If we should go into the wilderness<br/>
and ask the Lord to give us an endowment he might ask<br/>
us saying ""Did I not give you rock in Nauvoo to</p>",
42658.0,79,,"<p>build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] with?""</p>

<p>""Yes.""</p>

<p>""Did I not through my Providence furnish men to quary<br/>
and cut the stone and prepare it for the building""</p>

<p>""Yes.""</p>

<p>""Did I not give you means to build the Temple there?</p>

<p>""Yes.""</p>

<p>""Very well, had you died in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] on the walls<br/>
of the Temple or in your fields I would have taken you to <br/>
myself and raised up men to officiate for you and you would<br/>
have enjoyed the highest glory. Did you make a<br/>
sacrifice by tithing?</p>

<p>""No""</p>

<p>""Well I dont wonder you did not believe I had power over the <br/>
devil.""</p>

<p>Such may go away. But [[Brigham Young|I]] want to have<br/>
the faithful stay here and settle this city. We shall require the<br/>
truth of all your property as the tithing for the building of the Temples<br/>
for the poor and for the Priesthood. I want my support and living by<br/>
the Church hereafter so that I can give my whole time to the<br/>
business of the Church. I have always supported myself heretofore<br/>
in all my travels and labours.</p>

<p>While in [[England|England]] in one year we circulated 60,000<br/>
tracts upon our doctrine. This ought to be done in all the world and<br/>
it can be where the Elders are faithful to their calling.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Testator has been preserved till<br/>
now but he has now sealed his testimony with his blood and his testament<br/>
should be put in force. While the Testator lived it was all in his own<br/>
hands but now he is dead.</p>

<p>There is no remission of sins without the sheding<br/>
of blood. You will soon wake up and know things as they are<br/>
There has been a great debt paid. There will be no need of more<br/>
blood of the Saints being shed at present. By and by you will</p>",
42658.0,80,,"<p>understand and see that all is right</p>

<p>Wo! Wo! Wo! unto all who have shed the blood of the <br/>
Saints and the Lord's Anointed. It must needs be that offences<br/>
come but wo unto them by whom they come.</p>

<p>To those who want to go away from this<br/>
place [[Brigham Young|I]] would say wait until the time comes. I will give you<br/>
the key. [[North America|North]] and [[South America|South America]] is Zion and as soon as<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] is done and you get your endowment you can go and <br/>
build up stakes but dont be in haste. Wait until the Lord<br/>
says, Go.</p>

<p>If you have the Spirit of God you can discern<br/>
right from wrong. When all is right in the Priesthood and a man<br/>
rises up and speaks in the Spirit of God and just right all will<br/>
say Amen; but when a man rises up and talks as smooth as <br/>
oil if he is not right there will be many queries about it. It will<br/>
not edify the body. I give this as a key.</p>

<p>You may go all over North and South America<br/>
^and build up stakes^ when the time comes. The whole continant of America must be<br/>
organized into Districts and Presiding Elders appointed over<br/>
each district. The time has come when all things must<br/>
be set in order. I have had these things upon my mind a<strike>ll</strike><br/>
long time. The time has come now for bickering to cease<br/>
There must be a strict order of things and we are no longer bound<br/>
to harbor blacklegs counterfeiters &amp; bogus makers. We know<br/>
all about them. They have been in our midst long enough. I<br/>
advise all the Saints to have no dealing with such men. Let<br/>
them alone. The time has come that they should be whiped<br/>
out of our midst. Let those men alone—let the ungodly<br/>
dealers alone. And as to the Doctors who are in our midst<br/>
who are our enemies I would say let them alone also for I have<br/>
no doubt that three to one who have died in this place had a<br/>
doctor.</p>

<p>And I would say wo unto you lawyers</p>",
42658.0,81,,"<p>for your whole study is to put down truth and put a lie in its stead. [[Brigham Young|I]] want<br/>
the lawyers to know that we have common sense. They want to make<br/>
you believe that when you spell baker you mean cider or wiskey<br/>
Now let the Doctors and Lawyers alone and leave off bitterness and<br/>
evil speaking and you will build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and get an endowment<br/>
All you lawyers go away and let us alone and when we get full of the<br/>
devil and want you we will send for you. We may then have a<br/>
more convenient season.</p>

<p>I want to say to the Saints do not harbour<br/>
blacklegs counterfeiters &amp; bogus makers. Wipe them away. It is time<br/>
to carry out the design of our Prophet. Do cease to employ doctors<br/>
lawyers and merchants who will use your purse and then mob<br/>
you. Store your grain in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] for you will want it<br/>
there to eat while you are building the Temple.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hands upon the Temple<br/>
be united and to the Committee I would say dont turn away any<br/>
person because he is an Englishman Scotchman Irishman or any other<br/>
nation but employ every man you can and build the Temple and<br/>
your homes.</p>

<p>I would rather pay out every cent to build up<br/>
this place and get an endowment even if I was driven the next minute<br/>
without anything to take with me.</p>

<p>As to the doctors let them go. I can prove<br/>
that a doctor in this place doctored a woman who was in the family way<br/>
and he did not know it until she was delivered and both the woman<br/>
and child died and if you employ them you will all die; but the<br/>
time has come when you ne<strike>e</strike>ad no longer support them.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between the law of<br/>
the land and the law of the Church. You have the privilege of<br/>
keeping all shops that does not come in contact with the law of the<br/>
the State County or City so I will evade the law says the dealer<br/>
and give away wiskey and sell a little tobaco or something else<br/>
and charge enough for both but the law of the Church will reach</p>",
42658.0,82,,"<p>such men if they are members for they will be cut off.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] had a dream which I will here relate. <br/>
I saw a fruit tree and I went into the tree to search for fruit. I<br/>
soon descovered that some of the main branches on the top growing<br/>
from the main body was dead. It seamed necessary to cut<br/>
off the dead branches in order to save the tree. So I told<br/>
some person to help me cut them off and he steped on to a large<br/>
green limb. They were affraid it would break so I put my <br/>
shoulder under it and held it up while he cut off the dead<br/>
branches. It cracked the green limb but it did not break<br/>
After we cut off the dead branches the wounds healed up and<br/>
the tree grew finely.</p>

<p>Now let us cut off the dead branches<br/>
of the Church that good fruit may grow and the voice will<br/>
soon be heard go and build Zion and the great Temple of <br/>
the Lord.</p>

<p>A word unto the Seventies. They will<br/>
be organized into their different quorums and a presidency of<br/>
of seven men will be chosen out of the first Seventy to preside<br/>
over each quorum.</p>

<p>Now as you have been warned let <br/>
every man warn his neighbour and we will give every man<br/>
his appointment as soon as convenient.</p>

<p>May the Lord bless you in the name<br/>
of Jesus Christ Amen.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the assembly was again<br/>
addressed in a simlar strain by [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and<br/>
President Young but I was at home writing and hence<br/>
did not take notes; and in the evening in company with<br/>
Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] I rode out to bro [[John Benbow|John Benbow]]s and spent the<br/>
night. We came to the conclusion to leave our only son<br/>
[[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]] with brother and Sister [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Benbow]] while I took</p>",
42658.0,83,1844-08-23,"<p>my mission to England accompanied by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]</p>

<p>Returning the next day I met in Council with the Twelve<br/>
We conversed concerning the route we should take and it was thought that<br/>
the northern route would be the healthiest. Among other things some<br/>
dreams were rehearsed. The following was told by myself:</p>

<p>""I met with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] in the congregation<br/>
of the Saints. He had his old Hebrew and German Bible and preached<br/>
to the Saints but he seamed to be too thronged by the people and he<br/>
rose up lifted up a curtain and passed into another room where the<br/>
people could not disturb him and there he was going to teach<br/>
the people.</p>

<p>The following is from the hand of [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]]:</p>

<p><u>Certificate</u> [Figure]</p>

<p>""I hereby certify that Elder Wilford Woodruff has received<br/>
a mission by order of the quorum of the Twelve to [[England|England]] to<br/>
preside over the Churches in that land and I feel to bless him<br/>

beneath his roof at this time <strike>consisting of his wife and</strike><br/>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",08/23/1844
42658.0,83,,""">23</time>rd I visited [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma Smith]] the<br/>
widow of the Prophet. She let me have a piece of oak<br/>
for a staff out of the coffin of the martyred Joseph. She<br/>
also let me have a pair of white cotton gloves and  Mrs. Woodruff a<br/>
<strike>pocket</strike> ^cotton^ handkerchief both of which were <strike>woren</strike> ^worn^ by the Prophet while<br/>
living</p>

<p>We called upon Sister [[Mary Fielding Smith|Mary Smith]] widow<br/>
of [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] the Patriarch and she gave us some hair from</p>",
42658.0,84,1844-08-23,"<p>the heads of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith]] all<br/>
brothers and the same parents. I also obtained some hair of the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-<br/>
day Saints. My intention in obtaining the hair was that<br/>
I might put a portion of each in the knob of my staff as a relick<br/>
of those noble men—the master Spirits of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>I next visited Mother [[Lucy Mack Smith|Lucy Smith]] the<br/>
parent of Joseph—the Lord's Anointed—and of Hyrum Samuel<br/>
and Don Carlos, and the wife of [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph]] the First Patriarch of<br/>
the last dispensation all of whom directly or indirectly fell martyrs<br/>
for the cause of God. The old Mother and Prophetess felt<br/>
most heart broken at the loss of her children and from the wicked<br/>
and cruel treatment she had received from the hands of the<br/>
world. She beged a blessing at my hand. I laid my<br/>
hands upon her head and by the Spirit of God proclaimed<br/>
the following</p>

<p>Beloved Mother in Israel</p>

<p>According to your request I lay<br/>
my hands upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth<br/>
and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and the keys of the kingdom<br/>
of God to bestow a blessing upon you for thou<strike>gh</strike> art worthy of<br/>
all blessings</p>

<p>As I laid my hands upon thy husband<br/>
Joseph the Senior, the Patriarch of the Church by his request<br/>
to bless him as he lay upon his bed like [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]] of old ready<br/>
to gather up his feet and sleep with his fathers and I about</p>",

we met on earth in like manner do I esteam it a blessing and privellge to<br/>
lay my hands upon [[Lucy Mack Smith|your]] head in your decline of life to leave with you<br/>
my parting blessing.</p>

<p>I am again called to bid farewell to my native<br/>
land and visit foreign climes to bear record of the word<strike>s</strike> of God. We may<br/>
never meet again on earth * but I thank my God that I have this<br/>
privilege of blessing thee for thou art the Greatest Mother in<br/>
Israel. The sons which thou hast borne and cherished are the<br/>
most noble spirits that ever graced humanity or tabernacled in the<br/>
flesh. Their work shall be had in honourable remembrance<br/>
throughout all generations. Though counted among transgressors<br/>
they like the Messiah have shed their blood for the sins of<br/>
the people and freely offered their lives and sealed their testimony<br/>
^with their blood.^</p>

<p>Thou hast lived to see the fall of thy <br/>
sons by the rage of Gentile hands but like an eternal rock in<br/>
the midst of the ocean thou has stood and God has given thee<br/>
the desire of thy heart in seeing the Keys of his Kingdom<br/>
held in the hands of thy posterity so planted on the earth<br/>
that they shall never be taken from it until He reigns whose<br/>
right it is to reign.</p>

<p>Let thy heart be comforted in the midst<br/>
of thy sorrow for thou shalt be had in honourable remembrance<br/>
forever in the congregations of the righteous. Thou shalt be<br/>
remembered in thy wants during the remainder of thy days and<br/>
when thou art called to depart thou canst lie down in peace<br/>
having seen the salvation of God in laying an everlasting<br/>
foundation for the deliverance of Israel through the instrumentality<br/>
of thy sons.</p>

<p>I seal upon your head all the blessings <br/>
of the fulness of the gospel of the ""First Born"" and all<br/>
those blessings which have been sealed upon your head<br/>
heretofore. If we meet no more on earth we shall meet</p>

<p>*We never did. Though Moth Smith lived 15 years after that</p>",

to go over the Sea to [[England|England]] to take charge of the churches<br/>
throughout that land; and we ask God the Eternal Father<br/>
in the name of Jesus Christ to bless you with health<br/>
and strength <strike>open</strike>^open^ the door before you and your family<br/>
that you may have food and rament and money and all things<br/>
necessary to make you comfortable and that the power of God may<br/>
rest upon you in a greater degree than in any mission<br/>
before. We seal upon your head these blessings. You shalt<br/>
be preserved to finish your mission and return home with your<br/>
family and meet in the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] of the Lord and rejoice therein<br/>
and shout Hosanna. You shall have power and wisdom to<br/>
accomplish the design of your missions and shall have the desire<br/>
^of your heart^ given you in all things in righteousness before God.""</p>",
42658.0,87,,"<p>The next day was Sunday and I was called upon to<br/>
address the congregation of Saints assembled in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] as I was about to leave<br/>
for my mission to [[England|England]]. The following is a few of the items I presented<br/>
to the people in my discourse.</p>

<p>""There is a Spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty<br/>
giveth it understanding. It is through this principle that this congregation is<br/>
assembled together at this place. You had understanding of the things of God<br/>
^by^<strike>and His Spirit.</strike>.  ^by the Spirit of God.^</p>

<p>I have now one important declaration to make to you<br/>
and that is that inasmuch as you will be united in heart and mind and<br/>
in action in supporting your counsellors—the Priesthood of God—the<br/>
authorities of the Church and follow the counsel given you as you<br/>
have endeavoured to follow the counsel of the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] while he was living <br/>
you will be safe and blessed and will prosper but if you are divided and<br/>
reject the counsel of God you will fall. Union and faithfulness is your<br/>
salvation. It is true you have been led by one of the best men that<br/>
ever graced humanity or tabernacled in the flesh but he is gone; he<br/>
has sealed is testimony with his blood. He loved this people unto death.</p>

<p>[Figure] I would now call upon this people to be<br/>
united in building up ^on^ the foundation which the Prophet Joseph has<br/>
laid You have been called to suffer much in the cause in which<br/>
you are engaged but if judgement begins at the house of God [[Babylon|Babylon]] will<br/>
not escape and if there is a fire in a green tree a dry tree will not<br/>
escape. There is no people ^more^ prepared for the shock that is coming<br/>
on the earth than ^the^ Latter-day Saints. The object we have is to<br/>
secure blessings beyond the veil in the first resurrection. This<br/>
is what we are preparing for.</p>

<p>Again I would say let not the Saints be<br/>
troubled because they have lost their Prophet. I would ask because<br/>
the Prophet has sealed his testimony with his blood does that destroy<br/>
the Gospel or take away the Power of God. Is truth annihalated<br/>
or has the Priesthood found a burying place? I tell you nay<br/>
His testimony is now in force. Therefore my counsel is to</p>",
42658.0,88,1844-08-27,"<p>follow the example of those who have gone before and be faithful unto<br/>
death. If you will be united and go to with your whole mights<br/>
in building that [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] you have power to accomplish it and<br/>
get an endowment"".</p>

<p>I earnestly exhorted them to faithfulness and<br/>
requested their prayers in my  behalf and asked forgiveness of any<br/>
thing which I might have done wrong and bid the congregation<br/>
farewell [Figure]</p>

<p><u>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]</u> <u>Gave</u> <u>the</u> <u>Keys</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Kingdom</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>Twelve</u></p>

<p>I was followed by President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
Also Elders [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] spoke and testified that<br/>
Joseph the Prophet had ordained anointed and appointed the Twelve<br/>
to lead the church and had given them the keys of the kingdom for<br/>
that purpose [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] and [[Reynolds Cahoon|R Cahoon]] bore testimony<br/>
that Joseph said unto the Twelve ""Upon your shoulders the<br/>
Kingdom of God must rest in all the world. Now round up<br/>
your shoulders and bear it.""</p>

<p>Many important things were spoken by the<br/>
brethren at this time which I had not the leasure to write.</p>

<p>Next day I went to the river with Mrs<br/>
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] to be baptized for some of our ^dead^ friends. I was administered<br/>
to under the hands of Elder [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]] as proxy for five of my<br/>
family. I also baptized my wife for five of her friends. [[Willard Richards|Willard<br/>

[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. As we approached we lifted up our eyes to<br/>
view the sacred scene which the silver moon illuminated<br/>
with the brightness of her glory After gazing a few</p>",

several of the police and friends followed our example among whom was General<br/>
^CC^ [[Charles Coulson Rich|CC Rich]]<strike>ard </strike>and Elder [[Benjamin Gooddard|Godard]].</p>

<p>We repared to the southwest corner of the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and there<br/>
we bowed our knees upon the top corner stone which was prepared to receive its<br/>
capitol and the<strike>ir</strike>re with uplifted hands towards heaven I called upon the God<br/>
of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] and [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]]; offering the gratitude of our hearts for preserving<br/>
our lives and giving us power to so far build the Temple; praying that it<br/>
might be finished and the Saints receive their endowments to plant the work of<br/>
God in all the earth; asking the Father for a just reckoning for the shedding<br/>
of the blood of the Lord's Anointed; praying Him to enable us to fulfil our mission<br/>
and return to the bosom of the Church; invoking a double portion of the Spirit of<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] to rest upon [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] and the Twelve to bear off the Kingdom in all the <br/>
world and for the power of the Priesthood to rest upon all the quorums and Elders<br/>
of Israel and dedicating myself family and all belonging to me in the name<br/>
of Jesus Christ unto the Lord God.</p>

<p>After prayers we descended and returned to our homes<br/>
with joy and peace in our hearts.</p>

<p>We send our beloved brother Wilford Woodruff<br/>

Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both spiritual and temporal<br/>
We wish you to give dilligent heed to his counsel in all things and as we<br/>
have not the opportunity of informing you of what has transpired this<br/>

<p>We wish the brethren to be faithful and dilligent<br/>
in keeping all the commandments of God and in hearkening to the counsels<br/>
of those who are sent to counsel them. Let no man or set of men think</p>",
42658.0,90,,"<p>they have power or authority or the keys of the Kingdom above the Apostle<br/>
Wifford Woodruff whom we send unto you to instruct you in the things<br/>
pertaining to life and salvation.</p>

<p>Though our [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] be slain for the word of God<br/>
and the testimony of Jesus yet the keys of the Kingdom remain in the<br/>
Church and the heavens are not closed neither is the mouth of the Almighty<br/>
sealed up that he cannot speak. The God of Israel will communicate to<br/>
his disciples all things necessary for the building up of his Kingdom upon<br/>
the earth until Israel is gathered: yea even all the blood of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] scattered<br/>
over all the earth Zion established [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] rebuilt and the whole earth<br/>
be filled with the glory and knowledge of God.</p>

<p>We wish all the Saints in [[England|England]] to<br/>
continue their gathering as usual to the land of America and they<br/>
may have the privilege of appointing a committee to visit the land <br/>
of America to prepare a location for a settlement of the brethren from<br/>
[[Europe|Europe]] according to their desire under the direction and counsel of Elder<br/>
Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>And further we would say unto the Saints<br/>
in all the world that may be visited by Elder Wilford Woodruff that<br/>
inasmuch as they will hearken unto his counsel they shall be blessed;<br/>
inasmuch as they shall render him any assistance in his mission<br/>
they will be doing the will of God and shall not lose their reward. And<br/>
we desire that all Saints may use their efforts to sustain him in this<br/>
important mission which he is called to fulfil by their faith prayers<br/>
and brotherly love according to the grace of God for he is quallified to<br/>
teach in all things pertaining to the Church and Kingdom of God<br/>
established in these last days.</p>

<p>Therefore dear brethren we would say unto you<br/>
in conclusion be humble and faithful and hearken dilligently unto the counsel<br/>
of this our beloved brother in the Lord Elder Wilford Woodruff and<br/>
the blessing of God will attend you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen</p>

<p>We arrived with a fair breeze at the [[Manitou Islands, Lake Michigan, Leelanau County, Michigan|Manatow<br/>

I walked over the same beach that we walked over together after being wrecked<br/>

we sailed well through the day and evening until midnight when a<br/>
strong wind arose the lake became rough and the boat rocked badly<br/>
and in the midst of it when we we were opposite the Cleveland lighthouse<br/>
a cry of <u>Fire</u> <u>Fire</u> <u>Fire</u> rang through the boat by the watch on deck<br/>
We immediately leaped from our births in our night clothes and each<br/>
one caught a bucket as best he could and I caught a bucket about half<br/>
full of water and ran barefoot as I was to the stern of the boat looking<br/>
for the fire while some was running up stairs. I leaped into the engine<br/>
room and saw the fire in one corner of the stern of the boat. I ran over the<br/>
pile of coal and dashed my water into the fire which was not larger than<br/>
a half bushel measure at the same time a bucket of water flung by Capt<br/>
Davis struck the fire and it was extinguished.</p>

<p>There is nothing more terrible and alarming than the<br/>
cry of fire at sea or on any water out of the reach of land. It is far more</p>",
42658.0,92,1844-09-19,"<p>terrible than a storm or wreck for when fire gets the control all hope is lost<br/>
and persons will plunge into the raging deep to escape its fury. On my<br/>
return to the cabin I found one woman in convulsions with alarm and Mrs<br/>
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] holding her and she did not get over it until the next day.</p>

[[Lake Erie, United States|Lake Erie]] entered the mouth of [[Welland Canal, Canada West, British North America|Welland Canal]] to go round the Falls into <br/>

arose at midnight and during the next day we had a very rough<br/>

<p>Journying on by boat and rail I arrived<br/>
at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]'s house at [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] on the <time datetime=""",09/30/1844

children left me on the road several days before to visit her parents<br/>

<p>I had quite an interesting time in visiting<br/>
my family and friends in Farmington and neighbouring places<br/>
and during my stay there I ordained my uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]]<br/>
unto the office of High Priest.</p>

arrived in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] two days later. Here I found the eastern churches<br/>
were passing through a critical state and I wrote to President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
giving him an account thereof. Elder [[George Washington Joshua Adams|G. J. Adams]] at this time was <br/>
holding discussion with [[Origen Bachellon|O Bachellon]] at the Ma<strike>l</strike>rlbury Chapell. It<br/>
was a money getting scheme.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",10/12/1844

and plainness to the Church in Boston against iniquity in all its forms<br/>
informing the<strike>m</strike> Saints that any man from the head to the foot would<br/>
be brought to justice if he broke the commandments of God and advised<br/>
all to be cautious and for none to throw themselves to ruin because<br/>
others do wrong.</p>

<p>I had a convers[at]ion with Bro Whitmore<br/>
and he related to me the following dream.</p>",
42658.0,93,1844-10-21,"<p>He had prayed to God to let him see [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] in a dream and he<br/>
fell asleep and dreamt that he saw the heavens opened and beheld some of<br/>
the things of eternity. He saw a personage rise out of the earth and<br/>
an Elder informed him that it was Joseph Smith. Joseph did not speak<br/>
to him but droped some slips of paper on the ground from whence<br/>
he arose. Brother Whitmore picked up one of them and read upon<br/>
it the words— ""[[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma]] is not worthy of me."" He wished<br/>
to read the others but the person with him picked them up and put <br/>
them in his pocket and did not let him read them.</p>

<p>After my meeting that evening Elder [[George Washington Joshua Adams|Adams]]<br/>
and [[Samuel S. Brannan|Brannan]] prefered a charge against Elder [[John Hardy|Hardy]] for slander<br/>
and the case was to be tried on the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>On the Sunday I met a large congregation,<br/>
Sister [[Mary Polly Vose|Vose]] that day gave me 10 dollars and another sister five to<br/>
help me on my mission and in the afternoon's meeting a collection<br/>
was taken up for the same object making in all about 50 dollars<br/>
with the $15 given me at Sister Vose's. At night I attended another<br/>
discussion between Adams &amp; [[Origen Bachellon|Bachellon]].</p>

<p>I visited [[Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Lowel]] where <strike>there</strike> I found Elder<br/>
[[William Smith|William Smith]]; and the Branch at that place was in a sad<br/>
condition of disatisfaction and in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on that evening the trial<br/>
was to come off against Elder John Hardy to try to cut him off for<br/>
slandering Adams Brannan and William Smith.</p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Peculiar</u> <u>Dream</u> [FIGURE]</p>

<p>While at my father-in-laws I dreamt a peculiar<br/>
dream. Much of it was unutterable and cannot be written. Indeed<br/>
I cannot comprehend it myself. Among other things I thought<br/>
I was called to hold with the Twelve the Keys of the Kingdom in all<br/>
the world and I travelled with them over much of the earth<br/>
and finally travelled through many countries alone and when<br/>
I got through I saw many things which I cannot write and<br/>
in the end [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the Prophet assissted me to come into<br/>
the place where he was and pointed out my work <strike>and</strike> portion<br/>
^and^ <strike>of</strike> labour. I immediately entered into the duties<br/>
assigned me.</p>

<p>I also had on the same night another<br/>
dream. I was in the presence of the Prophet Joseph</p>",
42658.0,95,1844-11-24,"<p>and was conversing with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|him]] about his death. I told him I felt bad about<br/>
it and that had I known he would have been taken away so soon I should<br/>
have conversed more with him while living and asked him more questions<br/>
He said it was not his fault I did not. Speaking of my work and duties<br/>
he said I had better get a dozen to help me.</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>I stoped at [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on my way and met with the<br/>
Church and cut off eight from the Church who had joined [[Sidney Rigdon|Sydney Rigdon]]'s<br/>
faction. This left the Boston Church firm.</p>

<p>On the Sunday <time datetime=""",11/24/1844

city which for beauty and elegance and location is hardly to be<br/>
surpassed. It is <strike>a</strike> ^the most^ noted city for fitting out <strike>of</strike> walemen.<br/>
The whole city has been built up through the wale trade. The<br/>
docks were lined with casks of wale and sperm oil. We went<br/>
aboard of a number of wale ships which were fitting out which<br/>
would carry from fifteen hundred to three thousand barrels of<br/>
oil. A sister gave me three pair of specimen of shels brought<br/>
from the wale country.</p>

<p>I arrived in New York on the<br/>

mill which he had rented and occupied all his lifetime to old<br/>
age and after he had spent the last summer in repairing the mills<br/>

on he turned him off without notice.</p>

that [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] had gone to [[New York|New York]] to take charge of<br/>

as I entered the meeting Elder [[Thomas Ward|Ward]] spoke to me and wished<br/>
me to go with him to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and attend evening meeting<br/>
as there had been an appointment for an American Elder<br/>
to preach. Accordingly we took the rail and arrived<br/>
just as the meeting commenced. Elder Ward introduced<br/>
me and I addressed the meeting 1 hour and twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Here I again met Elders [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]]<br/>
[[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and [[Charles Miller|Charles Miller]] with whom I pleasantly<br/>
spent the Monday and returned on the following day to Liverpool.</p>

<p>In the 9th No of the Millennial Star<br/>

<p>About the middle of February I received<br/>
letters from Elder John Taylor from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and from <br/>
P P Pratt who was presiding over the eastern Churches in </p>",

<p>Special Conference<br/>
held in<br/>
[[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] Sunday <time datetime=""",02/16/1845
42658.0,101,,""">Feb 16. 1845</time>.</p>

<p>There were present Wilford Woodruff President of the Mission<br/>
his Counsellors Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and [[Thomas Ward|Ward]] with five High Priests<br/>
30 Elders 31 Priests 21 Teachers and 4 deacons.</p>

<p>We met with the officers before the public<br/>
meeting and laid before them the buisness of the day and then<br/>
a vast assembly of the Saints gathered in Conference capacity<br/>
and we laid before them the changes designed for the Manchester<br/>
Conference and it was proposed that Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] preside<br/>
over the Conference and Elder [[James Darling Ross|J. D. Ross]] over the Manchester<br/>
branch both of whom accepted their appointment. Sacrament<br/>
was then administered which occupied the time till dark.</p>

<p>In the evening we had another mamoth<br/>
meeting. Elder Hedlock first addressed the assembly and<br/>
then he and Elder Ward had to leave for ^[[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]^ <br/>
but could scarcely get out of the crowded Hall. I then arose and <br/>
addressed the congregation and the Spirit of the Lord was with<br/>
us and love and union pervaded the congregation.</p>

<p>It was a scene to make the heart <br/>
glad to behold together in a foreign mission so many Saints.</p>",
42658.0,102,,"<p>united together in the Everlasting Covenant. I had often thought how<br/>
much I should like to see the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] meet with a <br/>
Conference of Saints in [[England|England]] but it was not granted<br/>
to the British nation to have the Prophet in their midst nor<br/>
to him nor us to see him meet in England the thousands who<br/>
had entered into the New Covenant which God through his mission<br/>
had mad unto Israel.</p>

<p>This was one of the most interesting<br/>
Conference I ever attended abroad and this day was fullfilled<br/>
a prophecy which I gave in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|House of the Lord]] in Kirtland<br/>
in 1837 that I should attend a Conference with Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]<br/>
in the [[British Isles|British Isles]].</p>

<p>On the 3rd day after our conference I<br/>
took the railway cars from [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] to [[Bradford, Yorkshire, England|Bradford]] where I<br/>
arrived at noon and in the afternoon, [[Elijah Funk Sheets|Elijah F Sheets]] arrived<br/>
from [[Leeds, Yorkshire, England|Leeds]]. He had come over from America with<br/>
Elders [[Joseph Albert Stratton|Stratten]] and [[Elisha Hildebrand Davis|Davis]]. We were truly glad to meet<br/>
each other on a foreign shore and to attend meetings together<br/>
in the evening with the Saints of that place. Brother<br/>
Sheets was presiding over the Bradford Conference.</p>

<p>The next day in company with<br/>
Elders Sheets and [[James Ure|Ure]] presidents of the Bradford and Sheffield<br/>
Conferences I <strike>left</strike> ^walked^ to [[Idle, Yorkshire, England|Idle]] in [[Yorkshire, England|Yorkeshire]] three miles from Bradford<br/>
to pay</p>

<p>A Visit to the Grave of [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Lorenzo Barnes]]</p>

<p>When we arrived about halfway we had a fair view<br/>
of Idle and the Churchyard where for a season was laid<br/>
the remains of our beloved brother until the brethren of the<br/>
household of faith to which he belonged removed the dust of<br/>
the honoured dead to his native land and laid it in the<br/>
burial place of the Saints.</p>",
42658.0,103,,"<p>We had a beautiful green vale to pass through before <br/>
arriving at [[Idle, Yorkshire, England|Idle]] which is on the top of a hill. The fields of grass<br/>
were as green as in May though it was but February which gave<br/>
the landscape around us a picturesque and verdant charm. We<br/>
were walking on the road which our departed brother had walked over<br/>
many scores of times to preach the gospel of Jesus and I felt<br/>
sorrowful and filled with meditation.</p>

<p>Arriving at Idle containing a population of <br/>
seven thousand inhabitants and a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ <br/>
of Latter-Day Saints numbering 37 members we called upon <br/>
Elder [[Thomas Cordingly|Thomas Cordingly]] and family who had the care of Elder<br/>
[[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Barnes]] through his sickness and death. They pointed out<br/>
to me the house and room where he passed ^t^h<strike>is</strike>^e^ last hours of <br/>
his mortal life.</p>

<p>After partaking of some refreshments we<br/>
walked to the Churchyard and reverently gazed upon the peaceful silent<br/>
grave of our beloved brother. My feelings were sensitive and <br/>
sad. As I stood upon his grave I realised that I was standing<br/>
over the body of one of the Elders of Israel of the ""horns of Joseph,""<br/>
one of the members of "" Zion's Camp"" who travelled more than <br/>
one thousand miles in 1834 for the redemption of his proseuted<br/>
and afflicted brethren ready to lay down his life for their sakes<br/>
and whose fidelity was a strong trait of character.</p>

<p>While standing upon his grave I offered<br/>
up my vocal prayer to Israel's God that I might die the death<br/>
of the righteous when called away and that my last end might<br/>
be as safe as our beloved and departed brother's and that his sacred<br/>
dust might be called forth in the morn of the First Resurrection.</p>",
42658.0,104,,"<p>Meditating upon his life I retired from the grave of Elder [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Barnes]] in company<br/>
with my brethren who had come with me to pay our reverant respect<br/>
and remembrance of our departed brother and on our return to the<br/>
family who attended him in his last moments I made enquiries<br/>
and obtained the following information.</p>

<p><u>The Cause of Sickness &amp; Death of Lorenzo Barnes</u></p>

<p>On^e^ day in the latter part of September ^1843^<br/>
Elder Barnes walked very fast for about thirteen miles to<br/>
reach the railway station in time to take the cars. Some<br/>
part of the way he ran and got into a high state of perspiration<br/>
and only had time step into the train just as it was starting<br/>
He rode on the railroad for about twenty miles during which<br/>
time he became entirely dulled which <strike>thro</strike> ^gave^ him a severe cold<br/>
that setted upon his lungs and brought on quick consumption<br/>
from which he never recovered. He attended conference and preached<br/>
several times afterwards but was very feble. The last time<br/>
he preached was from the passage—""There remaineth therefore<br/>
a rest for the people of God"". After he was confined to his<br/>
bed he was asked if he would have a Physician but answered<br/>
""No."" If he died he would die a natural death. If he lived<br/>
he should live unto the Lord if he died he should die unto the<br/>
Lord. He manifested a great desire to live if it should be<br/>
the will of God that he might return to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. He was<br/>
deprived of his reason during some portion of the time and his<br/>
whole conversation on such intervals would he about Nauvoo<br/>
how he should yet there and his friends. He spoke of his<br/>
mother frequently. The night before his death he had his<br/>
reason and he then bore a strong and faithful testimony of the<br/>
truth of the fulness of the Gospel as taught by the Latterday Saints</p>",
42658.0,105,,"<p>I also learned that Elder [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Barnes]] suffered by going with<br/>
poor boots and wet feet from place to place. He was slow to make his<br/>
wants known to the brethren and some were slow to administer to them<br/>
until he got sick. Every attention however was paid to him after he<br/>
was confined to his bed but then it was too late.</p>

<p>I enquired if there were any writings left by <br/>
him such as Journals &amp;c but could find nothing excepting several<br/>
fragments of a correspondence in poetry between himself and his intended<br/>
wife which showed the strong fidelity of his heart so characteristic<br/>
of the man throughout every action of his life. These fragments I<br/>
copied from his M. S. into my daily Journal.</p>

<p>I preached to a good congregation at [[Idle, Yorkshire, England|Idle]] that evening<br/>
and the next day in company with Elders [[Elijah Funk Sheets|Sheets]] and [[James Ure|Ure]] and [[Abraham Lord|Abraham<br/>
Lord]] the presiding Elder of the Idle Branch I returned to [[Bradford, Yorkshire, England|Bradford]].</p>

<p>The brethren placarded the town with the following<br/>
notice:</p>

<p>The meeting being duly opened the Conference<br/>
was represented consisting of three Branches—Bradford Leeds<br/>
and Idle numbering in the whole 168 members.</p>

<p>There was a good number of the Saints<br/>
gathered together and an excellent band of music in front of the<br/>
pulpit accompanied the singers. In the morning Elder Woodruff<br/>
addressed the meeting.</p>

<p>The chapel in the afternoon was crowded<br/>
with the Saints and citizens. Sacrament was administered<br/>
and I again addressed the congregation but was somewhat interupted<br/>
by a man intoxicated who had been cut off the Church.</p>

<p>In the evening we again had a crowded<br/>
house and the music and singing which commenced our service<br/>
was inspiring. It fell to my lot once more to address the<br/>
congregation during the evening and I took for my text the<br/>
XIV of Rev 6 7 &amp; <strike>8</strike> verses. In my discourse I gave an account of<br/>
the rise and progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day<br/>
Saints the leading mind of Joseph Smith how he was called of God<br/>
by the administration of angels and traced the subject through to<br/>
the sealing of his testimony with his blood.</p>

<p>I spoke for the space of one hour with<br/>
the power of God and the congregation as still as death and<br/>
a most intense interest prevailed. During the Conference</p>",
42658.0,107,1845-03-01,"<p>I confirmed 4 persons blessed 3 children and laid hands upon twelve persons for <br/>
the healing of their infirmat<strike>a</strike>ies.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards I returned to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] stoping<br/>
on the way several hours at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] which I spent with [[Milton Holmes|Elder Holmes]].</p>

<p><u>An Attempt to Rob the Church of the Copyright of<br/>
The Book of Doctrine and Covenants</u> +</p>

<p>On my birthday I received a letter from a friend<br/>
containing the copy of a letter dated [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] Jan 30, 1845 written by<br/>
[[John Greenhow|John Greenhow]] to his father in [[Kendal, Westmorland, England|Kendal]] stating that he was getting the<br/>
Doctrine and Covenants stereotyped in Pittsburg and that he was going to<br/>
bring the plates to [[England|England]] to print the work here and get the copyright secured<br/>
so that the Church could not print <strike>them</strike> ^it^</p>

<p>This was indeed a bold move of the apostates to<br/>
<strike>undertake to</strike> undertake to print the works of the Church and such a<br/>
book as the Doctrine and Covenants which is the second standard work of the<br/>
<strike>Church</strike> and I viewed it as nothing less than the providence of God<br/>
which ^put^ the knowledge of this design to rob the Church of the copyright<br/>
into my hand^s^. I spent the day in examining the law of <br/>
England upon the securing of copyright. +</p>

<p>I spent the forepart of the following day at<br/>
home and the afternoon with Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and [[Thomas Ward|Ward]] upon whom at this<br/>
time I laid my hands and ordained as my counsellors <strike>and they then<br/>
laid their hands upon me and blessed me</strike>. Afterwards <strike>we partook</strike><br/>
<strike>of the sacrament together and then</strike> we called upon God our Father to<br/>
bless us and frustrate the designs of our enemies and overthrow the<br/>
<strike>designs</strike> ^plans^ which they had laid to rob the Church and injure the cause</p>",
42658.0,108,1845-03-09,"<p>of God.</p>

<p>I wrote President [[Brigham Young|Young]] giving him account of the<br/>
affairs of the mission and informed him of the deep laid scheme<br/>
of those at [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]], America—[[John Greenhow|John Greenhow]] [[Samuel Bennett|Samuel Benett]]<br/>
and others to rob the Church of the copyright of the Book of<br/>
Doctrine and Covenants. I also wrote to the Secretary at<br/>
Stationers Hall to secure the Copyright of the work myself for<br/>
the Church and wrote to brother [[Harry Cuerden|Cureden]] to send me a copy <br/>
of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>

<p>[[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] Quarterly Conference was held <br/>
on Sunday the <time datetime=""",03/09/1845
42658.0,108,,""">9th of March</time> at which myself and Elder [[Thomas Ward|Ward]]<br/>
attended. Elder [[John Banks|John Banks]] was called to the chair. During<br/>
the day Elder [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]] was chosen to preside over the<br/>
Conference and there were eleven Branches represented with 505<br/>
members.</p>

<p>Next day I took a walk through the city and<br/>
visited the old Cockpit where Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] had<br/>
preached so much at the first opening of the British mission and<br/>
where also Dr [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] afterwards <strike>also</strike> preached.</p>

<p>We walked up and down the river where<br/>
many hundred of the Saints had been baptized and I also viewed<br/>
^from where^ the Scotch made an attack upon the English at Preston when the <br/>
<strike>gallant enthusiastic</strike> <strike>followers</strike> ^army^ of the Young Pretender made ^their^ illfated<br/>
<strike>and mad</strike> attempt  to unseat the first George from the English<br/>
<strike>throne and</strike> ^Washed it the house of the Stuarts^ <strike>give it to their bonnie Charle</strike>. Some of the Scotch<br/>
entered the town as far as the Cockpit but most of them was<br/>
slain in the Valley. I saw their burial place. There is now a <br/>
grove growing over their bodies. This was in the year 1745<br/>
just one hundred years before this date.</p>

<p>We returned to the town and after dinner<br/>
I took the parting hard of Elders Banks and Hardy and the<br/>
Saints of Preston and returned to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]</p>",

<p>In company with my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and Sisters Clark and [[Mary Baylis Haywood Pugmire|Haywood]]<br/>
I visited Nelson's Monument the design of which was made by [[Mathew Charles Wyatt|Mathew<br/>
Charles Wyatt]] of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and was executed in bronze by [[Richard Westmacott|Richard<br/>
Westmacott]] also of London and the pedestal of Hendal Marble by<br/>
Messrs Hetherington and Webster of Liverpool. The subscription<br/>
to build it commenced on the 15^th^ of Nov 1805 and ^was^ completed the same<br/>
year amounting to £9000 and the first stone was laid July 15th 1812.</p>

<p>The principal figure is Admiral Nelson<br/>
resting one foot on a conqured enemy and the other on a cannon his eye<br/>
stedfast and upraised to Victory from whom he is receiving a fourth<br/>
naval crown upon his swourd held in his left hand indicating the loss of<br/>
his right which is concealed by the flag which the genius of Victory<br/>
is lowering over him. Under the folds of this flag Death lies<br/>
in ambush indicating that he received the reward of Victory and the <br/>
stroke of Death at the same time. There is an enraged British<br/>
sailor represented symbolizing the zeal of the navy to revenge the loss of its<br/>
most illustrious chief and in the back ground is Britannia leaning on<br/>
her sphere and shield with lau<strike>a</strike>rral in her hand but she ^is^ regardless of them<br/>
representing the country's pride and anguish over the triumph so darly<br/>
purchased.</p>

<p>Around the upper moulding of the pedestal are<br/>
inscribed Nelson's ever memorable words—""[[England|England]] expects every man<br/>
to do his duty"". At the base of the pedestal are four figures in<br/>
chains as captives emblematical of the four great victories he achieved and<br/>
the space between these figures on the sides of the pedestal is filled by four<br/>
grand <u>bass reliefs</u> executed in bronze ^also^ representing those glorious<br/>
victories—namely, St Vincent 14 Feb. 1797; Nile 1st Aug. 1798;<br/>
[[Copenhagen City, Denmark|Copenhagen]] 2nd of April 1801; Trafalgar 21st of Oct. 1805. The<br/>

<strike>Peter M<sup>c</sup>Cue was called to the chair and</strike> <strike>a</strike>After singing and<br/>
prayer 15 Branches of the Church w<strike>as</strike>ere represented containing<br/>
1065 members 35 Elders 51 Priests 37 Teachers 24 Deacons.<br/>
<strike>[[William Gibson|Wm Gibson]] was clerk of the Conference.</strike></p>

<p>During the day the vast assembly</p>",
42658.0,111,,"<p>of the Saints was addressed by Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] [[Thomas Ward|Ward]] [[John Banks|Banks]] and myself. I<br/>
felt much interested in this my first visit and Conference among the Scotish Saints</p>

<p>Next day I <strike>called</strike> ^took the^ rail to [[Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, Scotland|Coats Bridge]] and thence went<br/>
to [[Whifflet, Lanarkshire, Scotland|Whifflett]] and held a Council with the officers of that Branch and the following<br/>
morning I took a walk to visit Dunbyvan Iron Works. From thence we <strike>visited</strike> ^walked^<br/>
^to Ashley and called upon the brethren there and then visited^ the extensive Calder Banks Mallable Iron Works</p>

<p>I next visited the <u>Ardrie</u> <u>Museum</u><br/>
collected and kept by Mr [[James Myrdock|James Myrdock]] antiquarian. After taking<br/>
some refreshments with him he showed us each appartment of the Museum<br/>
and among the many curiosities I had a view of coins from about 1000<br/>
years before Christ down to the present day. Among the rest were<br/>
coins bearing the names and profile of <u>Pallios</u> 1000 B.C. Antonius,<br/>
Vespersion Caesar, Servius, Christianna, Comodus, Posthumus,<br/>
Artaxus, Tragin, Domician, Antonius, Gordian, Auridian, Hiradien,<br/>
Claudius Caesar, and Pius.</p>

<p>There was quite a collection of natural History<br/>
and three and half tons of precious books as a liberary. I saw<br/>
also a ^metal pot^ bearing this inscription: ""One Hundred and <br/>
twenty years after Christ. I belong to St. Lawrence."" I also saw<br/>
three gold and silver Roman crosses stolen by travellers from the <br/>
Vatican at Rome, 300 years old, besides a number of weapons of war<br/>
and paintings of ancient date.</p>

<p>Afterwards we called at a brothers house and I<br/>
laid hands upon six who were sick <strike>and blessed twenty persons who pled<br/>
with me to let them have a blessing under the hands of an Apostle.</strike>  I <br/>
preached in the evening to a crowded house and afterwards walked to <br/>
brother [[Mathew Carruthers|Carruthers]] and spent the night.</p>

<p><strike>I dreamt a rattlesnake bit me on the ancle but I<br/>
pulled him off squezed him to death and much poison ran out of<br/>
him. The interpretation was that when we arrived at [[Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland|Edinborough]]<br/>
I should be opposed by          for appointing<br/>
[[John Banks|John Banks]] to preside over that Branch and Conference of the<br/>
Church</strike>.</p>",
42658.0,112,,"<p>Returning to [[Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland|Glasgow]] and joining Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and<br/>
[[Thomas Ward|Ward]] we took the rail to [[Castlecary, Lanarkshire, Scotland|Castle Car<strike>e</strike>ry]] and thence by coach to [[Stirling, Stirlingshire, Scotland|Sterling]]<br/>
and as we came in sight of it among the mountains we had a fine<br/>
view of the famed Sterling Castle which brought to mind the heroic<br/>
Wallace &amp; the royal Bruce in their renowned wars to free [[Scotland|Scotland]] from<br/>
the English yoke. Sterling Castle was taken by Wallace in<br/>
one of his most famous acts</p>

<p>Arriving at Sterling we called upon<br/>
Elder [[Daniel H. Sutherland|Daniel Sutherland]] in John Street and took supper and<br/>
then called upon [[John Gillies|John Gillies]] 76 years of age. He was the third<br/>
man in the formation of the 92 Handers was in the army for<br/>
21 years and embraced the Gospel in the 73 year of his age<br/>
I had an interesting conversation with him during the evening<br/>
and we spent the night at his house</p>

<p><u>Sterling</u> <u>Castle</u>. Next morning with brothers Hedlock Ward<br/>
and Gillies we visited Sterling castle and went through every appartment<br/>
of it. As we passed up the avenue leading to the castle<br/>
we closely examined the palace of [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary Queen of Scots]] and the King's<br/>
stables and went into them!</p>

<p>In going through the old castle we saw<br/>
the armoury and old flags and many things of antiquity We <br/>
went into into the Chaple of John Knox and closely examined the oak<br/>
pulpit in which he preached and where he baptized Prince Henry<br/>
I brought away a small piece of the pulpit and stood upon the<br/>
exa<strike>t</strike>ct spot where the fierce Scotish reformer Knox stood and <br/>
preached his first sermon. Here I also saw the place in<br/>
the old church where stood the Twelve Apostles in stone figures<br/>
which Knox destroyed before commencing his sermon and fierce<br/>
denunciation against popery and image worship. We also had<br/>
a view of the habitation of the Earl of Lecester in 16^39^ and<br/>
Cemens Hospital and the place where James the VI was crowned<br/>
We had a pleasant view of Sterling Castle and the surrounding <br/>
country from its heights</p>",
42658.0,113,,"<p>While at Sterling I laid my hands upon the veteran [[John Gillies|John<br/>
Gillies]] and blessed him and ordained him an Elder and on the third day<br/>
from our arrival we took steamboat for [[Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland|Edinborough]] where we arrived at<br/>
seven oclock and after taking some refreshments at [[Henry McEwan|Henry McEwan]]'s the<br/>
Presiding Elder we went to the meeting</p>

<p>This was the first time I had ever been in Edinborough<br/>
and the Edinborough Conference of the Church was in a divided state for<br/>
many aspiring spirits were there and had been manifested for a length<br/>
of time. I prayed God to give us wisdom to set this Conference<br/>
in order.</p>

<p><u>Edinborough</u> <u>Castle.</u><br/>
Next day we viewed the renowned city of Edinborough<br/>
and visited its castle and went through each appartment of it. From the<br/>
Castle we had a splendid view of the city <strike>of Edinborugh</strike> and surrounding<br/>
country for many miles. The rock itself which forms the site of<br/>
the castle is three hundred and eighty ^3^ feet above the level of the sea and<br/>
is accessable only on the eastern side the other sides being nearly perpendicular</p>

<p>The castle is of great antiquity and has been held<br/>
as a fortress from the earliest times. In 1093 it was besieged by Donald<br/>
^Bane^ brother to King Malcolm; taken by the English in 1296, retaken and<br/>
demolished by Randolph 1313, rebuilt by Edward the III of England,<br/>
surprised by Wm. Douglas 1341, and by Albany in 1482; taken<br/>
by the Regent Murray from Mary Queen of Scots, his half sister, in 1573;<br/>
by Cromwell in 1650 and by William the III of England in 1689</p>

<p>The Scotish Regalia are kept in the castle.<br/>
They were placed there in 1707 and discovered in an o[a]ken chest in the <br/>
crown room in 1818. This is King David's crown, first King of <br/>
[[Scotland|Scotland]]</p>

<p>I also inspected the celebrated piece of artilary<br/>
called Mons Meg cast at Mons in Flanders. It was used in the<br/>
seige of Norham and afterwards burst in firing a salute to the Duke<br/>
of York on his visit to the castle in 1682. It was forged in<br/>
1486 out of large bars of iron. Its weight was seven and half tons<br/>
and it carried 268 pound shot, the bore was twenty inches and </p>",
42658.0,114,,"<p>its length fifteen feet.</p>

<p>After visiting the Armoury and going through<br/>
each appartment of the castle and taking the splendid views of <br/>
the surrounding country we left and visited other portions of the<br/>
city and among the rest saw <u>The</u> <u>old</u> <u>house</u> <u>where</u> <u>John</u><br/>
<u>Knox</u> <u>the</u> <u>Scotish</u> <u>Reformer</u> <u>was</u> <u>born</u> <u>May</u> <u>2nd</u> <u>1505</u> <u>and</u><br/>
<u>died Nov</u> <u>24, 1572</u>.</p>

<p><u>Visit to the Palace of Holyrood</u></p>

<p>We next visited the Palace of Holyrood. It occupies the<br/>
site of an Abbey which was founded by David the I. in 1128<br/>
and which was one of the ^richest religious establishments in [[Scotland|Scotland]].^</p>

<p>^In the^ chapel ^of the palace^ were deposited the remains of David II; James II; Prince<br/>
Arthur third son of James IV; James V; Magdalene his queen;<br/>
Arthur Second son of James V, and Henry Darnley. The<br/>
ruins of what is now called the Chapel Royal ^is worthy of notice.^</p>

<p>The <u>Picture</u> <u>Gallery</u> of Holyrood which<br/>
is 156 feet long by 27 1/2 wide and 20 feet in height contains<br/>
the portriats of the Scotish monarchs.</p>

<p>In the palace are preserved several relics<br/>
of the unfortunate Queen Mary of Scotts. I saw her workbox<br/>
visited her bedchamber and saw the bed and furniture and the<br/>
chair occupied by her when married and also visited her dressing<br/>
room both of which was hung with the most splendid ancient tapestry.</p>

<p>I saw the hiding palace of Lord Darnley<br/>
and his associates when they murdered David Rizzio Mary's musician<br/>
and the place where the victim fell and the stain of his blood<br/>
which yet remains. I also saw the armour worn by Lord <br/>
Darnley at the time of the murder and I put on Darnley's steal<br/>
head dress which was heavy</p>",
42658.0,115,1845-03-23,"<p>We visited each appartment of this palace of Kings one of<br/>
which was the state room of George the IV, where was his throne and portrait<br/>
in his Highland dress by David Wilkey and among the curiosities of this<br/>
chief dwelling place of [[Scotland|Scotland]]'s royality I saw the bones of the Kings in<br/>
the vault pilled up together. [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] took away their coffins and left<br/>
their bones scattered upon the ground. Here was the end of human<br/>
greatness symbolized in a nations royal burrial place in the palace of<br/>
its kings.</p>

<p>We called upon one of the brethren after out visit to<br/>
Holyrood and having taken dinner started out again to view other<br/>
portions of the city. <u>Sir</u> <u>[[Walter Scott|Walter Scott]]s Monument is</u> a splendid<br/>
speciment of art.</p>

<p>On the following day we held conference in<br/>
the city</p>

<p><u>The Edinborough Conference</u><br/>
of the<br/>
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<br/>
Sunday <time datetime=""",03/23/1845

<p>Present: One of the Twelve Apostles 3 High Priests 8 Elders 16 Priests<br/>
and four Teachers. [[Reuben Hedlock|R. Hedlock]] was chosen President and Priest<br/>
[[Jesse Charles Braley|Braley]] Clerk</p>

<p>Conference having been opened with singing and prayer<br/>
eleven Branches were represented as the Edinborough Conference containing<br/>
409 members 13 Edlers 22 Priests 8 Teachers 1 Deacon and 9<br/>
baptized since the last Conference.</p>

<p>The morning was taken up in teaching principle<br/>
in the afternoon the Church partook of the Sacrament after which Elder [[John Banks|John<br/>
Banks]] was appointed President of the Edinborough Conference and also the<br/>
Edinborough Branch and [[Henry McEwan|Henry McEwen]] presiding Elder over two or three<br/>
Branches under Elder John Banks. In the evening I preached</p>",
42658.0,116,,"<p>to an attentive congregation.</p>

<p>A company of young men who called themselves<br/>
the Nauvoo Legion escorted us out to see the city next morning and they<br/>
led us to the very top of the high cliff known as Arthur's Seat which<br/>
was the highest peak of rocks anywhere in this region and a good part<br/>
of the way up was almost perpendicular. I was informed that<br/>
Elder [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] while he was establishing the Bra[n]ch in [[Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland|Edinborough]]<br/>
which he found about as difficult as we did the establishing of the<br/>
work in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]], would frequently go to the top of this rock as a<br/>
place of retreat and meditation.</p>

<p>From this rock we had a full view of<br/>
the whole city of Edinborough and the surrounding country which<br/>
presented to us a sublime prospect. I was quite unwell with<br/>
a severe cold and and felt wearied in reaching the top of this rock<br/>
or Arthours Seat which was also the case with the rest of the brethren<br/>
as far as fatigue was concerned</p>

<p>When we had sufficiently viewed the<br/>
country around we returned took dinner and then visited several<br/>
of the Saints and in the evening we held a council meeting<br/>
of the officers.</p>

<p>The day after we parted with the Saints <br/>
in Edinborough took the rail to [[Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland|Glasgow]] where we spent 3 hours<br/>
with the brethren then continued by rail to [[Greenock, Renfrewshire, Scotland|Grenock]] and<br/>
thence by steamboat for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]. Elder [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and<br/>
myself were together; brother [[Thomas Ward|Ward]] had been left in Edinborough<br/>
by accident</p>

<p>We had a disgreaable night on board and<br/>
I arrived in Liverpool sick and weary and for several day continued<br/>
unwell and mostly unfit for business</p>

<p>On my return I received several <strike>of</strike><br/>
numbers of the Times and Seasons and Neighbour and<br/>
the New York Prophet also a letter from Elder [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A Smith]].</p>",

<p>The representation of the Elders showed that<br/>
at this date the Liverpool Conference comprised 12 Branches with<br/>
676 members 30 Elders 39 Priests 21 Teachers 10 Deacons and<br/>
31 baptized since the last Quarterly Conference. Brothers Brown<br/>
and Wilson were chosen del<strike>i</strike>agates to the coming General Conference<br/>
of the British mission.</p>

<p>On the First of the month I wrote a large sheet full<br/>
of matter to President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] concerning the affairs<br/>
of the Church over which I was presiding and the progress of the<br/>
work in [[Europe|Europe]]</p>

<p>Rumours of wars between [[England|England]] and the<br/>
United States were again heard through the land. The American<br/>
Government having anexed [[Texas|Texas]] to the United States there seemed<br/>
a prospect of England joining [[Mexico|Mexico]] in a war. Quite an<br/>
excitement was created among the American captains in<br/>
consequence of the English Government having stoped the steampacket<br/>
which was to sail on the 4th until further orders.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/04/1845
42658.0,117,,""">4th</time> I took the train with [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Mrs<br/>

by Elders Stratton [[Milton Holmes|Holmes]] and [[James Darling Ross|Ross]]</p>",
42658.0,118,1845-04-06,"<p>Next day I had an interview with many<br/>

<p>This was our yearly General Conference of the various<br/>
Conferences of the Church throughout the United Kingdom of<br/>
[[Great Britain|Great Britain]] and which was held as in America on the anaversary<br/>
of the rise of the Church</p>

<p>A large assembly of Saints and friends<br/>
came together at an early hour. Elder Woodruff presided<br/>
supported by his counsellors [[Reuben Hedlock|Reuben Hedlock]] and [[Thomas Ward|Tho<sup>s</sup> Ward]].</p>

<p>After the Conference was duly opened the<br/>
President called upon the delegates to represent the various conferences<br/>
of the British Mission which occupied the forenoon. It was<br/>
much the largest representation ever given in England up to this<br/>
date notwithstanding our emigrations.</p>

<p>The afternoon was occupied by the Delegates<br/>
in representing the condition of their Conferences and the evening<br/>
was spent in the same manner and the Hall was filled with<br/>
a large assembly.</p>

<p>At the close of the evening I occupied<br/>
a few moments as delegate from America in representing<br/>
my Conference consisting of the United States containing</p>",
42658.0,119,,"<p>one Quorum of the Twelve Apostles one High Council, 300 High Priests,<br/>
1050 of the Seventies 5000 Elders and about the same number of Priests Teachers<br/>
and Deacons and about one hundred thousand members including the<br/>
officers generally in very good standing, having built several towns and<br/>
one city with a population of 15,000 souls, built two Temples and laid<br/>
the foundation of another suffered much persecution and 50 or more of<br/>
its members had sealed their testimony with their blood but still it was in<br/>
a good state of prosperity.</p>

<p>General Conference re-assembled next morning at 10<br/>
o'clock at Mr Haywood's Room the usual meeting place of the Church at<br/>
[[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and the first business presented was the Joint Stock Company<br/>
A committee of ten was chosen to withdraw from the body of the<br/>
Conference and form an instrument in writing as a Constitution for the<br/>
society.</p>

<p>The Committee of the Joint Stock Company<br/>
accordingly withdrew and sat in Council most of the time for 24<br/>
hours and while that was going on the President and his counsellors<br/>
continued the business of the General Conference in making changes<br/>
of Elders giving appointments settling difficulties and putting<br/>
things generally in order</p>

<p>The two last days of the conference was occupied<br/>
mostly with the business of the Joint Stock Company and at the close Elders<br/>
[[Elisha Hildebrand Davis|Elisha H Davis]] &amp; [[Elijah Funk Sheets|Elijah F. Sheets]] were ordained into the quorum of the Seventies<br/>

around [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] visiting the Churches and the Saints at their homes myself<br/>
and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] returned to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]. Here I found letters at the office for me<br/>
two of which was from President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]]. These letters were<br/>
full of public interest and brother Brigham's spoke of the progress of<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and affairs of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]].</p>

<p>The Maynooth Grant</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/21/1845
42658.0,120,1845-04-23,""">21st</time> I attended a meeting appointed by the minister<br/>
of the Church of England for the purpose of opposing the Maynooth<br/>
Grant which was then under discussion in the British Parliament<br/>
The whole country was in an excitement upon the matter and alarm<br/>
was created throughout the Protestant Churches of [[England|England]]. The meeting<br/>
was held in the Music Hall where the Saints held their services and<br/>
the celebrated Rev [[Hugh M|Hugh M<sup>c</sup>Neile]] was chairman. The speakers<br/>
considered that Parliament was betraying the country and striking<br/>
a death blow at ^the^ three hundred years of reformation. Many addresses<br/>
were made and resolutions formed and the meeting broke up at<br/>
half past ten.</p>

<p>I spent the <time datetime=""",04/23/1845
42658.0,120,,""">23<sup><u>rd</u></sup></time> at the Office examining the<br/>
and aranging the trunk and relics of our departed friend and brother<br/>
[[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Lorenzo D. Barnes]]. I carefully filed all his corresepondence and packed<br/>
in his trunk together with his own compositions Journals Patriarchal<br/>
Blessings &amp;c also a dozen or more of choice coin of ancient date and<br/>
characters which he probably collected for the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Museum<br/>
with one weight the standard for a sovereign and his finger ring all<br/>
of which I carefully put in a package and sealed it with wax and<br/>
stamped it with a large seal.</p>

<p>Upon the outside<br/>
of this package I wrote the contents and directed it to the<br/>
President of the Church in Nauvoo. Besides this I packed<br/>
his carpet bag a splendid Buffalo robe worked with Indian beads<br/>
overcoat dress coat various other clothing 2 cases of razors two</p>",
42658.0,121,,"<p>pocket books containing deeds of land and other papers a crown piece in a small<br/>
pocket book for the Museum at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and a variety of other things all of which<br/>
I carefully packed to be sent to Nauvoo</p>

<p>A Dream.</p>

<p>After retiring to rest this night I fell asleep and dreamt that I<br/>
had just returned to Nauvoo from my English mission and was in company<br/>
with a number of the Twelve and other brethren. We met with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
the Prophet and I shook hands with him and asked him if he and his<br/>
family were well. He said they were. I thought the endowment<br/>
had been given and he was counselling us about taking a mission<br/>
abroad. While talking he sat in a chair and leaned upon his breast<br/>
He said he was going to take a mission to [[India|India]] and pointed out the<br/>
man to go with him but I cannot now call him by name. [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A. Smith]] asked liberty of Joseph to spend more time with me that<br/>
we might be prepared to take a mission together which was granted<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] had his mission appointed but I do not know where;<br/>
[[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] was spoken of but I do not recollect what was said.<br/>
We had an interesting time together and all seamed happy to<br/>
see the Prophet again.</p>

Tomb Stone of [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Lorenzo D Barnes]]</p>

<p>I sent to Elder [[Elijah Funk Sheets|E. F. Sheets]] the following epitah for the<br/>
tombstone:<br/>
""In memory of Lorenzo D. Barnes who died on the<br/>
20th of December 1842 aged 30 years. He was a native of the<br/>
United States an Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter<br/>
Day Saints a member of the High Priest Quorum and also of<br/>
Zions Camp in A.D. 1834 and the first Gospel Messenger<br/>
from Nauvoo who has found a grave in a foreign land.</p>",

The conquered tomb shall yeild her captive prey<br/>
Then with thy Quorum shaL thou reign in bliss<br/>
As King and Priest for an eternal day.</p>

<p>The same evening I rode to Newton in company<br/>
with Bro [[James Ferguson|James Ferguson]] and here I stayed with that Branch of<br/>
Saints for several days.</p>

<p>During my stay at Newton I with several<br/>
friends went to see the Muspratt Vitrol works carried on in<br/>
their various branches. It is one of the most lucrative businesses<br/>
in the world but very disagreeable and unhealthy. The fires are<br/>
fed with brimstone and the smoke of the whole works is carried<br/>
off through a brick chimney 138 feet in circumferance and 396<br/>
in height and often the air is so impregnated in the dirrection<br/>
that the smoke goes even at a great distance that one can<br/>
only with difficulty breathe in it.</p>

<p>After leaving these works I visited each<br/>
appartment of the Newton Engine factory where a large number<br/>
of engines are made for the railroad. We have several of the<br/>
brethren at work there who could carry on the business in all its branches</p>

<p>From the Newton Engine Factory I<br/>
walked several miles through a very pleasant scenery surrounded<br/>
with green fields hedges trees and gardens and visited the Church. On<br/>
the side of the building was the figure of a pig in stone with<br/>
a stone hung around its neck. The tradition is that the materials<br/>
for the Church was drawn to another place quite a distance<br/>
from where the Church now stands and the pig came along and<br/>
took a stone in his mouth and carried it along squeeling and<br/>
laid it down where the Church now stands. The people<br/>
took it as an omen that they should build the Church there<br/>
and they did.</p>

<p>I returned from my walk to Bro [[John Nuttall|Nuttall]]'s</p>",
42658.0,123,1845-05-05,"<p>laid hands upon [[John Nuttall|his]] sick child had prayers with the Saints and departed<br/>
for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]].</p>

<p>In the beginning of May I visited the Churches<br/>
at [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] and [[Blackburn, Lancashire, England|Blackburn]] and with brother [[William Speakman|Speakman]] on the <time datetime=""",05/05/1845
42658.0,123,,""">5</time>th<br/>
I walked from the latter place to [[Whalley, Lancashire, England|Whalley]] and visited its old Abbey<br/>
which was the largest I had ever been into. It covered several acres<br/>
of ground &amp; was nearly in total ruins except a small portion of it<br/>
which is inhabited by a few families. The Abbey is 800 years<br/>
old and was built A.D. 1,000.</p>

<p><u>Stoneyhurst</u>—<u>The</u> <u>Jesuits</u> <u>College</u></p>

<p>Next day Brother Speakman and myself walked to<br/>
Stoneyhurst and went through every appartment of the <u>Jesuits</u><br/>
<u>College</u> which was the only college of the kind in [[England|England]]<br/>
We inspected each department of the rare and splendid paintings<br/>
and of the library which was very extensive containing many<br/>
very ancient writings and parchment manuscripts. There<br/>
was the prayer book of Mary Queen of England and a copy<br/>
of St. [[Paul (NT)|Paul]]'s Epistles one thousand years old. We went<br/>
through their museum studies lodgings chapels &amp;c containing<br/>
many rare and curious things. There were many paintings<br/>
and figures of Christ and some of the images of the Saviour<br/>
on the cross in fine marble cost £700. We went into<br/>
the chapel of the boys educated there and also into the main<br/>
chapel one of the windows of which with the paintings of the<br/>
Twelve Apostles on it cost two thousand pounds and<br/>
the candlesticks crosses and all the furnature were very choice<br/>
and costly.</p>

<p>We visited each <strike>appartmant</strike> part of the gardans which wer devided<br/>
by walks bordered by the ewe tree which formed the whole into departments. This<br/>
ewe tree border was about 4 feet thick 12 feet high and from 40 to 200 feet long<br/>
varying in the departments and these borders were as straight and smooth as a<br/>
plastered wall</p>",
42658.0,124,,"<p>After going through this noted College and its gardens<br/>
we walked to [[Waddington, Lancashire, England|Waddington]] and visited the Almshouses built and<br/>
dedicated by Sir [[Robert Parker, b. 1633|Robert Parker]] in 1,700. to the poor widows of<br/>
the parish. There were twentyfive dwellings and a small<br/>
garden to each. These houses were occupied by aged widows<br/>
the youngest of whom was sixty years of age and the oldest<br/>
87. They appeared quite comfortable. We stoped at Waddington for the night.</p>

<p>[FIGURE]<br/>
Thence next day to [[Clitheroe, Lancashire, England|Clithero]] then to<br/>
[[Chatburn, Lancashire, England|Chatburn]] and we walked through the street that the Apostle<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] walked through with his hat off and<br/>
blessed the place. I felt the Spirit of God rest upon me<br/>
while walking over the same road.</p>

<p>^<u>A</u> <u>Day</u> <u>at </u><u>Fishing</u>^ I went fishing the following day<br/>
with Father [[Richard Smithies|Richard Smithies]] in the river Ribble. He was<br/>
70 years of age and ^was^ considered the greatest fisher^man^ in that country<br/>
He fished with the fly and it being the first time I had ever<br/>
witnessed it I was delighted with this ingenious art of fishing and<br/>
the dexterity of the fisherman. The fishing rod was about<br/>
14 feet long very slender and his long fine line made of hair and<br/>
catgut was wound round a small brass wheel with a little crank to it<br/>
and fastened to the but end of the pole. The line then runs through<br/>
half a dozen brass rings or ilot holes fastened at regular distances<br/>
along the rod to the small end of it. On the line are<br/>
five or six artificial flies about two feet apart fastened by<br/>
catgut almost as fine as a hair. Twenty or thirty feet of the<br/>
line is unwound from the reel at the but of the rod and thrown<br/>
upon the water and the fly hooks swim down the stream and<br/>
the trout th^aking^ them as natural flies are hooked as<br/>
soon as they bite. If they are large trout and run, they<br/>
of themselves unwind as much line as they want from the<br/>
reel and when the fish are thus worried in the water until they<br/>
struggle no longer the fisherman draws them to the bank<br/>
by the line or to himself if he stands in the water and</p>",
42658.0,125,1845-05-11,"<p>then with a small hand^net^ on a pole of 5 or 6 feet puts it under the trout ^%^ very<br/>
deliberatly takes it out of the water. The fishermen have flies varying<br/>
for almost every mouth imitating the natural flies which swim upon the<br/>
water at the time they fish. These flies are made of feathers of birds<br/>
of different colours and the trout will often take them before the natural<br/>
fly</p>

<p>Father [[Richard Smithies|Smithies]] caught 7 trout and 2 cheven<br/>
I was much gratified with the days fishing and after our return<br/>
sister [[Elizabet Parkinson|Parkinson]] cooked the trout which made a good meal.</p>

<p>[[Clitheroe, Lancashire, England|Clithero]] Quarterly Conference</p>

<p>Held Sunday the <time datetime=""",05/11/1845
42658.0,125,1845-05-15,""">11th of May 1845</time></p>

<p>Elder [[William Speakman|Speakman]] was called to preside. The Churches were<br/>
represented some aterations made and officers ordained in the morning<br/>
In the afternoon sacrament was administered and the power of<br/>
God rested so abundantly upon the congregation that many were<br/>
melted into tears.</p>

<p>This is the Conference brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] speaks<br/>
of in his journal. I do not wonder that he wept when he left<br/>
then for I was myself so overwhelmed with the spirit and power<br/>
of God and simplicity of the people that I could scarcely speak<br/>
They were like little children and as pure minded and innocent as <br/>
angels. Many of them bore their testimony to the work of God.</p>

<p>I returned next day to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] and there met<br/>
Elders [[Milton Holmes|Holmes]] and [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Hardy]] and preached at night from the CII<br/>
Psalm and on the day after I reached [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]].</p>

<p>I stayed at home first two days and<br/>
then started to attened the Carlisle Conference. I took ^the^ steamer<br/>
for [[Carlisle, Cumberland, England|Carlisle]] at 4 p.m. on the <time datetime=""",05/15/1845
42658.0,125,,""">15</time>th and as the boat was newly</p>",
42658.0,126,,"<p>painted from stern to stem and one could not touch ^or sit^ anywhere without carrying<br/>
away the paint my last resort was to pay 2 shillings for the use of a<br/>
bunk among the Sailors. I had no sooner gone below than I was<br/>
enveloped in the most horrid stench I ever smelt arising from the<br/>
cargo consisting of <u>guano</u>. I laid down but was as sick as death<br/>
and vomitted at intervals for five hours and my stomach being empty<br/>
I strained at such a degree that blood ran out of my nose almost<br/>
a stream. I suffered much through the night and the sailors<br/>
smoked their pipes and filled the place with tobaco smoke which<br/>
though nacious to me was better than the stench of the cargo. I<br/>
thought it the most horrid night I ever spent at sea.</p>

<p>We arrived at [[Port Carlisle, Cumberland, England|Port Carlisle]] at 9 o'clock in<br/>
the morning. I then crossed the ferry and took the canal boat to<br/>
[[Carlisle, Cumberland, England|Carlisle]].</p>

<p>With brothers Kent and [[James Allen|Allen]] the next<br/>
day I went through the town of Carlisle. It was anciently walled<br/>
in with a high strong wall most of which was taken down in<br/>
building the city. We walked upon some portion of the<br/>
walls which still stood and visited the old St. Marys Church and<br/>
Abbey about eleven hundred years of age. Portions of the Church<br/>
was the ancient building itself and the remainder had been prepainted<br/>
We also visited the Carlisle castle which gave us a fair view of<br/>
the surrounding country and among other things of note with which<br/>
we made ourselves acquainted was a very valuable painting by<br/>
<u>Edward</u> <u>Rancier</u> which we saw at Mr [[Charles Thurnum|Charles Thurnum]]'s<br/>
Stationer's Shop. It represented a blacksmith in the act of<br/>
shoeing a bay horse with a donkey by his side and a dog sitting<br/>
on the ground with the tool box anvil tools &amp;c scattered around<br/>
It was such a life picture that it seemed more than a mere<br/>
painting. Five thousand pounds had frequently been offered<br/>
for it and refused. They sold the engravings for 5 pounds<br/>
each and it was supposed that no living artist except<br/>
<u>Rancier</u> could paint such a picture.</p>",

<p>This conference had not met before for 4 years and<br/>
as it was somewhat a special meeting now Elder Woodruff was called to<br/>
the chair and [[Joseph Maughen|Joseph Maughen]] clerk.</p>

<p>The representation showed the conference to consist<br/>
of the Branches of Carlisle [[Brampton, Cumberland, England|Brampton]] [[Alston, Cumberland, England|Alston]] [[Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, England|New Castle]] [[Sunderland, Durham, England|Sunderland]] and<br/>
[[Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland|Dunfries]] and containing 165 members</p>

<p>The necessary business in putting the Churches<br/>
in order was attended to sacrament partaken of and in the evening<br/>
the president of the meeting preached to a crowded house upon the rise<br/>
and progress of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints<br/>
which closed the conference</p>

<p>I parted from the Saints of Carlisle and<br/>
returned to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] by the same steamer in which I came. It had<br/>
on board 400 sheep and some horses and cattle which nearly covered the entire<br/>
deck yet the sailors found space large enough to fight on. About<br/>
a dozen of them got at it which left many bloody noses and sore heads<br/>
We had a very good passage however.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May which was the seventh day of the week and on this the Sabbath day of ancient Israel<br/>
at 6 o'clock in the morning the last stone was laid on the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]<br/>
of the Lord at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with shouts of grace unto it. Glory to<br/>
God in the Highest who finished his work on the seventh day<br/>

<p>As refered to elsewhere in my autobiography I had received a<br/>
copy of a letter from [[John Greenhow|John Greenhow]] to his [[Father Greenhow|father]] in [[England|England]]<br/>
stating that he was stereotyping the Book of Doctrine and Covenants<br/>
up the Chuch at an expence of $300 and that he would be in<br/>
England about the 1st of May when he should strike off a<br/>
few copies of the book and deprive us of the privilege of printing<br/>
it. This was to be kept a profound secret but through the<br/>
mercy of God the knowledge fell into my hands and I as<br/>
the lawful agent of the Church immediately employed a printer<br/>
and printed three thousand copies. And on this <time datetime=""",06/07/1845
42658.0,128,,""">7th of<br/>

got my receipt for it</p>

<p>I spent several weeks in London and while<br/>
there the case of Elder [[James Albon|Albon]] was before the Church. He was the<br/>
minister of the Indipendant Connection whom we baptized at<br/>
the commencement of the work in London on my former mission<br/>
to England. He was brought to trial for resisting the order<br/>
and counsel of the Church and at a meeting on the 19th of<br/>
June when his case was brought up for the last time for<br/>
settlement he defended himself with a heart full of envy and<br/>
accusation but acknowledged what was brought against him</p>",
42658.0,129,,"<p>and said that [[James Albon|he]] should continue his course baptizing on and<br/>
ordaining in his own way. A vote was taken and he was cut<br/>
off from the Church a second time.</p>

<p>While in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] on this occassion I also revisited<br/>
many of the noted places and things of the city and subburbs and saw<br/>
some alterations and additions but the most famous of the fresh things<br/>
which I saw and which I had never visited before was</p>

<p>[FIGURE]<br/>
The Unrivalled Exhibition of Madame [[Anna Maria Grosholtz Tussaud|Tussaud]]<br/>
and Sons<br/>
<u>Bazar Becker Street Portman Square</u></p>

<p>I have never in my travels seen anything which could<br/>
begin to compare with this exhibition. On entering I purchassed a<br/>
book of the contents of each room. Here were life representations<br/>
of the kings and queens of [[England|England]] for centuries with their courts at various<br/>
periods, also the kings and emperors of other nations of [[Europe|Europe]] with<br/>
a grand marshalling of celebrated poets orators and renowned men<br/>
of the earth with the due proportion of unenviable notorious characters<br/>
Among the rest stood our own [[George Washington|Washington]] in his dress of state and<br/>
Byron [[William Shakespeare|Shakspeare]] Voltaire Luther Calvin [[John Knox|Knox]] Wesley and<br/>
a host of like celebrities. And what makes the exhibition so<br/>
interesting is the fact that we find there not only the best possible<br/>
representations of the persons of the grand array of famous characters<br/>
but also the very dresses &amp;c which they wore in life even to the<br/>
coronation robes of royalty with their diamonds stars precious stones<br/>
and all the gorgeous paraphernalia of everything famous in the<br/>
present and past. Here is Napoleon the 1st represented under<br/>
almost every circumstance of his life and the Sleeping Beauty<br/>
of [[France|France]] with her jewels and necklace of brilliants with her<br/>
bosom heaving with the soft regular breathing of sleep looking as natural<br/>
as life as does ^also^ the other figures. Indeed to such an extent</p>",
42658.0,130,,"<p>is this life like illusion sustained everwhere in this famous Bazaar that<br/>
visitors often find the novelty of taking these wax figures for living<br/>
persons. I myself was in one case particularly taken in with<br/>
the apparant life reality of a respectable old gentleman ^setting^ by my<br/>
side. The following is an extract of some of some of the<br/>
personages and things which I saw at the Bazaar of Madame<br/>

sons of peers. The robe on the right under the looking glass was used<br/>
at the opening of Parliament that on the left was the purple or imperial<br/>
robe used on his Majestys return from the Abb[e]y. These three robes</p>",
42658.0,131,,"<p>contain five hundred and sixty seven feet of velvet and embroi<strike>y</strike>dery with the ermine<br/>

of Russia offering on behalf of the Allied monarchs the Kingdom of France. The<br/>
intention of this group is to show ^in view^ the principal actors in a which never had<br/>
a parallel and to give effect to the view the allied monarchs are supposed<br/>
to be offering to Napoleon the kingdom of France as it was under Louis XIV<br/>
(an historical fact) which he refused prefering to risk the chance of war<br/>
against Europe in arms rather than give up his pretentions to universal<br/>
dominion. Napoleon, grasping the sword which won him empire points<br/>
to his favorite Eagle and and determines to fulfil his destiny. The<br/>
Eagle surmounting the whole was presented by Napoleon to his Imperial<br/>
Guard and was taken at Waterloo by the Prussians <strike> under <u>Von</u></strike> ^Blucher^<br/>

<p><u>Relics</u> <u>of</u> <u>Napoleon</u></p>

<p>The celebrated and identical camp-bed used by Napoleon 7 years<br/>
at St. Hellena with the original mattress and pillows on<br/>
which he died. Here ^he^ is lying in state in his chasseur uniform<br/>
covered with the identical cloak worn by him at Marengo<br/>
and prized so highly that he expressly left it by will to his<br/>
son the King of Rome. In it he laid in soldier's glory and<br/>
it served as his pall to the grave. They paid for the bed<br/>
alone £550 for the Tussaud Bazaar. Here is the<br/>
coronation robe of Napoleon and also the coronation robe of<br/>
the Empress Josephine the train of which at her coronation was<br/>
borne by four queens. A figure of Napoleon in the identical<br/>
clothes worn by him ^at^ St. Hellena, waistcoast smallclothes stockings<br/>
morning gown and sword belt. The celebrated flag of Elba which<br/>
Napoleon presented to the National guards at Elba afterwards<br/>
used by him on his return to France. It was again presented<br/>
to his guard before the battle of Waterloo and was taken by<br/>
the Prussians. This flag accompanied Napoleon in the most<br/>
interesting portion of his marvellous history. There were figures<br/>
of Josephine in her Imperia costume Prince Lucien The<br/>
King of Rome Madame Mere Napoleon's mother his<br/>
sister the wife of Murat and Queen of Naples and Napoleon<br/>
crossing the Alps. In this room Napoleon is represented</p>",
42658.0,135,,"<p>under four phases—as a general a the E^m^peror as the Exile and lastly<br/>
in death. One of the most famous of the Napoleonic relics is<br/>
the carriage of Napoleon in which he made the campaign of<br/>
Russia and which was captured on the eve of the battle of Waterloo<br/>
and sent with the officer who took it to the Regent of England from<br/>
whom it was purchased for 2,500. It accompanied the Emperor in<br/>
many of his campaigns and was used by him as sovereign of Elba<br/>
It was constructed so as to make good accomodations for riding sleeping<br/>
writing eating storing arms &amp;c. I sat in this carriage in which<br/>
the great Napoleon had sat so many anxious hours and from which<br/>
he gave command in his final battle—Waterloo. There was<br/>
also the identical sword worn by him during his campaign in<br/>
Egypt and a host of other relics but probably the most curious<br/>
relic is the counterpane used on the camp-bed on which Napoleon<br/>
died, <u>marked</u> with his <u>blood</u></p>

<p>[[Leamington, Warwickshire, England|Lemington]] is one of the first aristocratic towns in<br/>
[[England|England]] which the Nobility and gentry visit as one of their select places<br/>
and in consequence of its sulphur springs. The streets and buildings<br/>
of the town are rich and splendid in appearance.</p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Visit</u> <u>to</u> <u>[[Warwick Castle, Warwick, Warwickshire, England|Warwich]]</u> <u>Castle</u></p>

<p>In company of about a dozen Saints I visited<br/>
the Warwic<strike>h</strike>k castle and tower. It is considered the most splendid<br/>
castle in England and is furnished with all the magnificence which art<br/>
and the wealth of Earldom could bestow upon it.</p>

<p>The main body of the castle was 333 ft<br/>
long divided into its various rooms. The walls were hung with rich<br/>
gorgeous tapestry the rooms furnished with the costliest furniture<br/>
and the richest damask-covered chairs tables and stands inlaid<br/>
with pearl shell and precious stones. Some of these articles cost<br/>
£15,000 each and would take three years for the artizen to make.</p>

<p>This castle contained a great variety of<br/>
Paintings and portraits of Kings Queens Lords Orators Reformers<br/>
and nobles. One among the gallery of portraits was the founder of <br/>
the Jesuits.</p>

<p>From the windows of the castle we looked<br/>
out upon stately ceders of Lebanon oak firs and other shrubs and<br/>
saw the pleasure grounds of forty acres and a park five miles in<br/>
circumferance: This castle was 800 years old and the Tower<br/>
500 years old and 150 feet high. We went to the top of it and had a<br/>
magnificient view of all the surrounding country.</p>

<p>In a small room at the entrance of the<br/>
castle we had a view of the armoury of the celebrated Guy<br/>
His helmet breastplate and shield weighs 120 pounds and his <br/>
sword 20 lbs. His copper porage pot holds 120 gallons and<br/>
six grown persons of us sat in it at the same time.</p>",
42658.0,139,,"<p>In the evening I took the train in company with Elder<br/>
[[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and rode to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]. On our arrival we found Elder [[Robert Crook|Crook]]<br/>
waiting for us. We accompanied him to the Hall of the Latter-day<br/>
Saints where we found between 4 and 5 hundred of the Saints sitting<br/>
at a general tea table. As we entered the door the clapping of<br/>
hands and stomping of feet that welcomed us made the room tremble<br/>
and it was with difficulty that I could get to the stand and all wished to<br/>
shake hands with me as I passed along.</p>

<p>After taking a repast with this warm hearted<br/>
band of brethren and sisters I addressed them for about the space of<br/>
an hour clothed with the Spirit and power of God. I was followed by<br/>
Elder Hedlock and we spent a good time together.</p>

<p>Next day I left Birmingham for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]</p>

<p>On the 14th and 15th of the month in Liverpool I sat<br/>
with the board of Directors of the British and American Joint Stock<br/>
Company until near midnight of the second day. It was a hard day's<br/>
work and a critical one. Each article of the deed for settlement<br/>
preparing for regestration was read over several times changed and<br/>
altered as the Board of Directors thought fit.</p>

<p>It had been with much labour care and<br/>
expence to get this Joint Stock Company settled so as to begin to<br/>
do business and during the day I had many trying things to<br/>
encounter. My spirit was greived and insulted as it had been many<br/>
times since I came to Liverpool from a source that I ought<br/>
to have expected better things.</p>

<p>We got the Nauvoo Times and Neighbor<br/>
and New York Messenger informing us of the commencing of mobing<br/>
once more in [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]]. The mob had burned 42 houses<br/>
of the Saints in [[Lima, Adams County, Illinois|Lima]]; and a day or two later the Liverpool<br/>
papers teemed with rumours that mobs were raging against<br/>
the Saints in Hancock Co. had burned severed hundred of their<br/>
houses and that a proposition had been made by the Twelve<br/>
to the citizens of <strike>Hancock County for the Mormons to leave</strike> ^that they would leave the State as soon as they could dispose of their property^</p>",

On the 24th I met with Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and [[Thomas Ward|Ward]]<br/>
and laid before them my feelings concerning our situation in<br/>
[[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] both temporally and spiritually. There had not<br/>
been a good understanding between us for some time but I told<br/>
these brethren what I wished to be done and seemingly our<br/>
meeting was profitable and at the close of our consultation we<br/>
bowed our knees together before God.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of the follow[ing] <br/>
month I received intelligence from President [[Brigham Young|Young]] that<br/>
the State of [[Illinois|Illinois]] would not protect the citizens of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
and that the only terms of peace granted at all was upon condition<br/>
of our people leaving the State. The Presidency of the Church and<br/>
the community themselves had been under the necessity of agreeing<br/>
to leave the State of Illinois the next Spring. I wrote in <br/>
return to President Young expressing my feelings severely upon<br/>
this extermination of the Saints and asked his counsel whether<br/>
I should tarry in [[England|England]] or return to America. I also sent<br/>
him a duplicate of the entering of the copyright of the</p>",
42658.0,141,1845-11-30,"<p>Books of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants.</p>

<p>I also notified the Presiding Elders of the British <br/>
mission of a Special General Conference to be held at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]<br/>
on the 14th day of December 1845.</p>

with them for a season, it created much excitement. <br/>
I had appointments out for a week, which I got Bro. <br/>
[[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] to fill. I went before the Lord in prayer and <br/>
asked him where I should go, the Spirit said, go to the <br/>
south. According to the directions of the Spirit, on the <br/>
3rd <strike>March</strike> I went to [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], and called upon<br/>
[[John Benbow|John Benbow]] at [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castlefroom]]; <strike>here</strike> I found a people <br/>
prepared for the Gospel. I preached twice at his house. <br/>
On the 6<u>th</u> I baptized 6 persons including John Benbow <br/>
and [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]]. I here found a society called ""United <br/>
Brethren,"" numbering about six hundred members, <br/>
and about 50 preachers, [[Thomas Kington|Tho<sup><u>s</u></sup>. Kington]] was the presiding Elder; <br/>
they came from all quarters to hear me preach and <br/>
believed my testimony and I preached and baptized <br/>
daily; the Ministers of the Church of England sent three <br/>
church clerks to see what I was doing and I baptized <br/>
them. One constable came to arrest me for preaching, and <br/>
I baptized him. In about 30 days <strike>days</strike> I baptized 160, <br/>
forty eight of <strike>which</strike> ^whom^ were preachers of the United <br/>
Brethren including their presiding Elder, Thomas <br/>
Kington.</p>

<br/>
<p>I established forty two preaching places licensed <br/>
according to law.</p>

<br/>
<p>On the 9th April I had an appointment at [[Hawcross, Redmarley D|Haw<br/>
Cross]], as I was going into the meeting, letters were put <br/>
into my hands from Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and others <br/>
informing me of his arrival with five of the Twelve,<br/>
and requested me to come to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], and attend a <br/>
general conference,— a vast assembly had gathered <strike>at</strike><br/>
to attend my meeting, the house, yard and street <br/>
w<s>as</s>ere crowded, a mob had also gathered; I preached <br/>
to the people, five came forward <strike>and wished</strike> to be baptized</p>

",
374.0,38,,"<p></p><p>the mob surrounded the pool, armed with stones, I <br/>
dismissed the meeting and went away, but the congregation <br/>
and mob remained on the ground till midnight, and <br/>
as there was no prospect of their dispersing and the candidates <br/>
were anxious to be baptized, I went down in to the water <br/>
and baptized five in the mist of a shower of stones,<br/>
the water was all in a foam for a rod around me,<br/>
none that I baptized were hit, and I was only hit <br/>
twice, once on my hip and once on my head, the <s>one</s> ^blow^ on <br/>
my head raised a large bump, <strike>it</strike> which went away while<br/>
I was confirming: <s>S</s>^s^ubsequently I baptized many of the mob.</p>

<br/>
<p><strike>Subsequently</strike> I left next morning for [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] and attended <br/>
the conference with the Twelve, and returned to [[Herefordshire, England|Hereforshire]]<br/>
accompanied by Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], on the 22nd April, <br/>
and was soon joined by Elder [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]. Elder <br/>
Young remained <strike>with me</strike> twenty seven days, preaching,<br/>
baptizing, confirming and counciling; numbers were added <br/>
daily to the church: he then returned to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]].</p>

<br/>
<p>I spent about seven months in Herefordshire, <br/>
[[Gloucestershire, England|Glo^uce^stershire]] and [[Worcestershire, England|Worcestershire]], we baptized over <br/>
eighteen hundred including all of the United Brethren <br/>
save one: we baptized over two hundred preachers <br/>
of various denominations in that part of the vinyard</p>

Bible as their hunting grounds, and were as much interested <br/>
in the welfare of the souls of men, as the chasing of the <br/>
stags and foxes, they would not loose so many of their congregations.</p>

I had the happy privilege of meeting with the Prophets [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>

bro. [[James Williams|James Williams]] in [[Iowa|Iowa]], to camp for the night; I tied my mules to a<br/>
large oak tree several rods from the carriage; as we were about to lay down<br/>
in the carriage for the night, I was strongly impressed to go and move my<br/>
mules from the oak tree, and also to move my carriage; I followed the<br/>
dictates of the Spirit, and removed my mules to a small hickory grove,<br/>
also moved my carriage several rods, and retired to rest.</p>

<br/>
<p>In a short time a heavy rain storm came on, which broke<br/>
the tree near the ground, and laid it prostrate where my carriage had stood,<br/>
as it was, the top struck the hind end of the carriage; the tree was<br/>
2 feet in diameter; thus, by obeying the whisperings of the spirit, myself<br/>

painful <strike>scenes of my life</strike> and serious misfortune of any of my life<br/>
I took my ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the bluffs to cut some shingle<br/>
timber to cover my cabin I was acompanied by two other men and<br/>
while falling the third tree ^which was an oak over two feet in diameter^ I steped backed of it some 8 feet and also one<br/>
side about the same distance where I thought I was entirely out of danger<br/>
but when the tree fell (<strike>being over two feet in diameter</strike>) ther being a crook<br/>
in the body of it, it struck a knowl on the ground and the whole body of the tree<br/>
shot end ways back of the stump and bounded &amp; the but of the tree struck<br/>
me in the breast and knocked me several in the air against a standing<br/>
Oak and the falling tree followed me in its bend and caught me<br/>
against the standing tree and I came down between ^the two trees^ <strike>them</strike> one<br/>
standing &amp; the other falling but before reaching the ground I was<br/>
liberated from between them and struck the ground upon my feet.<br/>
It badly bruised my left thigh the whole leangth of it and my hip<br/>
also my left arm it also broak my breast bone into also 3 ribs<br/>
on my left side it also bruised my lungs, vitals, and left side in<br/>
a shocking manor. After the accident I sat upon a log untill<br/>
Mr [[John Garrison|John Garrison]] went a quarter of a mile to get my horse. Notwith-<br/>
standing I was so badly hurt I had to mount my horse and ride<br/>
2 1/2 miles over a very rough road and had to dismout twice in<br/>
consequence of miry places, my breast and vitals was so badly torn<br/>
to peaces that each step of the horse went through me like an arrow<br/>
I continued on horsback untill I arived at [[Turkey Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turky Creek]] on the<br/>
North side of Winter Quarters I then became exhausted &amp; was taken<br/>
off and carried in a chair to my waggon not having <strike>a</strike> ^my^ cabin built<br/>
I was met in the street by president [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]], [[Willard Richards|W<br/>

me upon my bed the presidency [[laying on of hands|laid hands]] upon me rebuked my suffering<br/>
&amp; distress in the name of the Lord and said I should live and<br/>
not die. I was then laid upon my bed in my waggon and as<br/>

appeared miraculous to me that with all the injuries and broken bones<br/>

been enabled ever since to endure the hardest manual labor,<br/>

60 miles in a day. However if I over labor or take a severe cold I<br/>
feel it more sensibly in my breast and left side than I did<br/>
before my last injury.  Thus I have occupied considerable space in<br/>
referring to those peculiar circumstances which here attending me ^thus far^ during life<br/>

mercies of God have been over me, and my life has thus far<br/>
been preseved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to render<br/>

<p><u>Man</u> <u>Overboard</u></p>

<p>About a week after we set sail during a <br/>
<strike>roughish day</strike> ^storm^ the second mate steped forward to the bow<br/>
of the ship and ordered one of the hands to do something on<br/>
the bowsprit who refused upon the plea that it was<br/>
dangerous and at the risk of his life. The mate replied<br/>
that he would not ask a man to do a thing he was not<br/>
willing to do himself and forthwith attempted the task<br/>
At the same moment we shipped a sea which instantly</p>",
42658.0,147,,"<p>washed him overboard. The cry of second mate overboard immediately<br/>
rang through the ship and ropes were thrown out to him but he<br/>
could not get them. The buoy was next flung to him and he swam<br/>
hard to reach it but could not as the sea was running so high it<br/>
floated to the leeward of him. The captain then gave orders to ^bout^<br/>
<strike>the</strike> ship which was going 8 knotts an hour. This was done as spedily<br/>
as possible still it took several minutes to accomplish. The<br/>
Life boat was <strike>then</strike> ^let^ down at the same time and Harry the boatswain<br/>
and four other hands maned it. Notwithstanding the high seas<br/>
they managed the boat well. The second mate continued to swim<br/>
for 15 or twenty minutes in the raging billows even until the<br/>
Life boat was within a few rods of him when he instantly sunk<br/>
to rise no more. They remained on or near the spot where<br/>
he was last seen—both the ship and the boat—but nothing more was<br/>
seen of him. The boat then came along-side but it was with <br/>
great difficulty they put on board the ship and they came near being<br/>
swamped several times</p>

<p>After every exertion had been made they were<br/>
oblidg[ed] to trim the sails to the wind and continue their course<br/>
leaving the unfortunate mate in his watery grave. The Captain<br/>
and crew seemed much affected by the event.</p>

<p>The name of the second mate was [[William Drummond|William <br/>
Drummond]] an American native of <strike>floshing</strike> ^[[Flushing, New York City, Queens County, New York|Flushing]]^ Long Island New York<br/>
He was a single man had been in the East Indian trade with our<br/>
Captain [[William Howland|William Holland]]. This was his first trip in the Liverpool<br/>
trade and he was now on his return home. He was a stirring<br/>
ambitious young man and it was remarkable with what pleasure<br/>
the night before he spoke of taking tea with his mother on his arrval<br/>
home. But in the midst of his young ambitious hopeful<br/>
life he was suddenly in death burried in his watery grave</p>

<p>Harry the boatsman took the place <br/>
of the unfortunate secondmate and soon the ship's company<br/>
was sailing on as though nothing had happened. </p>",

<p>While on our voyage Elder [[Joseph Albert Stratton|Stratten]] related to me<br/>
the following narative</p>

<p><strike>I</strike> ^""^<strike>i</strike>In company with some friends on the 22nd of<br/>
October 1845 I went to visit a young maiden who was in a ^kind^ <br/>
^of^ trance. She was the daughter of [[James Comer|James]] and [[Susan Comer|Susan Corner]] ^Comer^<br/>
and her own name was [[Ann Comer|Ann <strike>Corner</strike>]] ^Commer^. Her parents lived at<br/>
the village of [[Farrington Gurney, Somerset, England|Farrington Gurney]] Sommersertshire England; and <br/>
the village is 12 miles from [[Bath, Somerset, England|Bath]] and 15 from [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]].<br/>
Ann was a sprightly child until the age of 12 years at<br/>
which time she was take[n] with convulsions and fits for five weeks<br/>
Her jaws became locked and eyes closed; she lost the use of her<br/>
limbs and was only able to turn her head and raise her hand a few<br/>
inches. The last article of food she was ever known to eat was<br/>
a small portion of an egg. This was upwards of eight years<br/>
ago during which time there has nothing entered her mouth<br/>
or passed from her. She breaths through her nose with<br/>
regular breathing and her pulse also beats regularly though<br/>
quite feble. She has grown about 2 inches in height during<br/>
this state looks very pleasant and has a smile upon her<br/>
countenance. It is the oppnion [opinion] of some that she is not<br/>
insensible and as incredible as the case may seem I could<br/>
not find a doubt among any one in the neighbourhood of the<br/>
correctness of the statement given me. I pressed her hand<br/>
several times and received a light pressure in return. Her<br/>
fingure nails have come off three times during the eight<br/>
years but at the present time they are perfect. Many<br/>
of the first Physicians in Bath have visited her and<br/>
some have spent three or four days at a time with her<br/>
They have desired to have her removed to the Hospital<br/>
but her parents will not alow it and as much as possible</p>",

[[John Hastings|Hastings]] and myself went to an eating house and got a <strike>bo</strike> ^dish^<br/>
of oysters which we relished very much after so long a trip and <br/>
the exhausted ship's fare; but we were more reconcilled to our<br/>
hard passage when we found that other ships had passed<br/>
quite as long and hard a voyage as ourselves that trys some of<br/>
them coming in dismasted and all had suffered much</p>

<p>Elder Stratton started for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and <br/>
I to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] my native place to take my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and<br/>
[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-mother]] with me to Nauvoo and thence to find a new<br/>
home with the Saints in their exodus to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]]<br/>
I reached Farmington on the 11th found all matters concerning<br/>
my father and mother <strike>as I</strike> ^according^ to my expectations but<br/>
my Aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna Cossett]] had died which broke up <strike>the</strike> ^her^<br/>
family. Her daughter [[Anna Cossett|Ann]] was going into a factory [[Cyrus Cossett|Cyrus]]<br/>
to [[Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|Canton]] in the blacksmith business which left my<br/>
cousin [[Betsey Cossett Alvord|Betsey]] alone and she desired to go with my<br/>
fathers family and the Saints</p>

<p>Leaving Farmington for a season I<br/>
started for my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife's]] [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father]]'s to fetch my daughter [[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe]]<br/>
whom I found a large fleshy girl.</p>

<p>I reached [[Saco, York County, Maine|Saco]] on the 17th and called<br/>
upon my wifes [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|sister]] whom I found in good health faith<br/>
and spirits and with her [[Phebe Carter Foss Sessions|Phebe]] her daughter and my child<br/>
Phebe whom I soon caught in my arms and kissed</p>",
42658.0,150,,"<p>I took dinner with my sister-in-law [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|^Sarah^<br/>
Foss]] and then went with her to Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]] in a wagon.<br/>
I found my wife's father well and the rest of the family excepting<br/>
[[Mary Fabyan Carter|Mary]] whom I thought had somewhat failed since I last saw<br/>
her. With my father-in-law and others of the family I spent the<br/>
night at his house. He told me that the spirit of [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|mother]]<br/>
<strike>did often at night visit him.</strike> ^visited him almost evey night.^</p>

<p>My wife had given me as her last request<br/>
that her father should be baptized and receive the Priesthood at<br/>
my hands before I left him and thus I communicated to<br/>
him. He said that he had desired at times to be baptized <br/>
and thought he would at this time if I stayed over another<br/>
day but next morning he was reluctant as the water<br/>
was frozen &amp;c so I thought it best to start on my journey<br/>
that day as I was so late in the season and our people had<br/>
to leave [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] that Spring</p>

<p>Father Carter was 73 years of age that<br/>
very day. Before I bade him farewell we visited together<br/>
mother's grave walking on the crust of snow that covered<br/>
the ground but her grave was bare. The old man<br/>
pointed to a spot beside it and said ""that place will<br/>
soon be my bed."" I took some pebbles from the grave<br/>
to carry to [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]].</p>

<p>At our parting our aged father<br/>
was much affected and wept. He sent his best parental<br/>
love to his daughter and wished me to say to her that he <br/>
was a firm beleive<strike>d</strike>r in the Book of Mormon and the<br/>
faith of the Latter-day Saints and that as soon as he saw<br/>
his way clear he would endeavour to be baptized</p>

to start on our journey to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. We took breakfast and bade<br/>
farewell to the town of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] and the inhabitants thereof<br/>

<p>It was a pleasant morning. We rode to <br/>
[[New Britain, Hartford County, Connecticut|New Britain]] in a waggon and when we were on the top<br/>
of the mountain I cast my eyes back upon my native place<br/>
I gave to it a final and probably my last adieu</p>

<p>We did not get to the station in season<br/>
for the passenger train so we took the baggage train to <br/>
[[New Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven]]. Here I found <strike>Elder</strike> ^Bro^ Adams from Springfield<br/>
and he went with me to the United States Riffle Factory<br/>
and I bought four riffles with extra barrels</p>

carriage six yoke of oxen six cows 4 calves one yearling and a pair<br/>
of mules making in all 25 head. I started to go to the Black Jack<br/>
Grove to Camp. The whole care was upon myself. As soon as we had<br/>
started the cows and calves all ran various ways and while I was trying<br/>
to get them together the oxen broke the tongue out of my carriage  After<br/>
that was mended by leaving part of our stock we got started but we had<br/>
not gone far before my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] drove into a mud hole and the oxen<br/>
mired down. We put on 8 yoke of oxen to draw the waggon<br/>
out but we could not and broke four chains in the attempt. We<br/>
had to dig the waggon out at last and finally got camped at Black<br/>
Jack Grove very weary though we had made ^but^ four miles.</p>

<p>I returned to Nauvoo on the morrow<br/>
<strike>and sold our prairie land for goods</strike> and next day crossed the river to Montrose<br/>
and had an interview  with a company of Saints from [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]<br/>
and among them was Brother [[Joseph Sidwell|Sidwell]] who gave to Brother Orson Hyde<br/>
seven hundred dollars for the Camp $100 for himself and $100 for me</p>

<p>I again returned to Nauvoo and arranged<br/>
some business. Here I saw [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother Woodruff]] my sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] and <br/>
her [[Dwight Webster|husband]] and [[Lucy Mack Smith|Mother Smith]] together and some unpleasant feelings<br/>
were manifested upon the subject of [[James Jesse Strang|Strang]] and his followers. I<br/>
parted with Eunice and her husband for the last time and again</p>",

<p>I rode to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] next day and got my goods. I had<br/>
to pay 100 dollars on my patent flouring mill and 70 for freightage. I returned<br/>
to the Camp where I spent the next day.</p>

<p><u>Adieu to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</u></p>

<p>I was in Nauvoo on <time datetime=""",05/22/1846
42658.0,157,1846-05-25,""">the 22<sup>nd</sup></time> for the last time and<br/>
left this city of the Saints feeling that most likely I was taking a final farewell<br/>
of it in this life. I looked upon the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and city as it receded<br/>
from me and I asked the Lord to ^remember^  <strike>preserve it as a monument of the</strike><br/>
sacrifices of His Saints.</p>

<p>I returned to Camp Painted my ^waggon covers^ and prepared for<br/>
my journey during the several following days and struck our tents on<br/>
<time datetime=""",05/25/1846
42658.0,157,1846-05-27,""">the 25th</time> and drove to [[Charleston Township, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Charlestown]] where we camped for the night. Here<br/>
I remained in Camp during the next day. <strike>as</strike> I had taken cold and<br/>
felt quite lame and had a few days before sprained my sholder and thumb<br/>
among the cattle. Brother [[Hiram Clark, b. 1795|H. Clark]] [[James Townsend|J Townsend]] and many others passed<br/>
us during the day and brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] came up and camped with us for<br/>
the night.</p>

<p><u>My [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] Nearly Killed</u></p>

<p>Just before we stoped to camp on <time datetime=""",05/27/1846
42658.0,157,,""">the 27</time> a serious accident<br/>
happened to my father. He went to get into the waggon while<br/>
the oxen were travelling and the foreboard which he had taken hold<br/>
of gave way. He fell instantly upon his back and  both wheels of the <br/>
waggon loaded with 25 <u>cwt</u> passed over his legs and arms and came<br/>
near passing over his head. I expected at first that it had killed<br/>
him but we soon found that it had not nor broken any bones though<br/>
it had badly brused his flesh.</p>

<p>We journeyed to [[Farmington, Van Buren County, Iowa Territory|Farmington]] next day. Here the <br/>
whole of the company bought their flour—I bought 4 barrels—and then we</p>",
42658.0,158,1846-06-07,"<p>crossed the [[Des Moines River, United States|Desmoin River]] at the [[Farmington, Van Buren County, Iowa Territory|Farmington]] Ferry and went four miles and<br/>
camped. We were now twenty five miles from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>We lay still through the next day and I reloaded<br/>
my <strike>teams</strike> ^waggon^ and sent back to Farmington for sundry articles. [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] was<br/>
quite lame but doing well considering how badly he was injured</p>

<p>Several days after we overtook the Ramus Company <br/>
of about 25 waggons and on the next I went to [[Bloomfield, Davis County, Iowa|Bloomfield]] and bought <br/>
two more yoke of cattle for which I paid $20 for one yoke and $30<br/>
for the other.</p>

42658.0,158,1846-06-15,"""> the 7th</time> we killed our last calf and<br/>
in the afternoon travelled till sundown when we came to a long<br/>
swail one mile and half across. This was the worse piece of road<br/>
we had passed. My carriage and family went through it and<br/>
I got my waggons half through by dark when the wheels of my<br/>
waggon cut to the hub in turf and mud and with 8 yoke of <br/>
cattle I could not get through and two of my waggons remained<br/>
in the swamp all night. My cousin [[Betsey Cossett Alvord|Betsey]] was in one of<br/>
then and remained all night. I was in the mud and water<br/>
up to my knees till 2 o'clock and among the cattle nearly all <br/>
night. At daylight I rolled myself up in a Buffaloo robe and <br/>
got some sleep and we rested through the day both man and <br/>
beast.</p>

<p>We travelled 20 miles next day and camped<br/>
near the Macedonia Company consisting of 31 waggons and travelled<br/>
with them through the following day an^d^ at night I called the<br/>
camp together and addressed them.</p>

<p>Next morning I started the company according<br/>
to our organization. We passed through a bad swail and my men broke<br/>
another tongue out of my waggon. We went to timber cut a stick and <br/>
put in a new one and camped for the day</p>

<p>We journeyed on for the next few days<br/>

families on the road and on the <time datetime=""",06/15/1846

and [[William Huntington, b. 1784|Huntington]] the President and Council at Mount Pisgah and many other<br/>
friends. I encamped on the east side of the creek and the Camp of<br/>
Israel. Here I learned that Brother [[Noah Rogers|Noah Rogers]] who had just returned from<br/>
a mission to the South Sea Islands was dead and the first person burried<br/>
in the burrying ground at Mount Pisgah. Bro [[Samuel Turnbow|Turnbow]] one of our company<br/>
also lost a child to day. I attended to its burrial on the morrow and<br/>
visited the encampment.</p>

<p>The day after I rode through the encampment<br/>
to buy a ton of flour to fit out my company. I rode thirty miles and <br/>
was sick at night and continued unwell next day but rode a good part of the<br/>
time. I went to see [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] who had been quite sick. I administered<br/>
to him and he was relieved</p>

<p>The following day I got home my flour. I bought<br/>
for myself 16 80 <u>lbs</u> at 3 cts per <u>lb</u> and also some for brother [[Simeon Blanchard|Blanchard]] and<br/>
[[Brother Sanders|Sanders]] and the next day I had a thorough overhauling of my loads and<br/>
repacking. I left a number of chests barrels &amp;c</p>

We had a good me<strike>t</strike>eting. Some assistance was called for to help me<br/>
off. Some money was donated and oxen and waggons promised</p>

<p>After meeting an express came from the<br/>
President at Council Bluffs requiring 100 mounted men as dragoons<br/>
for a guard and Buffalou Hunters for the Camp of Israel.</p>

<p>Next evening I met the people to raise<br/>
the 100 volunteers of mounted men and addressed the assembly on the<br/>
importance of complying with the request made and assisting the Twelve<br/>
and those associated with them to go to the Mountains and lift<br/>
up the Standard of Zion. I then called for the volunteers and<br/>
about 60 followed me out in the line. We appointed the next <br/>
evening to meet again at which time we met and afterwards wrote<br/>
to the President reporting what we had done in the matter.</p>",

into his business and he informed us that he was sent by order of <br/>
<strike>Capt</strike> Col [[Stephen W. Kearny|Kerney]] who had been instructed by President Polk to give<br/>
the Mormons an invitation to raise five hundred volunteers<br/>
to assist the United States in the [[Mexican-American War|Mexican War]]. We treated<br/>
the agent courteously and directed him on to [[Miller|Council Bluffs]] to lay<br/>
the matter before <strike>the</strike> President [[Brigham Young|Young]].</p>

<p>Next day I received a letter from<br/>
President Young and wrote him one and sent him a messenger before<br/>
the troops.</p>

<p>I was unwell on the Sunday yet I preached<br/>
to the Saints at [[Mount Pisgah, Union County, Iowa|Mount Pisgah]] and had an interview with Elder<br/>
[[William Clayton|Clayton]] and next day I gathered my company with their cattle<br/>
and waggons together and bid adieu to the friends at Mount <br/>
Pisgah and travelled on.</p>

six waggons one carriage sixteen yoke of oxen 7 cows 2 mules and <br/>
one horse in all 42 head</p>

<p>After we had completed building a new bridge<br/>
over the creek <strike>by</strike> ^when^ we camped at the end of our first days journey<br/>

42658.0,161,,""">the 1st of July</time> we were<br/>
visited by Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] who was direct from [[Miller|Council Bluffs]] and was<br/>
a Messenger to all the Camp of Isreal. I formed a circle of about 50 waggons<br/>
and he delivered his errand. He was sent to raise a company of<br/>
men as pioneers to go immediately to the mountains without their families<br/>
to pick out a location and put in Spring and fall crops. The quorum of<br/>
the Twelve had volunteered to go</p>

<p>After we got our message I drove ahead as fast as<br/>
possible with my teams. We travelled 20 miles with our ox waggons<br/>
and camped at about 10 o'clock at night man and beast wearied out.</p>

<p>Next day we journeyed till 7 o'clock at night<br/>
and on the following one was overtaken by Brother Parley returning in <br/>
company with Brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] who had been nominated to fill the place<br/>
and wear the crown of [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]].</p>

<p>Brothers Pratt and Benson wished me to <strike>return</strike><br/>
accompany them to the Bluffs so I saddled my horse and started with<br/>
them.</p>

<p>It was interesting to be once more with brother Parley<br/>
and to add to the interest of our day's ride we passed through the<br/>
main village of the Pottawatamie Indians. This was the first<br/>
time in my life I had ever passed through a large villiage of<br/>
Indians.</p>

<p>After viewing the Indians and their village<br/>
awhile we continued our journey and rode until dark then<br/>
unsaddled our horses and made our bed in the grass on<br/>
the side of the hill but the musketoes soon routed us out<br/>
We had to go to the top of the hill where we again laid<br/>
down and spent the night in the wind and in the morning<br/>
I felt quite stiff and sore.</p>",

with some brethren and as we had no supper the night before our appetites<br/>
were good. Here we were informed that President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] were but a short distance<br/>
from us encamped and were on their way to [[Mount Pisgah, Union County, Iowa|Mount Pisgah]]. We<br/>
immediately rode down to them and it was truly a happy meeting<br/>
and I rejoiced once more to st[r]ike hands with these noble men for<br/>
it was the first time we had met since I left [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] on my<br/>
mission to [[England|England]] in 1844 soon after the martyrdom of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and<br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]</p>

<p>Brother Brigham and his companions Heber<br/>
and Willard insisted that I should return with them so brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]]<br/>
myself and several of the Life guard returned until I met my family<br/>
and company and I had the privilege of introducing to the brethren<br/>
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and others. After spending a little time together they<br/>
continued their journey to Mount Pisgah to raise the five hundred<br/>
volunteers for the service of the United States. I tarried with<br/>
my family. I had ridden about 50 miles already that day and<br/>
was exceedingly sore and stiff and almost sick.</p>

<p>The Sunday followed and we continued <br/>
to journey slowly through the day and on the next evening we<br/>
camped at the same place where I had camped with [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley]] in<br/>
the grass. An Indian Chief camped near us with some<br/>
squaws. The Indian said he was going to meet with Mormons<br/>
and smoke the pipe of peace.</p>

<p>Early next morning some 50 Indians<br/>
said to belong to the Sioux passed our camp for the east.<br/>
They said they were going to meet the Mormon Chief. We <br/>
supposed they ment President Young who had gone to Mount<br/>
Pisgah. They were noble looking Indians</p>

<p>We laid by this day to let our cattle<br/>
rest. I was called upon to administer the ordinance of the Church</p>",

children were born unto Israel in the wilderness and by the way side as in the<br/>
days of old</p>

<p>Next morning we continued our journey and came <br/>
along side of the General encampment at [[Miller|Council Bluffs]] at about noon.<br/>
I saw the encampment of some of the Twelve and had an interview with<br/>
Elders [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and many other friends.</p>

<p>I pitched my tent and camp on a bluff near <br/>
Elders Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor. It rained hard at night.</p>

<p>In the evening we held a council about raising<br/>
the 500 volunteers for the President of the United States to go to Upper<br/>
California and for the [[Mexican-American War|Mexican war]]</p>

<p>I spent <time datetime=""",07/11/1846

the Volunteers. We had a visit from Col. Kane from the city of<br/>
[[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] confirming the declaration that President Polk had sent <br/>
for five hundred Mormon Volunteers. He informed us that the<br/>
President was very favourable to our people and that he had taken this<br/>
course for our good. Col. Kane manifested the spirit of a gentleman<br/>
and much interest in our welfare.</p>

<p>From the information received from <br/>
<strike>Col. Kane</strike> ^him represented^ we were convinced that God had begun to move upon the<br/>
heart of the President and others of the nation to act for our interest and<br/>
the general good of Zion. The object of Presedent [[James Knox Polk|Polk]] was to enlist<br/>
500 of the Latter-day Saints and feed cloth[e] and pay them and<br/>
let them go direct to [[California|California]] via [[Santa Fe, Mexican Cession Territory|Santa Fe]] and take possession<br/>
of that country and prepare a way for the body of the Church<br/>
to come which would make them the first settlers of that<br/>
country.</p>

south of the chime ridge or Redemption Hill and mine on the north</p>",

We built a bowery between Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor's]] ten and my own and a large<br/>
assembly of the Saints met at an early hour the first Sunday after<br/>
I arrived at [[Miller|Council Bluffs]]. I was called upon to address them<br/>
and give an account of my travels through [[England|England]] [[Scotland|Scotland]] [[Wales|Wales]]<br/>
which I did for about the space of an hour. Parley P. Pratt and<br/>
John Taylor and others followed particularly taking up the subject<br/>
of the volunteers for the United States and the expedition to California</p>

<p>On the following day also the Twelve<br/>
met in council and then a general meeting of the Camp of <br/>
Israel was called when three companies of one hundred each<br/>
volunteered for the California service. Several measures were<br/>
entered into by the Twelve. At the close of the business of<br/>

some felt so well they danced.</p>

hollow square by their Captains and then addressed by several of the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve in a very suitable manner</p>

<p><u>The</u> <u>March</u></p>

<p>At the close of the address the Battalion commenced<br/>
its march in double file from Redemption Hill for seven miles<br/>
across the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] Bottom to the Ferry. The brethren<br/>
who formed these companies had left their families teams and waggons<br/>
and cattle standing by the way side not expecting to meet them again<br/>
for one or two years. Yes here by the way side they left their<br/>
wives and children to the mercy of God and their brethren but they<br/>
went away with cheerful hearts beleving they were thus doing the will<br/>
of God. As I viewed them I considered that I was looking<br/>
upon the first Battalion of the army of Israel engaged in the service<br/>
of the United States.</p>

20 volunteered. Ninety men were also appointed to act as Bishops<br/>
to take charge ^of the famlies^ of those who had volunteered for the Californian<br/>
service.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting in company with<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] the Twelve and others we left Redemption Hill<br/>
[[Miller|Council Bluffs]] and rode 5 miles to the French and Indian Village<br/>
and Mills. We then took the Indian trail across the ridges bluffs<br/>
hills and dales on the road that Emmit travelled to [[Big Pigeon Creek, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|big Pigeon]]. Here<br/>
we camped for the night with some of the Saints who had arrived<br/>
two hours before us. This was the first Mormon camp on the<br/>
Big Pigeon</p>

went to examine the Big Pigeon which I found well supplied with good<br/>
fish. I returned to the waggons and then with the Twelve to Redemption<br/>
Hill but a company of six men crossed the Big Pigeon to explore<br/>

tying their heads to the boat and rowing them over. We took over <br/>
twenty thus and also some oxen and as we had not enough men I took<br/>
one of the oars myself and assisted in ferrying in the hot sun and<br/>
then drove teams up the hills through the mud and when I got<br/>
through my days work I felt hardly able to stand up and nex[t]<br/>
day we were all unwell in consequence of fatigue</p>

<p>I continued unwell also on the following<br/>
day but attended a council of the Twelve and dined with Dr<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richurds]]</p>

<p>Suddenly a thunderstorm struck us.<br/>
The water beat through our waggon covers and the wind drove our<br/>
family carriage down a steep hill turned it bottom side upward<br/>
and smashed the top to pieces but providentially there was<br/>
no one in it and everything was saved ^that was in the carriage medicine bottles and all^ <strike>but the bottles in the carriage</strike> <br/>
Very heavy thunderstorms continued during the night and the beds<br/>
bedding and family was drenched and several tents in the camp<br/>
torn down</p>

<p>The council of the Twelve met on this Sunday afternoon<br/>
and decided that Winter Quarters of the Camp of Israel should<br/>
be located near where we then were</p>

<p>A messenger had just arrived from the<br/>
Mormon Battalion within 30 miles of [[Fort Leavenworth, Leavenworth County, Kansas Territory|Fort Leavenworth]]. He gave<br/>
a good report of the brethren who were all well and doing<br/>
honour to the cause</p>

<p>During the evening President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
and Dr Richards called at my tent and President Young addressed<br/>
us upon the Priesthood and the principle of sealing. <strike>There</strike></p>",

[[Mary Ann Jackson Woodruff Ross|Mary Jackson]].</strike></p>

<p>I was now surrounded by two or three hundred<br/>
waggons belonging to the Camp of Israel but I had been so busy in our<br/>
journying caring for cattle &amp;c and so few men to assist according to the<br/>
amount of labour that I had not been able to devote so much time<br/>
to my Journals necessary to do them justice in keeping a record of the<br/>
exodus from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] of this great people and their travels in the<br/>
wilderness towards the Mountains</p>

<p>On <time datetime=""",08/03/1846

me and his horse ran into my tent tore it badly to pieces<br/>

<p>Next day I travelled with President [[Brigham Young|Young's]]<br/>
company 9 miles and camped on a prairie ridge near the timber<br/>
and on the following one rode with the Twelve and others to<br/>
view the timber and find a place of encampment and on<br/>

we rode out and enjoyed a pleasant day</p>

<p>We held a public meeting in the Camp of Israel<br/>
on this day and chose twelve men as a High and<br/>
City Council to transact all business appertaining to the<br/>
settlement during the winter</p>

<p>We also held a consultation with<br/>
Col. Kane and some important things were said and<br/>
a resolution formed to address certain resolutions to<br/>
President [[James Knox Polk|Polk]] expressive of our gratitude for his kindness<br/>
to the Latter-day Saints in his design of arming and<br/>

to make him</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] informed Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]] that our<br/>
intention was to settle in the Great Basin or Bear Valley and<br/>
that a Territorial Government would be petitioned for as soon as<br/>
we got settled.</p>

<p>We rode out in the evening and pitched<br/>
upon a location in a valley the east side of the timber.</p>

<p>On the Sunday a large congregation of<br/>
the Saints assembled in their new meeting place in the valley<br/>
sellected for Winter Quarters. The Stand and seats sufficient<br/>
to hold about 300 were made the evening before. I was called<br/>
upon to address the congregation which I did about an hour<br/>
and was followed by several of the Elders and then President<br/>
Young closed with an interesting address. He said he<br/>
did not expect to see the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]] that year but when<br/>
the Lord commanded him to go direct he intended to go if he<br/>
left all and went alone but thought the Lord would let him<br/>
take the People with him. When he found the place for<br/>
the Temple he would work hard until it was built.</p>

<p>In the evening I met in council with Presidents<br/>
Young [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and others until about <strike>12</strike>midnight and<br/>
we drew up a plan of the encampment.</p>

<p>Next day my company and I was<br/>
engaged in building a fence around my encampment and I also<br/>
met with the High Council</p>

<p>We formed a hollow square with an L<br/>
of about 350 waggons in encampment No 1, and then built a strong fence<br/>
as an enclosure of the whole. The fence was built five rods from<br/>
the waggons and the waggons were placed mouth fronting the Square<br/>
The encampment made a fine appearence and we had a busy<br/>
day in setting it in order.</p>

<p>Next day was a busy day for me and my<br/>
company in building a fence for our cattle and looking them up. I also<br/>
met in council with the Twelve and we had a public meeting in<br/>
Encampment No 1 when the encampment was devided into eleven divisions<br/>

Spring and they shot their pointed arrows to divert us. At the<br/>

<p>I met with the Twelve and High Council with two<br/>
tribes of Indians. The object was to get permission to stay<br/>
on the land that season and to use wood grass and water for<br/>
two or three years or as long as we wished while gathering to the<br/>
mountains.</p>

<p>We first met with the Otoes between whom<br/>
and the Omahas there was a dispute as to who owned the land<br/>

or six others were present. We talked to him and <br/>
he went home.</p>",

chief's name was Big Elk and his son a young chief called Young Elk. There<br/>
were also present about 60 old men and braves of the tribe. As it was late<br/>
the Council was adjourned until the morrow. We then met in<br/>
council among ourselves and did some business and among other things<br/>
appointed 3 men to buy up the cattle and sell beef. They were<br/>

<p>We met in the morning with the Omahas chiefs and<br/>
braves in Council. We smoked the pipe of peace and then<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] spoke to them through their interpreter. He told<br/>
them it was our desire to winter there and that if they wished we<br/>
would do some work for them—make them a field fix their<br/>
guns &amp;c and said many other things which I did not report.<br/>

<p>""My Son, Thou hast spoken well. I have<br/>
all thou hast said in my heart. I have much I want to say<br/>
We are poor. When we go to hunt game in one place we meet an<br/>
enemy, and so in another place. Our enemies kill us. We do not<br/>
kill them. I hope we will be friends. You may stay on these<br/>
lands two years or more. Our young men may watch your<br/>
cattle. We would be glad to have you trade with us. We will<br/>
warn you <strike>from</strike>^of^ danger from other Indians.""</p>

<p>Much more was said by Big Elk. The<br/>
Council closed and the Indians were fed and returned home.</p>

42658.0,176,1846-09-01,"<p>excepting that I suffered from caker in the mouth. We rode over hill and dale<br/>
about 25 miles and camped 12 miles above the Bluffs</p>

had to build a bridge before we could cross. The Indian trail went up<br/>
the Bluff which was the road to be taken but as we <strike>did</strike>had no guide<br/>
we kept the table land under the bluff.</p>

<p>We passed through a flat about two miles<br/>
across covered with pea vines grass weeds and cane from five to ten<br/>
feet high. We had to wallow through with<strike>out</strike> ^our^ horses an<br/>
waggons. Four of us finally climbed the bluff and traced the trail<br/>
back to the bridge we made and then returned to the horsemen and<br/>
waggons. There were 10 of the former and three of the latter.</p>

<p>We came to another creek which we had to<br/>
bridge and after crossing it on to another flat of about 600 acres<br/>
and here we found Council Bluffs <strike>at</strike> ^near^ sundown</p>

<p>There was nothing standing of the old Barracks<br/>
except the body of the Magazine with one gable end made of<br/>
brick arched over. We walked to the edge of the bluff. Before<br/>
us on the bottom appeared a small grove of willows beyond it a small<br/>
stream of muddy water and in the distance a dense mass of Cottonwood<br/>
and Willow. I started up a deer a few rods of me <br/>
and we tried to get a shot at him but could not. A wolf also went<br/>
into the forest before us.</p>

<p><strike>W</strike> After looking about the premises of the<br/>
old Council Bluffs about an hour and seeing nothing inviting<br/>
we started on our return and after travelling about a mile<br/>

but lost him. There were signs of deer and elk very</p>",

the Twelve and High Council and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] wass called upon to report the<br/>

<p><u>Discourse of President [[Brigham Young|Young]]</u></p>

<p>Afterwards President Young arose and said:</p>

<p>""I wish to say a few words upon principle<br/>
I desire the brethren and sisters to be taught in all things necessary<br/>
There is one thing I want you to realize and that is that God<br/>
angels and Saints—heaven and all of Gods creations are governed<br/>
by law. And I want the Camp of Israel to understand<br/>
that we must be. If Heaven was not controlled by law<br/>
what sort of a place would it be? I would not wish to be there<br/>
for where we rushed into heaven without law every man would<br/>
be in danger of loosing his rights and having them trampled<br/>
upon. But all celestial beings are governed by law and<br/>
order for the celestial law is a perfect order of things—a<br/>
perfect system of light law intelligence exaltation and glory<br/>
where every person's right's are sustained to the fullest extent</p>",
42658.0,179,,"<p>But we do not arrive at this at once. As an Apostle said we have precept<br/>
upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little until we<br/>
arrive at a fulness of knowledge and glory even that fulness which<br/>
reigns in the heavens</p>

<p>We must begin to be governed by law here<br/>
before we are prepared to receive the fulness that reigns in Heaven.<br/>
The whole law has not been given and you cannot abide the whole as<br/>
yet. If it had all been given we should all have been smashed<br/>
up and destroyed. A people must become acquainted thoroughly <br/>
with law before they can abide it; but the time has come when<br/>
we must have law and order in our midst</p>

<p>There has been some feelings of late in the<br/>
Camp because some unruly boys have been floged by the Marshall<br/>
for their wickedness; but if this Camp is not willing to let law<br/>
and order reign here and put a stop to such wickedness I wish<br/>
you to let me know it and I will go away from you for those<br/>
who wish to sustain crime and corruption let them return and<br/>
strike hands with the mob and carry out their principles and be<br/>
damned. But if you want to do right say so. This people<br/>
have been driven here for their desires to do righteousness and<br/>
this wickedness shall be put a stop to that has been manifest in<br/>
the camp by certain young people of late. Yes it will be<br/>
stopped if God comes out and smites it by judgement. The<br/>
Marshall did not whip them hard enough or they would not<br/>
have spit out their revenge but it would have been whipped<br/>
out of them. If I am drove to the necessity of whipping<br/>
a person in such a case they will not spit out revenge afterwards<br/>
for I will whip it out of them.</p>

<p>Shall we any longer sustain in our midst<br/>
men who will carry out the principles of [[John Cook Bennett|John C. Bennett]] and<br/>
other corrupt scoundrils? No: <strike>I will sware by the Eternal<br/>
God of Heaven that</strike> such conduct shall be stopped and shall<br/>
not be permitted in this Camp for if they continue it I will</p>",
42658.0,180,,"<p>tell the Marshall what the law is and they shall be taken care off<br/>
in a manner that they will not whine and [[Brigham Young|I]] will whip any man<br/>
who will sustain it. And I prophesy in the name of God<br/>
that such a man whether old or young shall be bowed down with<br/>
sorrow and mourning even more than this people have. Then<br/>
stop before you further go and not sport upon the brink of<br/>
sorrow and mourning. This people have the law of liberty<br/>
and the Gospel and the more the light and liberty and greater<br/>
the privileges the stricter the law. We are going into the<br/>
wilderness and shall we suffer such things? No: <strike>I sware by<br/>
the Eternal God</strike> such things shall not be while Brigham<br/>
lives.</p>

<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] gave a good shot<br/>
when he said that no man would run into his waggon and<br/>
sware that he would shoot the Marshall if he came after him<br/>
except he was guilty of crime. No man is a<strike>f</strike>fraid except<br/>
he is guilty. No man need be a<strike>f</strike>fraid who does right<br/>
I defy the world to say that I have taken away ^any^ man's right^s^ but<br/>
after we have been driven into the wilderness we are still followed<br/>
by men who sware that they will steal what they get in our<br/>

<p>Some young Elders who never preached<br/>
a sermon in their lives are a<strike>f</strike>faid that I shall have more <br/>
blessings than they or more wives or something or other but let<br/>
them go and preach the world over as I have in poverty and<br/>
distress with blood in my shoes and spent years and years<br/>
at it and left my wife and children who have also suffered much,<br/>
let them do as we have done and they will not be jealous of me<br/>
about blessings. If the Lord should give me a thousand<br/>
woman is it any man's business. No. Let such go and<br/>
spend as much time as I have and there will be many <br/>
clinging on to their skirts to be saved</p>

<p>The majority of the men of the Gentile</p>",
42658.0,181,1846-09-23,"<p>world will be damned and the women wish<strike>ed</strike> to be saved by going with good men<br/>
A woman that has the Spirit of God will go with a good man who has been faithful<br/>
and spent much time in saving mankind and who has the Priesthood. Such men if<br/>
they continue faithful will be saved in eternal glory and those who are with them</p>

<p>I am determined that my affections shall be with<br/>
God. I will not alow them to be placed on things that perish. When plagues<br/>
and disease get hold of our bodies we become loathsome and beautey fades away<br/>
but our affections should be placed upon things that are noble exalted lasting<br/>
and glorious. I love an exalted mind for it is eternal and cannot<br/>
fade. I want all my affections to be subject to God and glory and<br/>
eternal life. May God bless you: Amen.</p>

<p>Removal Of the Camp of Israel<br/>
<time datetime=""",09/23/1846
42658.0,181,1846-09-25,""">September the 23</time>rd</p>

<p>On this day we removed our encampment from the<br/>
prairie ridge to the table land on the bank of the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]]<br/>
This was a beautiful place for a city and we laid our city out in blocks<br/>
of 20 rods by 40 each lot 4 by 10. I had one block for my<br/>
company which consisted of nearly 40 families so I had to put two<br/>
families on a ^lot^ <strike>block</strike>. It was a very busy day and as we had no<br/>
yard we lost many of our cattle at night and I was hunting cattle<br/>
all the next day while most of my division drew poles and made a <br/>
fence to keep our cattle in.</p>

<p>Arrival of [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]]<br/>
To the Camp of Israel<br/>
<time datetime=""",09/25/1846
42658.0,181,,""">Sep. the 25</time></p>

<p>[[Squire Wells|Squire Wells]] arrived in Camp to day and also Brother<br/>
[[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]]. They were both direct from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. I sat about one</p>",
42658.0,182,1846-09-27,"<p>hour and heard them relate the State of affairs in that [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]]. The mob of<br/>
[[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]] and the State of [[Illinois|Illinois]] had swelled to over one thousand<br/>
men and had come upon Nauvoo and one hundred of the brethren<br/>
had kep[t] them off three days then had a pitched battle of one hour<br/>
and twenty minutes and drove the mob off the ground. The loss<br/>
of the brethren was 3 killed but that of the mob was not known</p>

<p>The morning of <time datetime=""",09/27/1846
42658.0,182,,""">Sunday the 27</time> we spent hearing<br/>
read a Missourian paper giving an account of the battle between<br/>
the mob and the Mormons of Nauvoo; also of General [[Stephen W. Kearny|Karney's]]<br/>
army of the West among whom was the Mormon Battalion. There<br/>
was a prospect of the whole army suffering for want of food.</p>

<p>We appointed a meeting to be held at 2 o'clock<br/>
in our new city to hear a statement from [[Squire Wells|Squire Wells]] of the<br/>
affairs in Nauvoo. Before the meeting there was heard the<br/>
cry of fire on the prairie grass of the encampment. All ran<br/>
to put it out and it was soon extinguished</p>

<p>Meeting opened at 2 o'clock at the Council Block<br/>
by prayer from [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] who also made some remarks upon<br/>
the subject of the time and he was then followed by Squire Wells who<br/>
gave to the assembly</p>

<p>A Narrative of the Battle Between the Mormons of<br/>
Nauvoo and the Mob</p>

<p>He said: ""I will by request give a short account of<br/>
affairs in Nauvoo concerning their late difficulties. You have heard <br/>
that men were lynched there. We took 15 of the offenders who were sent<br/>
to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] for a trial and they were let out on bail. The mob then<br/>
issued writs against [[William Pickett|Pic<strike>b</strike>^k^et^t^]] [[Benjamin Clifford Jr.|Clifford]] and [[James E. Furness|Furnice]]. The two latter<br/>
went; Pic<strike>b</strike>^k^et^t^ would not. A mob was then raised as a <u>possee</u><br/>
to execute the writs they said. They stayed several weeks to<br/>
increase their numbers. They had at first about 300 and increased<br/>
to a thousand. The hundred men we had laid in ambush</p>",
42658.0,183,,"<p>for the mob. ^who^ <strike>They</strike> cannonaded through the day but did no harm. Next day<br/>
they tried the same thing again. We repelled them</p>

<p>On Saturday at 1 o'clock they advanced upon the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]]<br/>
with from a thousand to twelve hundred men. We met them in the name<br/>
of God and gained the victory. The action lasted one hour and twenty minutes<br/>
They fired 42 cannon balls and we 32 balls. Although the mob were<br/>
ten to our one they were defeated and retreated from the battlefield. We<br/>
had three killed and <strike>none</strike> ^2^ wounded. The mob would not acknowledge any<br/>
killed but we walked over the battlefield and found a plenty of mob blood<br/>
One man not a member of the Church said he saw them put 15 bodies in<br/>
one waggon and they were handled like dead ^hogs^ and other waggons were<br/>
loaded in the same way. One of the Saints lying in a cellar saw<br/>
8 wounded brought to the building each one telling where he was shot<br/>
They dug at their entrenchment after the battle. It was supposed<br/>
they buried their dead there.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. They did<br/>
not fire any but we threw some ball and burst one cannon</p>

<p>On Monday the mob sent us a cannon<br/>
ball to let us know they had some left and we sent it back again<br/>
During the fight the boys would watch the cannon ball strike and<br/>
run and get it and bring it to us and we would send it back<br/>
again.</p>

<p>On Tuesday a committee was sent to<br/>
us to make a treaty but it was rejected by both parties. A Brigade<br/>
was then called for but afterwards a treaty was made. We agreed<br/>
to surrender the city and leave in five days</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening the treaty was made<br/>
<strike>and the Saints</strike> and the Saints began to pack up their goods and the next day<br/>
all goods was removed. As the mob came in we left two blocks<br/>
in advance</p>

<p>We met many of the Saints on this side of the<br/>
river in distress and it drew tears ^even^ from the eyes of some of the mob<br/>
We saw campfires of the mob the same night we left on both</p>",
42658.0,184,,"<p>sides of the river.</p>

<p>There were scenes transpired in the seige enough to melt<br/>
the heart of a stone. The lynching of men when they are labouring for<br/>
a living and whipping them until they cannot stand alone as the mob<br/>
did was a damnable thing. They made them kneel on a spot where<br/>
they said some one was buried and placed them in a position so they<br/>
could be whipped easy. An old Revolutioneer was one of them<br/>
and he was so beaten by the mob that he has not been able to get<br/>
about all summer. I have an old grandfather—a Revolutioneer<br/>
I have thought I would not let him know anything about it but<br/>
keep it from him that his feelings might not be harrowed up as<br/>
he is about ready to sleep in his grave. But I will say no<br/>
more but give way for brother [[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]]</p>

<p>Brother Cutler said:</p>

<p>I can bear my testimony that<br/>
what brother [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] has said is strictly true. If I were to talk<br/>
till sundown the whole could not be told. I have been kept<br/>
in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] by the hand of God. Others wanted to have been<br/>
here and would have been had it not been necessary to stop to<br/>
save our brethren there who could not get away. I know the hand<br/>
of God has been manifest in the salvation of the people in Nauvoo<br/>
I thank God I had a hand in the battle. And the hand of God was<br/>
so visible in that battle that many who were weak and faltering have been<br/>
much strengthened by it and will gather with the Saints. I did not expect<br/>
that God would deliver their enem<strike>y</strike>ies into their hands but expected that<br/>
He would save them out of the hands of their enemies and this he had<br/>
done.</p>

<p>I was sensible we must leave Nauvoo. The time<br/>
had come for us to depart. God has called upon us to go and if we<br/>
will not he will let the mob loose upon us to drive us out but they<br/>
will not get any glory for it but will have to suffer for their wrongs<br/>
to the Saints.</p>

<p>I hope the day will come when we shall not</p>",
42658.0,185,,"<p>have to suffer from mobs but if we had sought to save our lives in this case<br/>
by fleeing many would have lost them for but few could have fled; but we<br/>
went out in the name of God and conquered. Through the blessing of God we have<br/>
done well. One brother put on a sheep bell and went near the camp to<br/>
spy out the enemy and they supposed it to be a sheep. The mob do not<br/>
acknowledge having any killed but they had a good deal of blood spilled there<br/>
they could not cover up which I saw. Captain Smith who was captain<br/>
of the guard at the time of the death of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] was shot in the neck but<br/>
not killed. Another commander of the mob was also shot. Bro [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]]<br/>
has done well in all places where he has been put in the midst of danger<br/>
as well as in safety. With regard to the citizens of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] there<br/>
were but few who stood by us in time of trouble. There are many<br/>
spirits in Nauvoo who are like bats ready to join any party that<br/>
conquer. If the beast conquer they will show their legs, if <br/>
the feathered tribe their wings.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] arose and said</p>

<p>I wish to make a few remarks<br/>
attached to those which have been made. I will inform the brethren<br/>
who have come up <strike>that we are</strike> that we are glad to see them. Brother<br/>
[[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]] has been with us before. Brother Wells has been in our society<br/>
for several years and I have had considerable acquaintance with<br/>
him and I am more than ever satisfied with his course. We have<br/>
prayed for our brethren continually. I am sensible that there is<br/>
a good deal of suffering there and here but let me say that the Lord God<br/>
who has fed us all the day long has His care still over us. When the<br/>
Saints are chastized enough it will cease. At least the hand of God<br/>
will be visible in their salvation. Some individuals may fall but<br/>
the body will be sustained. I have never believed the Lord would<br/>
suffer a general massacre of this people by a mob. If ten<br/>
thousand men were to come against us if no other way was open the<br/>
earth would open and swallow them up. Some say they can stay<br/>
in Nauvoo and can live there in perfect peace they ar so righteous</p>",
42658.0,186,1846-10-15,"<p>There are some who have no better eyes than to say let me live with the<br/>
wicked in peace, but the<strike>re</strike>ir blessings will be scarce with the mob and<br/>
if they do not leave I fear they will prove a <strike>source</strike> ^scourge^ in the hands of<br/>
God. He works with the wicked by law and when they trespass<br/>
upon his rights God is there to maintain them</p>

<p>Many other remarks were made by<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]].</p>

<p>On the Sunday following during the<br/>
intermission of meeting [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] and myself<br/>
laid out the city of the camp of Israel named [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]]<br/>
into thirteen Wards and appointed a Bishop over each Ward. We<br/>
ordained six Bishops</p>

<p>On the Monday we stated on a grapeing<br/>
expedition. I took five women in my carriage to pick grapes<br/>
On our way we shot three prairie chicken got refreshments at Br<br/>
[[James Allred|J. Alred]] cut a road half a mile for my carriage and got on to<br/>
the grape ground at dark a distance of 20 miles</p>

<p>At daylight we arose breakfast on<br/>
Prairie chicken stew went on to the grape ground and found the grapes<br/>
on cottonwoods and willows. I cut down several hundred of them<br/>
about the size of my arm and some larger and at sundown we<br/>
had picked three barrels of bunch grapes and started home by moon-<br/>
light arrived at the camp of Israel quite weary next day and pressed<br/>
out about 20 gallons of juice for wine</p>

<p>Another Of My Serious Accidents</p>

<p>Nearly two weeks later <time datetime=""",10/15/1846
42658.0,186,,""">October the 15</time>th I took my<br/>
axe and went into the wood to cut some board-timber with two<br/>
of the brethren. While falling the third tree I steped back<br/>
from it several feet but when it fell it shot back of the<br/>
stump and bounded and struck me in the breast and knocked<br/>
^me^ several feet into the air against a standing oak and the falling</p>",
42658.0,187,1846-11-04,"<p>tree caught me against it and I came down crushed between the two trees.<br/>
My left thigh and hip were badly brused &amp; my left arm; my breast bone broken<br/>
into about 6 inches and three of my ribs of my left side broken and my lungs<br/>
and vitals bruised</p>

<p>After the accident I sat down upon a log and<br/>
waited until Brother [[John Garrison|John Garrison]] went a quarter of a mile to get my horse<br/>
Notwithstanding I was so badly hurt I had to mount my horse and ride<br/>
two and half miles over a rough road and my bones being so much broken<br/>
every step went through me like an arrow. I rode to [[Turkey Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turkey Creek]] and was<br/>
exhausted and was there taken off and carried in a chair home. Elders<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]] and others met me in the street and assisted<br/>
me home where I was laid upon my bed exhausted. Here I <br/>
laid without being able to move much until my bones knit together<br/>
and they began to knit on the 9th day but I was not able to<br/>
sit up in my bed until the 1st of November.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",11/04/1846
42658.0,187,1846-11-12,""">4</time>th I was helped out of my waggon and<br/>
with the assistance of two persons I was enabled to walk to my tent<br/>
and to Sister [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Benbows]] waggon where she laid very sick. On this day<br/>
our little son [[Joseph Woodruff|Joseph]] was taken sick ^and^</p>

<p>My Son Joseph Died.</p>

<p>As I grew convalescent <strike>b</strike>our little son declined. He<br/>
suffered much from convulsions during his sickness and breathed<br/>
his last 15 minutes before six o'clock in the morning and we took<br/>
his remains to the grave at 4 in the afternoon. His loss was<br/>
a great sacrifice to us</p>

<p>I began to labour once more on the <time datetime=""",11/17/1846
42658.0,187,,""">17</time>th<br/>
and during the next two weeks was overwhelmed in business which<br/>
was the case with the whole Camp of Israel</p>

<p>I had never seen the Latter-day Saints in<br/>
any situation where they seemed to be passing through greater tribulations</p>",
42658.0,188,1846-12-03,"<p>or wearing out faster than at the present time. After being exposed<br/>
to the sufferings of a tedious journey of 10 months in tents and waggons<br/>
without houses we were now oblige to build a city of log houses<br/>
numbering more than one thousand for the purpose of stopping<br/>
in for about three months. We also had to go a great distance<br/>
for wood and timber and get it out of deep ravines and<br/>
hollows which made it very hard to endure. I was<br/>
trying to build a log house for myself and one for my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]<br/>
and this on the first days of my labour after my serious<br/>
accident and broken bones.</p>

<p>Death of Sister [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Benbow]]</p>

<p>It will be remembered that brother [[John Benbow|Benbow]] <strike>who was<br/>
a respectable farmer</strike> was the first fruits of my extraordinary<br/>
mission in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] and one of my chief helpers. Sister<br/>
Benbow had also ministered to my wants and the wants of<br/>
my brethren the Twelve in a foreign land and had<br/>
done much good. Her husband and her had helped<br/>
the Saints to gather <strike>a</strike>had gathered with them and had shared<br/>
our privations and hardships in the wilderness which<br/>
were ended to her by death on the 27th of November<br/>

<p>On this day the main body of the warriors<br/>
belonging to the Omaha nation were out on a hunting party and<br/>
were surrounded by a party of the Sioux and sixty of the<br/>
Omahas were killed. This was a great loss to the Omaha<br/>
nation among whom in consequence there was great mourning<br/>
and wailing</p>

<p>The Camp of Israel was now devided into streets<br/>
blocks and Wards and a Bishop over each to see to the poor and the widows<br/>
and to keep an account of what each man was doing. The Twelve High<br/>
Council and Bishops met each week to do business and to manage the affairs<br/>
of the Church and instruct the Saints in each Ward</p>

<p>There was begining to be murmurings throughout<br/>
the Camp of Israel at this time and much wickedness that the Lord was<br/>
not pleased with. The Saints appeared like the children of Israel in the<br/>
Wilderness and the Nephites on this continent who at times would forget ^their^ God<br/>
and turn to wickedness. And while in council on the evening of the <time datetime=""",12/15/1846
42658.0,189,,""">15th<br/>
of December</time> the High Council asked President [[Brigham Young|Young]] for some teaching and<br/>
he arose and said that he had no teaching to give at present but to cry<br/>
repentance to the people and he would begin with the High Council<br/>
They must repent he said and the Camp of Israel must repent or the<br/>
Twelve would have to flee out of their midst and go to the Mountains</p>

<p>On the following Sunday I met with my<br/>
Ward the 14th for an organization according to the arrangement appointed<br/>
and I warned the people to repent before the Lord lest a scourge come<br/>
upon them. I was followed by Elders [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson<br/>
Pratt]] and brother Smith reproached the people for their treatment towards<br/>
me in not building me a<strike>n</strike> habitation for the Winter as I had been<br/>
sick.</p>

<p>We were informed that there was to be a meeting at<br/>
the Stand so we dismissed ours and repared to the meeting place where<br/>
we found a large congregation assembled and President Young addressing</p>",
42658.0,190,,"<p>[START HERE] them. The following are some of the words which fell from [[Brigham Young|his]] lips which<br/>
I noted while present<br/>
<u>President</u> <u>Young</u> <u>Cryin</u>g <u>Repentance</u> <u>to the</u> <u>Camp</u> of <u>Israel</u></p>

<p>He loudly called upon the Camp of Israel to repent and said:<br/>
""You must stop your swearing; you must stop your cheating; you <br/>
must stop your lying; you must stop your stealing; you must stop<br/>
your whoredoms; you must stop your backbitings—speaking evil of the <br/>
Twelve speaking evil of me—you must stop these things and put away<br/>
your wickedness or you will be damned; you will be destroyed; you will <br/>
be visited by pestilence and plague and by the sword and you will fall <br/>
to the ground and I warn you and foreworn you of these things if you <br/>
do not repent. Yes councillors High Priests and Elders here in <br/>
the camp of Israel will say I will be damned if I pay my tithing or<br/>
if i will do this or that.</p>

<p>If God was like man he would hurl you down <br/>
to hell and let you lie and welter there a thousand years and his mercy<br/>
only keeps you out</p>

<p>There are many here who are corrupt and<br/>
rotten at the core and I have no more fellowship for them than I have<br/>
for [[John Cook Bennett|John C. Bennett]]. If I fellowship these things it will drag me <br/>
down to hell with you and I will not do it. Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] being <br/>
a very merciful man bore with these things until it took his life <br/>
but I will not do it. Men get led away by degrees until the devil<br/>
gets possession of their tabernacles and they are led captive at the will of the<br/>
devil</p>

<p>And now I say that these who are calculating<br/>
to continue in wickedness and serve the devil had better go no further <br/>
with this camp. They had better go to [[Missouri|Missouri]] and spend the <br/>
rest of the time with the gentiles; for I can swear to them if they<br/>
go with us and continue their wickedness their heads shall be </p>",
42658.0,191,,"<p>severed from their tabernacles and the devils that are in them shall have no tabernacles<br/>
to dwell in</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is there are many places which<br/>
we pass through that have been the slaughter<strike>in</strike> ground of the ancient Nephites<br/>
and Lamanites and the spirits of devils are hovering around it and if<br/>
you are not on your guard they will enter you and lead you captive at their<br/>
will; for if you are not governed by the Spirit of God you will be by the<br/>
spirit of the devil. If you are governed by the Spirit of God while in<br/>
such places and they cannot enter <strike>you</strike> ^any of you^ they will try to enter your cattle<br/>
your beast for they want to enter some tabernacle as they did the swine in<br/>
ancient days</p>

<p>I had rather go to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] with the<br/>
Twelve alone and not to have another soul with us than to have those who<br/>
will not be subject to the Priesthood but practice wickedness and<br/>
serve the devil for if we continue with this company and they do not<br/>
repent the righteous will fall with the wicked</p>

<p>There are people in this camp who are stealing<br/>
hay and wood and I know who they are. Will [[Brigham Young|I]] fellowship them?<br/>
No I will not; and because we know who is guilty of wickedness they think<br/>
we are fellowshiping them and doing the same ourselves but it is not<br/>
so. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] suffered much from the same cause. Because he<br/>
knew of the rascality and wickedness his enemies and many of the<br/>
Saints thought he was guilty of it himself. The truth of the matter<br/>
is those who are leading the house of Israel while in the path of their<br/>
duty know the wickedness that is among the people. It cannot<br/>
be hid from them for they are in vision all the time</p>

<p>I will now look a little upon the other<br/>
side of the question. I will say however that if we have a<br/>
mind to be subject to the will of the Devil Death Hell and the<br/>
grave—we may be and bow down to it all the day long or<br/>
we may have perfect power and triumph over it</p>

<p>Who am I surrounded by? By men<br/>
who have entered into covenant with God who have received endowments in</p>",
42658.0,192,,"<p>the temple and are called to be saviours upon Mount Zion. To save what<br/>
Our Fathers and Israel clear back to Fallen [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] who are still lying in<br/>
their graves and waiting for the redemption of their bodies through your<br/>
instrumentality. Then will you curse sware lie steal commit<br/>
adultery and take the name of God in vain? Pretty saviours you<br/>
would be. O shame! God and angels would blush at such<br/>
conduct. Then repent and do the work appointed you. Many<br/>
are overtaken in fault who desire to repent and turn to God. Shall<br/>
we cast such away. Nay; but bear with them as God bears with<br/>
us. We cannot be sanctified all at once but have to<br/>
be tried and placed in all kinds of shapes and proven to the utmost<br/>
to see whether we will serve the Lord unto the end so that we may<br/>
be safe when we come into the Kingdom of God and not do as<br/>
Lucifer did the first time an opportunity is offered—rebel against<br/>
God and the Council of Heaven and be hurled down to hell in a<br/>
manner that you could not be redeemed at all</p>

<p>You must not sin murmur and complain<br/>
while in the midst of your trials because you have been mobbed<br/>
and tried even to the utmost. It is no excuse for you to commit<br/>
a wicked deed, take the name of God in vain or do any evil.<br/>
Now all of you forsake it. Repent and turn to God and you<br/>
shall be blessed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding [[Brigham Young|I]] have thus reproved<br/>

<p><u>Summary of the Year</u></p>

<p>During the year 1846 my time had not been occupied in<br/>
preaching in the vineyard and building up churches. I felt the field<br/>
of my labours in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] at the office and in the British Mission<br/>
in general at the beginning of this year. Since then I had<br/>
crossed the Atlantic and travelled the bredth of the United States<br/>
gathered my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]] and [[Betsey Cossett Alvord|cousin]] to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with me<br/>
I arrived in Nauvoo on the 13th of April after a severely tiresome<br/>
long and dangerous passage in which the storms were so constant<br/>
and tremendous that I saw not a fire on ship board for the<br/>
space of 30 days. On my arrival in the city of the<br/>
Saints where I joined my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children who had only reached home<br/>
a few days before me I found that President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and the Twelve<br/>
had led out the camp of Israel into the wilderness and without a<br/>
moments rest after my return I gathered up my friends and a company<br/>
of Saints from the Gentiles and joined the camp of Israel in<br/>
their journeyings to the wilderness and passed through all the trials<br/>
privations labours and sufferings attendent on such a journey; and<br/>
in spite of my severe accident and broken bones late in the year I built<br/>
my own house helped the building of others cut down and drew my wood<br/>
and hay and generally assisted with the Twelve in establishing<br/>
[[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]]. Thus ended the year with the cares of the<br/>
Twelve daily increasing</p>",

<p>At the beginning of the year I looked over and<br/>
arranged my journals and the following is</p>

<p>A Summary of My History for the Last 13 Years</p>

<p>Since 1834 I had travelled sixty one thousand six hundred and<br/>
ninety two miles crossed the Atlantic four times travelled ^several times^ through<br/>
[[England|England]] [[Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Wales|Wales]] and on six Islands of the Sea through twenty<br/>

nine meetings <strike>led</strike> eighty six conference and one hundred and<br/>
twenty three councils. I baptized 634 persons and assisted<br/>

Elders at one time in Nauvoo not recorded in my journal or enumerated<br/>
in the above. I had administered by annointing and<br/>
laying on of hands unto 364 six persons many of whom were healed</p>",

preaching places &amp; had 10 mobs rise against me. I recorded 30 of<br/>
the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] sermons and 25 of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<br/>
I wrote 1040 letters received 699. I collected for the building of<br/>
the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] of the Lord in Kirtland [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] 1674 dollars also 5000<br/>
dollars for assisting in the printing of the works of the Latter-day Saints<br/>
I procured 205 subscribers for the periodicals published by the Saints<br/>
I printed the ""Times and Seasons"" and ""Neighbour"" in connection with Elder<br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] for two years and I printed 2500 copies of the Millenial Star<br/>
at [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] and published 3000 copies of the Book of Doctrines and<br/>
Covenants and secured the copyright of it at [[Stationers|Stationers Hall]] London<br/>
printed 3000 Hymn Books and 20,000 of the Proclamation <u>called</u><br/>
the Proclamation of the Twelve Apostles.</p>

<p>During this above period I was ordained to the<br/>
office of Teacher Priest Elder member of the second quorum of the<br/>
Seventies first quorum of the Seventies and one of the Twelve<br/>
Apostles; received my anointing sealing and endowments from<br/>
and under the hands of [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
by order of Joseph the Prophet.</p>

<p>There were many things of interest transpiring<br/>
in the councils of the Twelve held in the beginning of the year 1847<br/>
which I did not write in my journal as Elder [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]<br/>
was present. He was the Recorder and Historian of the Church<br/>

<p>""The Word and Will of the Lord concerning the Camp<br/>
of Israel in their journeyings to the West""</p>

<p>""Let all the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of<br/>
Latter-Day Saints and those who journey with them be organized<br/>
into companies with a covenant and promise to keep all the commandments<br/>
and statutes of the Lord our God. Let the companies be organized with<br/>
captains of hundreds captains of fifties and captains of tens with a<br/>
president and his two counsellors at this head under the direction of<br/>
the Twelve Apostles: And this shall be our covenant that we will<br/>
walk in all the ordinances of the Lord.</p>

<p>Let each company provide themselves<br/>
with all the teams waggons provissions clothing and other necessaries<br/>
for the journey that they can. When the companies are organized<br/>
let them go to with their might to prepare for those who are to<br/>
tarry. Let each company with their captains and presidents<br/>
decide how many can go next spring; then choose out a sufficient<br/>
number of able bodied and expert men to take teams seeds and farming<br/>
utensils to go as pioneers to prepare for putting in Spring crops.<br/>
Let each company bear an equal proportion according to the dividend of<br/>
their property in taking the poor the widows the fatherless and the<br/>
families of those who have gone into the army that the crys of the<br/>
widow and the fatherless come not up into the ears of the Lord<br/>
against this people</p>

<p>Let each company prepare houses and fields<br/>
for raising grain for those who are to remain behind this season</p>",
42658.0,199,,"<p>and this is the will of the Lord concerning His people. <strike>Let every man</strike></p>

<p>Let every man use all his influence and property to<br/>
remove this people to the place where the Lord shall locate a stake of Zion:<br/>
and if ye do this with a pure heart in all faithfulness ye shall be blessed:<br/>
you shall be blessed in your flocks and in your lands and in your<br/>
fields and in your houses and in your families.</p>

<p>Let my servants [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]] and [[Erastus Snow|Erastus<br/>
Snow]] organize a company and let my servants [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and Wilford<br/>
Woodruff organize a company also let my servants [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]<br/>
and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] organize a company and appoint presidents<br/>
and captains of Hundreds and of Fifties and of Tens: and let my<br/>
servants that have been appointed go and teach this my will to<br/>
the Saints that they may be ready to go to a land of peace.<br/>
Go thy way and do as I have told you and fear not thine enemies<br/>
for they shall not have power to stop my work.</p>

<p>Zion shall be redeemed in my own due time<br/>
and if any man shall seek to build up himself and seeketh not my<br/>
counsel he shall have no power and his folly shall be made manifest<br/>
Seek ye and keep all your pledges one with another and covent not that<br/>
which is thy brothers. Keep yourselves from evil to take<br/>
not the name of thy God in vain; for I am the Lord your God<br/>
even the God of your fathers the God of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] and of [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]]<br/>
and of [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]]. I am he who led the children of Israel<br/>
out of the Land of [[Egypt|Egypt]] and my arm is stretched out in the<br/>
last days to save my people Israel</p>

<p>Cease to contend one with another<br/>
cease to speak evil one of another cease drunkeness and let your<br/>
words tend to edifying one another. If thou borrowest of thy neighbour<br/>
thou shalt restore that which thou hast borrowed and if thou canst<br/>
not repay then go straight way and tell thy neighbour lest he<br/>
condemn thee. If thou shalt find that which thy neighbour<br/>
has lost thou shalt make dilligent search till thou shalt deliver<br/>
it to him again</p>",
42658.0,200,,"<p>Thou shalt be diligent in preserving what thou hast that<br/>
thou mayest be a wise steward for it is the free gift of the Lord thy<br/>
God and thou art His steward.</p>

<p>If thou art merry praise the Lord with<br/>
singing with music with dancing and with a prayer of praise and<br/>
thanksgiving. If thou art sorrowful call on the Lord thy<br/>
God with supplication that your souls may be joyful. Fear<br/>
not thine enemies for they are in mine hands and I will<br/>
do my pleasure with them. My people must be tried<br/>
in all things that they may be prepared to receive the Glory<br/>
that I have for them even the glory of Zion and he that will<br/>
not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom</p>

<p>Let him that is ignorant learn wisdom<br/>
by humbling himself and calling upon the Lord his God that his<br/>
eyes may be opened that he may see and his ears opened that he<br/>
may hear; for my spirit is sent forth into the world to enlighten<br/>
the humble and contrite and to the condemnation of the ungodly</p>

<p>Thy brethren have rejected you and your<br/>
testimony even the nation that has driven you out and now<br/>
cometh the day of their calamity even the days of sorrow-like<br/>
a woman that is taken in trava<strike>l</strike>il and their sorrows shall be<br/>
great unless they speedily repent yea very speedily for they<br/>
killed the Prophets and they that were sent unto them and they<br/>
have shed inocent blood which cri<strike>s</strike>eth from the ground<br/>
against them. Therefore marvel not at those things<br/>
for ye are not yet pure:  Thou canst not yet bear<br/>
my glory but thou shalt behold it if ye are faithful in<br/>
keeping all my words that I have given you from the days<br/>
of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] to [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] from Abraham to [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] from Moses<br/>
to Jesus and the Apostles and from Jesus and his Apostles<br/>

because of his death; but it was needful that he should seal his testimony with<br/>
his blood that he might be honoured and the wicked might be condemned</p>

<p>Have I not delivered you from your enemies,<br/>
only in that I have left a witness of my name? Now therefore hearken<br/>
O ye people of my Church and ye Elders listen together. You have received<br/>
my kingdom; be diligent in keeping all my commandments lest<br/>
judgement come upon you and your faith fail you and your enemies<br/>

42658.0,203,1847-02-15,"<p>Feb</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",02/15/1847
42658.0,203,,""">15</time>th I met in Council with the Presidents and Counsellors<br/>
captains of hundreds Fifties and Tens to farther the organization of the camp of<br/>
Israel: I received an appointment to go to [[Keg Creek, Mills, Pottawattamie, Harrison and Shelby Counties, Iowa|Kegg Creek]] with brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]]<br/>
to organize the people there</p>

<p>Next day was a very interesting day to me. I<br/>
attended the family meeting of President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and he addressed<br/>
the meeting at great length during the day and evening. There were<br/>
present of the quorum of the Twelve Brigham Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] Wilford Woodruff [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa<br/>
Lyman]] and [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]].</p>

<p>After singing and prayer by President Young<br/>
he arose and addressed the meeting and remarked that he had invited<br/>
the Twelve to be present though they were not of his family yet he<br/>
wished them to act free and speak such things as the Lord shall give<br/>
them. He said, ""Let me state a principle by which you may<br/>
contemplate much. For the word of understanding many have<br/>
suffered jealousies to arise which afflicted their minds with<br/>
borrowed troubles and uneasiness fearing the Lord loved some<br/>
others more than themselves. This I have seen in the<br/>
Church ever since its rise. It was manifest in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. When<br/>
the first [[Edward Partridge|Bishop]] was ordained. This jealous feeling was manifest<br/>
Some wondered if the Lord would think enough of them to ordain them<br/>
a Bishop. Father [[Isaac Morley|Morley]] and others who were present can bear<br/>
record of this fact And when the Twelve were chosen the same<br/>
feeling existed and in fact I will not except all of them some of whom<br/>
manifested the same feelings when the Bishops were ordained. This<br/>
Spirit has been the overthrow of many in this Church and in fact<br/>
upon this principle thousands have fallen in all ages</p>

<p>The Lord gives to every man all the power<br/>
influence and authority he can wield in righteousness and all that his<br/>
goodness and faithfulness merits. Then why should jealousies<br/>
arise or what benefit can come by suffering such feelings to exist<br/>
Non at all; but he who cherishes such feelings commences trying</p>",
42658.0,204,,"<p>to pull down every one that is prospering or gaining influence as [[Cain (OT)|Cain]] did<br/>
instead of building up and nourishing every tree and thereby proving<br/>
himself worthy and showing to his brethren and to God that he loves<br/>
the cause and by his pasive spirit that he is not only willing<br/>
that offers should prosper and gain influence but that he actually<br/>
loves to see them prosper; for then he does all that he can through<br/>
himself if he helps to advance it through others although they receive <br/>
the honour of it and he still be aware of it. Such a man will never be<br/>
forgotten and to his honour and glory and exaltation there shall be<br/>
no end.</p>

<p>There is another principle that has<br/>
caused considerable uneasiness and trouble and that is the idea of<br/>
some men having more wives than one. Such tremendious<br/>
fears take hold of some that they hardly know how to live:<br/>
still they can't die. They began to whisper and talk around: ""I am<br/>
actually af<strike>f</strike>raid to go on a mission for fear some man will be sealed<br/>
to my wife""; and when they return some will be babling about<br/>
""You don't know but what you have got another man's wife"" and<br/>
they are a<strike>f</strike>fraid to speak to a young woman for fear that she belongs<br/>
to some one else or for fear some one else wants her. Others deny<br/>
the faith as they think (but they never had much) and say that it is<br/>
all of the devil. <strike>To</strike> Such foolishness ought not to be cherished among<br/>
a wise and prudent people.</p>

<p>Admiting the Lord created the same number<br/>
of woman as men at the beginning and commanded them to multiply<br/>
and replenish the earth and to fill up the measure of their creator in<br/>
righteousness the question is did they do it? Answer: No. They<br/>
soon disobeyed every commandment and plunged themselves into<br/>
wickedness and rendered themselves unworthy to raise up seed<br/>
unto the Lord and in fact used ever means in their power<br/>
to cut off life and hinder<strike>ing</strike> women answering the end for which<br/>
they were created. Nine tenths of them would rebel against<br/>
the very thing he was created to do. Hence you see the propriety of the</p>",
42658.0,205,,"<p>Lord calling upon men who hears the Pristhood to take to themselves wives from among<br/>
the daughters of men and raise up a righteous seed unto him that He might fill<br/>
up the measure of their creation and hasten the consummation of his purposes<br/>
in righteousness in this dispensation according to His word previously spoken<br/>
through His servants the Prophets.</p>

<p>Those who suffer fears and jealousies to arise<br/>
in their bosoms either back right out or get to be mighty righteous and for fear<br/>
they are sleeping with other men's wives they kick up a dust or broil at home<br/>
and perhaps abuse their own companion through jealousy then go off to<br/>
some woman that does not understand what is right or wrong and tell her<br/>
that she cannot be saved without a man and he has almighty power<br/>
and can exalt and save her and likely tell that there is no harm for them<br/>
to sleep together before they are sealed and then go to some dough-head<br/>
of an Elder and get him to say the ceremony and all done without the<br/>
knowledge of the Authority of this Church. This is not right<br/>
and will not be suffered. The God [[Brigham Young|I]] serve will reward every man<br/>
openly without his being under the necessity of going secretly and<br/>
privately proclaiming himself in the creativity of ignorant inocent<br/>
females.</p>

<p>Such jealousies do exist and were I to say<br/>
to the Elders you now have the liberty to build up your kingdoms one<br/>
half of them would lie swear steal and fight like the very devil to get<br/>
men and women sealed to them. They would even try to pass<br/>
right by me and go to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] thinking to get between him and<br/>
the Twelve. Some have already tried to use an<strike>d</strike> influence<br/>
against me but such jealousies and selfishness shall be stoped and<br/>
if the brethren do not stop it I will blow it to the four winds<br/>
by making them all come and be sealed to me and I to my [[John Hayden Young|father]]<br/>
and he and all this Church to Joseph</p>

<p>When I go astray and give wrong counsel<br/>
and lead this people astray then is time enough to pull me<br/>
down and then God will remove me as He has done all others<br/>
who have turned from the faith.</p>",
42658.0,206,,"<p>But to return. [[Brigham Young|I]] have gathered a number of families<br/>
around me by the law of adoption and seal of the covenant according to the<br/>
order of the Priesthood and others have done likewise it being the<br/>
means of salvation left to bring us back to God. But had the keys<br/>
of the Priesthood been retained and handed down from father to<br/>
son throughout all generations up to the present time then there<br/>
would have been no necessity of the law of adoption for<br/>
we would have all been included in the covenant without<br/>
it and have been legal heirs instead of being heirs according<br/>
to promise.</p>

<p>The Priesthood is eternal; without<br/>
begining of days or end of life as the Apostle has expressed<br/>
it; but man through apostacy which is entire disobedience<br/>
has lost or suffered the keys and privileges of the Priesthood<br/>
to be taken away from them and left to wander in darkness<br/>
and practise all manner of wickedness until thousands<br/>
became the vessels of wrath and were doomed to destruction<br/>
for as long as men are without the Priesthood They continue<br/>
to be without God and never retrace their steps until it is<br/>
done by the Priesthood. The idea of the Saint being<br/>
led by false Prophets is just a notion according to the light<br/>
in which they view them. All the false Prophets we<br/>
have are the men who have turned away from the truth.</p>

<p>The man is the head and god of the<br/>
woman but let him act like God in virtuous principles and<br/>
Godlike conversation walk and department. Such men will continue<br/>
to gain influence and power and advance in glory to all eternity<br/>
But should they use their power in wickedness as a tyrant they will soon<br/>
be called to render an account of their stewardship. If not<br/>
found worthy they will be hurled down to perdition and their<br/>
family and kingdom be given to another that is worthy. Some<br/>
say that a woman cannot be saved without a man: neither can <br/>
a man without a woman.</p>",
42658.0,207,,"<p>Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said he had taught the Twelve all he knew<br/>
concerning the order of the kingdom but the difficulty was they could not<br/>
remember it as he told them but when it was necessary they would<br/>
not be at a loss for understanding. And [[Brigham Young|I]] bear record of the truth<br/>
of his word before God this day that I always had an understanding and<br/>
everything was brought <strike>them</strike> to my mind just as he taught <strike>them</strike> ^it^ to<br/>
us. All the ordinances of the Temple and building of the altar &amp;c<br/>
came to me just right when they were to be attended to and could we<br/>
now know brother [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]]s feelings you would say<br/>
that they could read a man through as soon as they cast their eyes upon<br/>
him.</p>

<p>The Apostle [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] while speaking of the Fathers<br/>
and the ancients said that they without us could not be made perfect.<br/>
There was a lack in his story and still will be to all eternity until<br/>
the chain of that Priesthood is restored and every spirit take a tabernacle<br/>
that was forordained according to the dispensation of the will of God.</p>

<p>I am entitled to the keys of the Priesthood<br/>
according to linage and blood. So is brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
and many others—and have taken ^the various^ <strike>kingly power and grades</strike> <br/>
of the Priesthood. This we would have taught in the Temple<br/>
had time permitted. Joseph Smith was entitled to the keys<br/>
of the Priesthood according to blood. Still he was the fourth son.<br/>
But when we get another Temple built then we will teach you<br/>
concerning these things. Suffice it to say that I will extend<br/>
the chain of the Priesthood back through the Apostlolic Dispensation<br/>
to Father [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] just as soon as I can get a Temple built.</p>

<p>Jesus could have restored the order of <br/>
the Priesthood in his day and brought in the Millenium if the<br/>
people would have hearkened to his instructions but they rebelled and<br/>
would not and it was for this cause that Jesus told them<br/>
that all the blood which had been shed from righteous<br/>
[[Abel (OT)|Abel]] down to [[Zechariah (OT)|Zachariel]] the Prophet should be required<br/>
at their hands. [##Matthew 23:34-35##]</p>",
42658.0,208,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] have a request to make of my family and that<br/>
is that they (especially old people omit calling me their father.<br/>
Call me Brother Brigham. I shall fell better when yo[u] do<br/>
for I do not consider that I am worthy of that appelation. Father<br/>
in the Priesthood implies the great Head. The term would be<br/>
proper to Father [[Adam (OT)|Adam]]. Jesus had reference to the same<br/>
thing when he told his disciples not to call any man father<br/>
on earth for their Father was in heaven.</p>

<p>The seal of the covenant that I<br/>
have been speaking of to day was what the Apostle saw<br/>
previous to the destruction of the wicked when the angel<br/>
was commanded not to pour out the viall of wrath upon the<br/>
wicked until the Saints were sealed in their forehead<strike>s</strike><br/>
and when this was done they all became Father Adam's<br/>
family.</p>

<p>Those that ^belong to^ <strike>are adopted into</strike> my family<br/>
and take me for their Councillor if I continue faithful I<br/>
will preside over them throughout all eternity. I will<br/>
stand at their head and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] will stand at the head<br/>
of this Church and will be the President &amp; Prophet <strike>and God</strike><br/>
to the people in this dispensation.</p>

<p>When we locate I will settle<br/>
my family down in the order and teach them their duty.<br/>
They will then have to provide temporal blessings for<br/>
me instead of my boarding from 40 to 50 persons as<br/>
I now do. I will administer in spiritual blessings<br/>
to them. I expect to live in the House of the<br/>
Lord and receive and administer ordinances to my brethren<br/>
and for the dead all the year round.""</p>

<p>President [[Heber Chase Kimball|H.C. Kimball]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson<br/>
Pratt]] then address briefly President Young's family<br/>
meeting and then there was an intermission until</p>",
42658.0,209,,"<p>after supper.</p>

<p>The table was will furnished and supplied.<br/>
Forty persons could be seated at the table at a time. The men<br/>
were seated to the right with their companions opposite to them<br/>
commencing with the Twelve President [[Brigham Young|Young]] at their head; then in order<br/>
the ^rest^ <strike>adopted children begining with the 1st that was adopted.</strike> The<br/>
band and choir kept their seats and discoursed their sweet strain of<br/>
music while the guest were partaking of the rich festival.</p>

<p>While at table brother [[Thomas Woolsey|Thomas Wolsley]]<br/>
and [[John Harvey Tippets|John H Tippetts]] came in. They were direct from the<br/>
Mormon Battalion 280 miles south of [[Santa Fe, Mexican Cession Territory|Santa Fe]] on the river<br/>
[[Rio Grande River, United States|Rio Grande]] on the 10th of Nov. 1846. they had piloted fifty six<br/>
sick men to [[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Pueblo]] where Cap [[John Brown|Brown]]'s estableshment was<br/>
stationed. From thence they came in on packmules were<br/>
50 days on the way and were taken prisoners twice by the<br/>
Indians and once was sentenced to death by the Pawnees. For<br/>
thirty days they were without bread and five days were without<br/>
much of anything to eat. These brethren brought a package<br/>
of 137 letters and a good account from Fort Pueblo <strike>but rather<br/>
unfavorable from the Battalion who were described as resembling<br/>
mountineers in their persons.</strike></p>

<p>The arrived of these brethren in the<br/>
camp produced no small stir. Men and women came from<br/>
all directions to enquire after their friends in the army.</p>

<p>After the men were refreshed we went<br/>
into council with them and they rehearsed the salvation of the Battalion.<br/>
The brethren composing it had been on half rations for three weeks<br/>
when they left them and no prespects of more than half rations<br/>
should they attempt to cross the mountains that Winter. Report<br/>
however had reached Santa Fe when they arrived that the<br/>
Battalion had taken the [[El Paso del Norte, Chihuahua, Mexico|Alpasio]] a strong hold between the<br/>
Rio Grande and the Mountains without the firing of a gun<br/>
President Young said that if they had hearkened to his counsel</p>",
42658.0,210,,"<p>not a man of them would have fallen but would all have returned to their<br/>
friends in perfect safety.</p>

<p>We returned to the [[Council House, Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Council House]] at 7 o'clock.<br/>
The Saints were rejoicing in what they had heard that day and after Elder<br/>
[[Isaac Morley|Isaac Morley]] had expressed himself upon the occassion President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
arose and continued his remarks upon the Law of adoption.</p>

<p>""The Lord introduced the law of adoption for the<br/>
benefit of the children of men as a schoolmaster to bring them back<br/>
into the covenant of the Priesthood. This principle I am<br/>
aware is not clearly understood by many ^of the^ Elders in this church<br/>
at the present time as it will hereafter be: and I confess that<br/>
I have only a smattering of those things; but when it is<br/>
necessary I will attain to more knowledge upon the subject<br/>
and consequently shall be enabled to teach and practice more.<br/>
In the mean time glorify God the bountiful Giver.</p>

<p>I have heard Elders say they were<br/>
not dependant upon any man. It was saying more than<br/>
I can say for I consider that we are all dependant one<br/>
upon another for our exaltation and that our interest is<br/>
inseperably connected. For example: What can my family<br/>
do without me. Supposing they were to all turn away<br/>
from me. I hold the keys over them through which they are to receive<br/>
their exaltation. Would they not be like sheep without a shepherd?<br/>
and be devoured by the wolves? They certainly would. Then<br/>
let us change the position and say that I would cut off all my<br/>
family then what glory would I have with no body to rule over<br/>
but my own dear little self. To tell you my feelings<br/>
I would rather be annihilated than to be in that situation.</p>

<p>This is another proof of the Apostle's<br/>
saying when he declared that they without us could not be made<br/>
perfect. Neither can you without me nor I without<br/>
you that is to say if we are faithful for without faithfullness</p>",
42658.0,211,,"<p>there is no perfection on any consideration.</p>

<p>This rule applies to the whole human family.<br/>
This is the torment and misery of the disobedient spirits that they cannot<br/>
be made perfect unless some scheme should hereafter be introduced<br/>
for their redemption.</p>

<p>They are now without tabernacles to dwell in<br/>
only such as they have taken possession of unlawfully and usurped<br/>
power over. It is a part of their agency that was allowed them which<br/>
they use to the consummation of their unhappy and wretched estate it<br/>
being the reward and fruits of their doings having been given over to<br/>
all manner of wickedness and permitted to afflict the handy work of the<br/>
Lord until they fill up the cup of their iniquity. Then the Lord<br/>
will say unto them, ""Thou wicked and disobedient spirit thou<br/>
shalt not have power any longer to afflict my people or destroy the works<br/>
of my hands: you have forfeited your agency and wrought your fulness;<br/>
depart hence to the pit that I have prepared for thee.</p>

<p>This is their torment that their power<br/>
and agency is taken from them and they are left to regret that it<br/>
was through their own disobedience they cut the thread of their own<br/>
salvation. This reflection only serves to torture and<br/>
increase their torment.</p>

<p>And this would be the situation of my<br/>
family were they to cut themselves off from me. [[Brigham Young|I]] use my family<br/>
as an example not that I have the least fears, of their ever doing<br/>
so, for I have none.</p>

<p>I feel happy this night because we are<br/>
of one mind. Still should I believe that we were perfect and<br/>
could not advance any farther I should not be happy. But to<br/>
the honour power and glory of the faithful there is no end.</p>

<p>For your satisfaction I will show you<br/>
a rule by which you may comprehend the exaltation of the<br/>
faithful. I will use myself as a figure and say that I am<br/>
ruling over ten sons or subjects and soon each of them would have</p>",
42658.0,212,,"<p>ten more sealed to them and they would be rulers over them and that<br/>
would make me ruler over ten Presidents or kings whereas [[Brigham Young|I]] was ruler<br/>
over ten subjects only: or in other words I ruled over one kingdom<br/>
but now I should rule over ten. Then let each get ten more<br/>
then I should be ruler over one hundred kingdoms and so on continued<br/>
to all eternity. The more honour and glory that I could<br/>
bestow upon my sons the more it would add to my exaltation<br/>
but to clip the thread of your exaltation then where would be<br/>
your glory? It would be like the fallen angels or devils<br/>
that kept not their first estate but were reserved in<br/>
everlasting chains of darkness unto the judgement of the<br/>
great day. Others fell from heaven were thrust down<br/>
to hell. But if you wish to advance hold up the<br/>
hands of your file leader. Should you have ten legions<br/>
of trains following on after you, you should say to<br/>
your file leader push ahead for I am coming with<br/>
my train lifting him up at the same time instead of<br/>
trying to pass by him. This would stimulate <br/>
him and he would say come on my boys I will travel<br/>
as fast as you can and on we would go in one solid<br/>
train to all eternity.</p>

<p>Before I close I will answer one<br/>
question that has been asked me repeatedly. Should I have<br/>
a father dead who has never heard this gosepl would<br/>
it be required of me to redeem him and have him adopted<br/>
into some man's family and I be adopted unto my father<br/>
I answer no.</p>

<p>If we have to attend to the ordinances<br/>
of redemption for our dead relatives we then become their<br/>
saviors and were we to wait to redeem our dead relatives<br/>
before we could link the chain of the Priesthood we would never<br/>
accomplish it.""</p>

<p>Many other remarks were made</p>",
42658.0,213,1847-02-18,"<p>and at the close there was a little exercise by music and dancing another<br/>
meeting was dismissed.</p>

<p>Brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] and myself left [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter quarters]]<br/>
on the <time datetime=""",02/18/1847
42658.0,213,1847-03-04,""">18</time>th on our mission to [[Keg Creek, Mills, Pottawattamie, Harrison and Shelby Counties, Iowa|Keg Creek]]. We rode to [[Council Point, Iowa|Council<br/>
Point]] the first day where we found that Branch assembled for meeting<br/>
We addressed the meeting and I read the revelation given at Winter<br/>
Quarters and took a note upon it.</p>

<p>Next day we travelled to [[Mosquito Creek, Iowa|Miskitoe<br/>
Creek]] and on the following one we visited the Branch of<br/>
the Church in that place and organized it according to the pattern<br/>
given. We then drove our team to Keg Creek. There was<br/>
a snow storm during the day and our horses suffered<br/>
much on the journey in the storm.</p>

<p>On the Sunday I met with the Branch<br/>
at Keg Creek and addressed the congregation in much plainness<br/>
and rebuked some false spirits and was followed by Elder<br/>
Smoot. We took the names for organizing and rode<br/>
twelve miles back to brother [[Robert C. Petty|Petty]]'s and spent the night. We had<br/>
about 2 feet of snow to travel through.</p>

<p>Next day was very cold but we travelled<br/>
30 miles through the snow to Winter Quarters.</p>

<p>During the next ten days I met several<br/>
times with the 1st Division and captains of hundreds in furthering<br/>
the organization and its design and again on the <time datetime=""",03/04/1847
42658.0,213,,""">4th of March</time><br/>
met in council with the first division and several speeches were<br/>
made by several of the brethren concerning our location in<br/>
Winter Quarters &amp; our journey westward. President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
said he should go as he was directed by the Lord and<br/>
he requested The Saints to be ready to start on the 15th.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 11th I met with the<br/>
Saints in our Ward. Bishop Smoot addressed the people<br/>
I followed and required the people who had means to carry<br/>
something to the Bishop for the poor and after meetings I</p>",
42658.0,214,1847-03-12,"<p>went home and took for my part flour meal sugar and coffee for<br/>
that object to the Bishop and then <strike>myself and</strike> brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]]<br/>
and <strike>I</strike> myself took of the substance donated for the poor and visited<br/>
the sick and administered to them spiritually and temporally.</p>

<p>About this time brothers [[Alexander McRae|McCray]] and<br/>
[[Andrew Losee Lamoreaux|Lummeroux]] arrived in camp from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. McCray<br/>
had been in prison and many of the brethren had been imprisoned<br/>
and some hung by the mob until they were nearly dead.</p>

<p>I spent the <time datetime=""",03/12/1847

preparing for our journey; and on the following one I was<br/>
unwell but attended a musical concert in the [[Council House, Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Council House]]<br/>

bed being so ill.</p>

<p>I was somewhat better two days<br/>
later and continued preparing for the Pioneer journey, <strike>This</strike><br/>
and attended the funeral of sister [[Phebe Traine|Phebe Traine]]. There was at<br/>
this time much sickness and death in the camp.</p>

<p>Sunday the <time datetime=""",03/21/1847

assembled in a general meeting on the public square, President<br/>
Young addressed the congregation upon a variety of subjects.<br/>

<p>The next morning was very cold; but<br/>
there was a meeting of the Presidency and captains of company's</p>",
42658.0,215,1847-03-27,"<p>and it was resolved to <strike>stockade</strike> the city of [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] and for the Twelve<br/>
to go forward to pick out a resting place for the Saints. In the<br/>
evening I attended a council of the Bishops and Twelve; and a variety of<br/>
subjects was brought up.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] spoke upon Patriarchal<br/>
blessings and the blessing of children and said that any father<br/>
who held the Priesthood was a Patriarch to his own family and<br/>
when he blessed his children it was a Patriarchal blessing. If<br/>
a man wrote the blessing of his children and could get the<br/>
Historian to record it that was all right enough but the Historian<br/>
could not write all the blessings in the Church.</p>

<p>Next day the Presidency and Bishops<br/>
met to decide where the lines of the city should be and two days<br/>
later the Camp of Israel held a public meeting.</p>

<p>In the evening I met with my company<br/>
and expressed my feelings to them concerning labouring together<br/>
for the season in raising grain and taking care of the familes<br/>
of those who were going in the Pioneer company. The<br/>
spirit of union prevailed in the matter.</p>

administered to five persons and met with the Twelve High Council<br/>

<p>Next morning I met with the Presidency<br/>
Captains of Hundreds and Pioneer Company and it was<br/>
finally agreed that those who were ready should start on the morrow for the<br/>
[[Elkhorn River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Horn]]. It was fine weather.</p>

<p>On the evening of the last of the month<br/>
I was with the Presidency and Captains of Hundreds in Council and<br/>
expressed my mind with others upon the subject of ^stockading^ <strike>barracading</strike><br/>
the city and uniting together in labour in cultivating the earth.<br/>

go to the East and procure a Printing Press and type and<br/>
receive a recommendation to that effect.</p>

of Israel to find a location and a resting place for the Saints while the<br/>
judgements of God are poured out upon the earth. The burden and<br/>
cares of the Church and my family rested heavily upon my mind and<br/>
I never felt more in leaving my family to go on a mission than<br/>
now but I prayed that the Lord would sustain them as he had done<br/>
in the many missions which I had taken. I assisted brother [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
in the evening to pack up his waggon.</p>

<p>The day after the General Conference I took<br/>
leave of my family and friends and started with my company<br/>
of Pioneer waggons 8 in number and left Winter Quarters for<br/>
our journey to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] to select a location for the<br/>
Church and prepare for the body of the Saints to follow.</p>

<p>When we were on the top of the<br/>
ridge west of the city I took a view of the city and looked<br/>
at my wife and children though my glass. I then led<br/>
the company to the old camp ground from thence on the<br/>
Punkaw road about 7 miles and camped for the night, ten<br/>
miles from Winter Quarters.</p>

<p>We had excellent stables for our<br/>
horses in a valley near a small stream of water. We<br/>
had not been camped long before Brother [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] and his<br/>
company arrived and close upon them President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and<br/>
his Company so we all camped together about 25 waggons<br/>
of us and it was a very windy night.</p>

<p>In the morning we arose and took<br/>
breakfast. A squirel was killed and it being the first<br/>
game killed by the Pioneer Companies I moved that the<br/>
first fruits of the game be offered to the Priest: so it was<br/>
presented to President Young for his breakfast.</p>

<p>President Young Father [[Isaac Morley|Morley]] and others<br/>
went to the old camping ground to pick them out a place for<br/>
a farm and I with several others spent the day in hunting<br/>
<strike>could</strike> but caught nothing but weary limbs and wet feet. We saw<br/>
however deer geese ducks &amp;c.</p>",
42658.0,219,,"<p><u>Commence here</u></p>

<p>When I returned to camp in the evening from our<br/>
unsuccessful hunting expedition I learned that [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] had arrived<br/>
at [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] from his mission to [[England|England]], and that President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and others had gone back to the city to see him.</p>

<p>In the morning I mounted my horse<br/>
and started for Winter Quarters to see brother Parley the Twelve my<br/>
family and others. Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] was at our camp the day before<br/>
while I was out hunting and left a letter for me in answer to the<br/>
one I had written to her.</p>

<p>Before I got to the city I met the<br/>
Twelve. I was within half a mile of home yet I turned about<br/>
with them returned to the camp of pioneers harnessed our<br/>
horses and drove until dark 10 miles towards the [[Elkhorn River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Horn]] leaving<br/>
brothers Young and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] several miles behind.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we started<br/>
drove to the Horn and crossed it with all ^our^ teams ^on a raft^ before sunset.</p>

<p>The following was Sunday. We crossed<br/>
over 20 waggons in the morning and then Presidents Young<br/>
and Kimball arrived with their companions and we<br/>
continued to ferry them until they were all over. We moved<br/>
down our encampment 2 miles and spent the night.</p>

<p>Next day the encampment moved up the <br/>
[[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]] 14 miles; but the quorum of the Twelve and others recrossed<br/>
the Horn and returned to Winter Quarters. Four of us followed<br/>
an Indian trail and cut off 15 miles. It was 35 miles by the<br/>
waggon route but only 20 the way we went.</p>

<p>I was very busy the next day painting<br/>
one of my waggons to take away and sell. I got another horse<br/>
to take away with me and was in council with the quorum<br/>
of the Twelve until midnight. Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] was with<br/>
us. He arrived in the city in the evening on this return<br/>
from England. We were all glad to meet him once more.<br/>
He brought for our use on this Pioneer journey two Sextants</p>",
42658.0,220,,"<p>two baromaters two artificial horizons one circle of reflection<br/>
and one telescope, all of which were exhibited to us in the<br/>
evening and boxed up so that we could take them along.</p>

<p>Next day I called together my family<br/>
and blessed my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children and left them in the<br/>
hands of the Lord. I bade farewell to Father [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Woodruff]]<br/>
and family and all around me and took my leave<br/>
of [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] and in company with Elders [[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]]<br/>
[[Amasa Mason Lyman|A. Lyman]] [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]] [[Erastus Snow|E. Snow]] and others we again<br/>
took the Indian trail and rode through the Prairie to<br/>
[[Elkhorn River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Elk Horn]] and went over on a raft and camped two miles<br/>
below the Ferry. We had an excellent supper of<br/>
fried catfish pork beans short-cake honeycomb coffee<br/>
milk &amp;c. We all eat very hearty. had prayers &amp; retired to bed.</p>

<p>Professor O Pratt the next morning<br/>
took an observation for the correct time. Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Newel Kimball Whitney|Whitney]] and others came and crossed the ferry<br/>
and we all moved up to the general camp on the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte<br/>
River]] 9 miles in advance of us. We found the camp<br/>
very busy in blacksmith work preparing to ^continue^ <strike>contue</strike> our<br/>
journey.</p>

<p>Brother [[Jesse Carter Little|Jesse C. Little]] arrived from<br/>
the Eastern States in our midst. Finding us not at<br/>
Winter Quarters he followed and overtook us this evening. He<br/>
gave us news of the Eastern Churches and brought a remembrance<br/>
to the quorum of the Twelve from our friend Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]]<br/>
in a variety of presents to us. The Col. had sent me a<br/>
patent life preserver and a stop-compass.</p>

<p>Brothers Little [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|Rockwell]] and [[Jack Reading|Reading]]<br/>
returned to Winter Quarters next morning and the camp continued<br/>
4 miles up the Platte.</p>

<p>Before we left this morning the camp<br/>
came together and was organised <strike>the</strike> for journeying <strike>as a military</strike></p>",
42658.0,221,,"<p>as a military body into companies of hundreds fifties and tens.<br/>
but [[Stephen Markham|Stephen Markham]] and [[Albert Perry Rockwood|A.P. Rockwood]] were appointed<br/>

<p>The camp consisted of 73 waggons 143 men 3 women<br/>
and two children making in all 148 souls.</p>

<p>We travelled 8 miles next day and camped<br/>
in the border of a grove of cottonwood to spend the Sabbath. In the<br/>
afternoon the organization of the camp was completed according to the<br/>
following order: Brigham [[Brigham Young|Young]] Lieutenant General [[Stephen Markham|Stephen Markham]]<br/>

<p><u>General</u> <u>Orders</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>Camp</u><br/>
Orders from General Young was for the whole regiment<br/>
to journey in a compact body as we were in an Indian country<br/>
and for every man to carry his gun loaded the cap locks to<br/>
be shut on a piece of buckskin with caps ready to slip on at<br/>
the instant in case of attack, for flint locks with cotton or tow<br/>
in the pan and powder flask always handy to prime quickly<br/>
and for every man to walk by the side of his waggon and not<br/>
to leave it except sent away by order. The object of all this<br/>
caution was to prevent accident for strict discipline was necessary<br/>
while travelling through a hostile Indian country.</p>",
42658.0,222,1847-04-18,"<p>Some traders came down from the Pawnees and camped<br/>
with us over night. They had plenty of Buffaloo meat dried and they gave<br/>
us what we wished and informed us that we were within two days<br/>
drive of <strike>the whole</strike> ^a large band^ of the Pawnees. We camped here in<br/>
a line for the Sabbath.</p>

<p><time datetime=""",04/18/1847
42658.0,222,,""">Sunday the 18</time> President [[Brigham Young|Young]] called<br/>
the captains together and gave them instructions concerning our travel.<br/>
We were to start in the morning two abreast all who were not driving<br/>
teams were to carry their guns and walk by the side of the waggons<br/>
and no man to go hunting to get out of sight of the camp. In<br/>
the ^evening^ <strike>morning</strike> the bugle was to be blown at ^5 o'clock^ <strike>half past 8 o'clock</strike> and<br/>
the camp to arise and pray cook eat feed horses harness them &amp;<br/>
and start at the call of the bugle at 7 o'clock and at night<br/>
the bugle was to be blown at half past eight when all w<strike>as</strike>ere to<br/>
go to prayers in their several waggons and retire to bed by<br/>
9 o'clock. Each Saturday night we were to pitch<br/>
our tents or camp in our waggons and rest f<strike>or</strike>rom our journey<br/>
on the Sabbath. This was the order of The Camp.</p>

<p>It was quite cold on Monday morning.<br/>
The bugle blew at five o'clock for prayers and at seven for starting.<br/>
We travelled according to general orders and bore a no[r]therly direction<br/>
until about noon when we reached the north bend of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]]<br/>
10 1/2 miles north of the ford. Professor [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] took an<br/>
observation and found it to be in Lat. 41. 27. 5.: The crossing<br/>
place of the [[Elkhorn River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Horn]] was in Lat. 41. 16. 24., making the North<br/>
Bend of the Platt 10 1/2 miles north of the ford. We formed<br/>
a circle at noon and baited.</p>

<p>While nooning Elder [[Jesse Carter Little|Little]] [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|P. Rockwell]]<br/>
and two others arrived and brought the meal. I received<br/>
two letters one from my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and one from [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]]<br/>
of [[Massachusetts|Mass]] who informed me that [[Milton Holmes|Milton Homes]] and his [[Nathaniel Holmes|father]]<br/>
and [[Abigail Poor Holmes|mother]] had turned strangites and been cut off the church.</p>

<p>Brother Little brought with him</p>",
42658.0,223,,"<p>many things that Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|T Kane]] had sent as presents to the Twelve and others. I<br/>
recieved a stop-box marriners compass small enough to carry in the pocket.<br/>
It was a splendid present.</p>

<p>We camped at night near a grove of timber on<br/>
the bank of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]] where we formed a circle on the edge of the bank.<br/>
The river on one side was our defence and the forewheel of each waggon was<br/>
drove up to the hinder wheel of the one before it and all the horses<br/>
and cattle taken inside of the corrall: so that we were secure against<br/>
the Indians.</p>

<p>There was a hard wind during the night and<br/>
the morning was fair but a strong south ^west^ wind which covered our waggons<br/>
with sand dust.</p>

<p>The grass was now about 4 inches high s[c]attering<br/>
and there was not half feed for our animals so all along thus far we<br/>
had to cut down cottonwood trees &amp;c to feed them and the horses<br/>
would knaw off the bark from brouse limbs as readily<br/>
as they would eat corn of which we gave to each horse 2 quarts<br/>
per day.</p>

<p>We started on our journey 2 1/2 miles and<br/>
came to another grove of small and large cottonwood covering<br/>
about 40 acres. It was about 5 miles to the tableland<br/>
which was now rising into a bluff. Here the road runs 20<br/>
degrees south of the west Bending to S. by W. one mile in<br/>
which distance we passed three Islands in the Platte covered<br/>
with timber the largest of which was about ten acres and<br/>
there continues a chain of Islands for miles along the river<br/>
and some timber on the south side of the Platte.</p>

<p>Three miles from our last encampment<br/>
we came to [[Shell Creek, Nebraska Territory|Shell Creek]] and one and half miles from Shell<br/>
Creek is a Prairie Dog village covering about 6 acres of ground.<br/>
This Creek was timbered only by a few scattering willows. <strike>and<br/>
the river was about parallel</strike></p>

<p>After crossing Shell Creek bridge the</p>",
42658.0,224,,"<p>road runs about S.W. by W. 60 degrees west of South for about 15 miles.<br/>
<u>The Platt is skirted <strike>by</strike>with timber</u></p>

<p>Professor [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] and myself went forward<br/>
of the company to take observations. After travelling 13 miles we<br/>
stoped baited horses and took observations. The company approached us<br/>
and we continued on 5 miles and the whole encampment came up and<br/>
we camped for the night in a cirlce and cut down cottonwood trees to<br/>
feed our horses.</p>

<p>The following day was <strike>A</strike> cloudy day <strike>was the next one</strike> with a <br/>
light sprinkling of rain and wind in the east and our course westward.<br/>
The teams started at 7 o'clock and the horse teams between 8 and 9.<br/>
An Indian appeared on a mound mounted on a poney about 5 miles<br/>
from us. He went out of sight and again appeared. He then<br/>
approached the camp full speed was met by the brethren and<br/>
shook hands and was followed by seven others. They went through<br/>
the encampment and then returned with us.</p>

<p>We travelled til half past 12 o'clock when<br/>
when we came in sight of 70 Indian horses and mules and soon in<br/>
sight of a large Pawnee village on the North side of [[Loup Fork, Nebraska Territory|Loop Fork]] and<br/>
also one on the south side of it. We drove on by the villages<br/>
and they soon began to sally out to come to us and we camped<br/>
in the form of a half moon the bank of the river forming<br/>
a parallel line in front.</p>

<p>The Indians to the number of about<br/>
200 0n the South side of the river came down to the shore. Some<br/>
waded over and about 75 came into camp including the grand chief<br/>
of the nation with many war chiefs. We met them before<br/>
we left the ground and made them presents of 4 <strike>1</strike> lbs of tobacco<br/>
15 lbs of lead powder fishhooks beads flour salt &amp;c but still<br/>
they were not satisfied. Considering our numbers they thought<br/>
they ought to have had more.</p>

<p>When we left the ground the<br/>
Indians oppeared very disatisfied but we harnessed up our teams</p>",
42658.0,225,,"<p>and drove on to [[Looking Glass Creek, Nebraska Territory|Lookingglass Creek]] and camped at its mouth for the night upon<br/>
the bank of the [[Loup Fork, Nebraska Territory|Loop Fork]].</p>

<p>After our horses were turned out we were called<br/>
together and in consequence of the disatisfaction of the Indians  a guard of 100<br/>
men was called for. The quorum of the Twelve with nearly the whole<br/>
camp volunteered to stand guard one half of them the forepart of the<br/>
night and the other the latter part. We also had a picket guard of<br/>
five men with their mules at each watch.</p>

<p>I was one of the picket guard. We had<br/>
a hard wind and rain in the afternoon which continued a portion of<br/>
the time that I was on guard. I rolled myself up in my buffalo<br/>
robe and let the wind and rain beat on to me. We were released<br/>
at about 1 o'clock and went to rest; but no Indians appeared <br/>
during the night.</p>

<p>Looking Glass Creek was crossed 15 minutes<br/>
before 9 on the morrow and a westerly course continued and [[Beaver Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Beaver<br/>
Creek]] reached at noon. There was a good many otter on the <br/>
Lookingglass and Beaver about a mile above the mouth of Beaver<br/>
Creek.</p>

<p>Professor [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] took the meridian observation<br/>
of the sun by the sextant for the Lat. which was found to be<br/>
41° 25' 15"". <strike>We also found the magnetic needle to<br/>
vary about 12 degrees east </strike> and also made other observations<br/>
for the time &amp;c.</p>

<p>We crossed ^Beaver^ <strike>Beverer</strike> Creek at half past two o'clock<br/>
travelled seven miles and came to the [[Pawnee Missionary Station, Nebraska Territory|Pawnee Missionary Station]]<br/>
and camped for the night. The Bluff was skirted with some<br/>
oaks on the north side of the road in the hills. We kept out a guard<br/>
through the night as we were in danger of the Sioux on the one<br/>
side and the Pawnees on the other.</p>

<p>While watering the horses at the creek at<br/>
the station this evening brother [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]'s horse mired<br/>
pitched forward and jumped on to him treading upon his feet and</p>",
42658.0,226,1847-04-23,"<p>breast and holding [[George Albert Smith|him]] fast in the mud while I caught the horse by the bit and<br/>
backed him off. I was fearful that brother Smith was badly injured<br/>
but found that he was not.</p>

<p>A Day of Adventures.<br/>
<time datetime=""",04/23/1847
42658.0,226,,""">April the 23</time></p>

<p>The next day was one of adventures to the Pioneer<br/>
company. In the morning 12 of us started on horse back to<br/>
search out a ford across the dangerous and troublesome Loop Fork<br/>
up the Platte River.</p>

<p>We went down the River some distance<br/>
and several men waded across and found the water so deep and <br/>
so much quicksand that we came to the conclusion to drive up<br/>
to the old Pawnee Village. So we returned to the camp and<br/>
harnessed up our horses.</p>

<p>My gray horse named Titus <strike>had the</strike> was sick yet I started out with him and the camp drove<br/>
up with some little difficulty to the old Indian village or a little<br/>
below it and men commenced searching out a ford and found the<br/>
whole bed of the river one body of quicksand into which if a horse<br/>
or waggon stoped it would begin to sink down.</p>

<p>We had two channels of water to cross<br/>
with a sand bar in the middle. The deepest water was from 3<br/>
to 4 feet deep and very rapid and about 300 yards across. At<br/>
some places the quicksand sank both man and beast instantly and<br/>
the more they struggled to get out the more they would sink. Of<br/>
course we avoided such places as much as possible.</p>

<p>As I led the van with my ten being<br/>
the 1st ten it fell to my lot to make the first trial. Professor<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] having a strong pair of horses went forward and I followed<br/>
him. I had two yoke of cattle and my horses on my<br/>
carriage with about ten hundred on it.</p>

<p>As soon as I started I immediately</p>",
42658.0,227,,"<p>saw that the cattle did but little good being slow and in the way. We would stop<br/>
and begin to sink. I jumped out of my carriage into the water up to my<br/>
waist and about ten men came to my assistance with a drag rope and<br/>
hitched it to the oxen and assisted me in getting across the first stream<br/>
though with great difficulty.</p>

<p>We stoped on a sand bar out of the water<br/>
but my horses and waggon began to sink. By treading the ground a little<br/>
it would become a perfect quagmire; yet though we were sinking in it<br/>
the men had to leave the waggon where it was and go to the assistance<br/>
of [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] who in trying to cross the second stream had sunk into<br/>
a bed of quicksand and all the men had to go to his relief to get his horses<br/>
and waggon out. The horses were unhitched from the wagon and<br/>
the load taken out and carried to shore by hand and the waggon drawn<br/>
out by the help of men.</p>

<p>I took off a part of my load in fact most<br/>
of it in a boat and went through the second stream nearly empty and<br/>
got out two other waggons done in the same way but it was so<br/>
terrific an<strike>d</strike> undertaking that the rest of the camp would not follow in <br/>
our track.</p>

<p>So here we found ourselves on the opposite<br/>
side of the River 6 men of us to spend the night together with our horses<br/>
and waggons to guard against the whole Pawnee band then camped<br/>
below us on the same side of the river; and it was supposed they<br/>
numbered 600 warriors. We divided our company making three<br/>
on guard at a time.</p>

<p>Brother [[John Pack|Pack]] Orson Pratt and myself went.<br/>
on guard the forepart of the night. Although I had been in the<br/>
water the whole of the afternoon I stood guard in my wet clothing<br/>
one half of the night and slept in them the other half.</p>

<p>We had not more than got our portion of<br/>
the night through when we were joined by five men from the <br/>
camp who crossed in a boat and were sent by President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
to assist us making eleven of us in all and we divided one force</p>",
42658.0,228,,"<p>accordingly. The night however passed off in peace and ^no^ disturbance from<br/>
hostile Indians.</p>

<p>The morning when it came was pleasant and Professor<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] took <strike>and</strike> ^an^ observation on the south bank of the fording place on the [[Loup Fork, Nebraska Territory|Loop<br/>
Fork]]. <strike>and</strike> The Lattitude was found to be 4^1^<strike>4</strike>° 22' 37""</p>

<p>The camp on the other side were now<br/>
busy in devising plans to cross the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|River]]. They drew together<br/>
timber and rails to build two rafts and began to put it together but<br/>
some of the brethren made another trial to cross with waggons by<br/>
putting on several horse and mule teams.</p>

<p>They went a little higher up than we<br/>
did and got over with much less difficulty and the more the ground<br/>
as trod in the water the smoother and harder it grew. So the<br/>
whole encampment turned their waggons back to the ford and abbandoned<br/>
the raft. By unloading one half of the baggage they could cross<br/>
in safety and the whole came over by doubling teams and by<br/>
going back and forth until all were over each captain with his<br/>
ten assisting each other across. So in this way all Israel<br/>
who were present went over (not Jordan) but the Loop Fork of<br/>
the Platte River in safety without hurt to man or beast and<br/>
they felt thankful to God for his mercies and rejoiced that they<br/>
were on the south side of the river.</p>

<p>We all loaded up our waggons and<br/>
drove 4 miles and camped for the Sabbath on the bank of<br/>
the River and after our waggons were arranged the Twelve took<br/>
a walk on the high table land to make observations with our<br/>
glasses of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Sunday came with a pleasent morning.<br/>
The order of the Pioneer Camp was that there should be no fishing<br/>
hunting nor labour of any kind on The Sabbath except that<br/>
which was absolutely needed.</p>

<p>Four Antelopes appeared before us on<br/>
the plain on the opposite side of the river. We could see them</p>",
42658.0,229,,"<p>with the naked eye but much better through our spyglasses. This was the first<br/>
antelope I ever saw. About 10 o'<u>clock </u> 4 Elk also appeared on the opposite<br/>
side and we viewed them with our glasses and these were the first Elk<br/>
I had ever seen.</p>

<p>After making the Sabbath a day of rest <br/>
both for man and beast until 4 o'<u>clock</u> the Camp gathered together <br/>
for a meeting and were addressed by a number of the brethren; the<br/>
guards were placed out as usual to guard the Camp at night and a company<br/>
of hunters appointed to go forward of the company for game. There<br/>
were 7 horsemen and 10 footmen appointed and the quorum of<br/>
the Twelve had the privilage of joining than when they pleased.</p>

<p>Indian Attacks</p>

<p>Early in the morning before the break of day 2 Indians crept<br/>
upon their hands and knees approaching the camp to steal horses. They<br/>
got within 3 rods of the guard before they were discovered. The guard<br/>
first thought them to be wolves and snapped at them. They rose up and<br/>
ran. Two of the guards fired and 4 others rose up out of the grass.<br/>
The bugle was sounded and all arose to arms not knowing but there was<br/>
a large party near by; but no more were seen there.</p>

<p>I started out in the morning with the Hunters.<br/>
We saw 8 deer &amp; 4 antelopes but caught nothing. Eight miles travel and we<br/>
camped for noon. On the opposite of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] were relics of an old<br/>
Indian town.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we travelled 7 miles and camped<br/>
on [[Clear Creek, Nebraska Territory|Clear Creek]] with a hard gravel bottom the first of the kind we had<br/>
met on the road. We killed one wild goose and saw fresh signs of<br/>
buffalo where we camped being the first we had seen. Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]] and myself went on to a high bluff to view the country.</p>

<p>Just at dusk a tremd^i^ous alarm was<br/>
given through the Camp that Indians had cralled up and taken [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|Porter<br/>
Rockwell]] and his horse and made off with him. Many men mounted</p>",
42658.0,230,,"<p>their horses and made after hime with all speed but it was soon discovered <br/>
that Rockwell was in camp but that two horses were gone<br/>
D<u>r</u> Richard's and brother Little's. About 20 men mounted and<br/>
armed went in search of the horses.</p>

<p>On the morrow we continued our journey<br/>
a south course to try to get on the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte River]] came on to some<br/>
beautiful green grass saw a great quantity of Buffalo signs but<br/>
found no wood nor water. We baited our horses in a green<br/>
valley after 12 miles travel.</p>

<p>Just as we were starting in the afternoon<br/>
we rose unto a small bluff and saw two antelopes in the valley<br/>
before us. Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself were together. Bro<br/>
[[John Brown, b. 1820|Brown]] and another brother was on the other side of the hills and saw<br/>
them. Brother Brown first fired on one and the other man and<br/>
myself fired. We all hit him with our balls but he did<br/>
not fall; we rose up and cut his throat. This was</p>

<p>The First Antelope Killed.</p>

<p>He was dressed and put on board the waggons and we continued on<br/>
and in a short time saw three more at the top of a mound<br/>
looking at us. Brother Brown and myself went after them but<br/>
could not get them <strike>so we:</strike> so we turned about 10 degrees East of<br/>
South and went to the Creek and camped. Our cattle and horses<br/>
were very dry not finding any water through the day.</p>

<p>We had a heavy storm of thunder lightning<br/>
wind and some rain which lasted about an hour. A rifle <strike>ball</strike><br/>
went off in brother Brown's waggon by accident and the ball<br/>
went through a bag of clothes set it on fire then through the<br/>
waggon and broke the leg of a fine horse and the result was<br/>
the breaking up of one of the teams of the Pioneer Company.</p>

<p>Brother [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|Rockwell]] and 3 others had gone<br/>
in the morning again in search of the ho[r]ses which the Indians</p>",
42658.0,231,,"<p>were supposed to have stolen and on the edge of the evening they returned and reported<br/>
that the Indians had stolen them and that they had themselves been attacked by<br/>
15 Indians who were in ambush in the grass. They came upon them<br/>
determined to take their horse from them but the brethren kept them off<br/>
by their rifles and pistols. The Indians were armed with guns<br/>
and bows and when they found that they could not scare the brethren<br/>
they then professed friendship to get to them but the brethren were resolute<br/>
^and determined^ not to move but to fight rather though only 4 to 15. The Indians<br/>
finally rushed upon them to ^catch^ <strike>ketch</strike> the horses by the bits and the brethren<br/>
drew their pistols upon them determined to fire and do their best and the <br/>
Indians seeing their determination broke and ran but fired their guns<br/>
upon the brethren. The balls whistled around them but no one<br/>
was injured. The Brethren did not return the fire not wishing<br/>
to kill any if they could help it.</p>

<p>(28)</p>

<p><u>28</u> Next morning we travelled to [[Grand Island, Hall County, unorganized U.S. Territory|Grand Island]]<br/>
and moved on its banks. I went out with the hunters but we caught<br/>
nothing but a wolf and a goose. We journeyed 6 miles in the <br/>
afternoon and camped on Wood Creek formed a circle put our horses<br/>
inside and had a good defence. We saw plenty of deer run across<br/>
on the Island but President [[Brigham Young|Young]] thought it not prudent to travel up<br/>
the Island hunting lest we should come upon an Indian ambush.</p>

<p><strike>29</strike> 29 A cold morning on the morrow and we started<br/>
at 5 o'clock without feeding drove three miles and breakfasted. The<br/>
hunters went up the Grand Island and found it well supplied with rushes<br/>
and cottonwood. [[Wood Creek, Nebraska Territory|Wood Creek]] was heavily wooded for this country and<br/>
we were beginning to get a good supply of grass for our horses and<br/>
cattle.</p>

<p>We travelled 8 miles and moved and then 10 miles<br/>
farther and camped on the borders of Grand Island which at this place<br/>
was thickly covered with rushes upon which we fed our horses.</p>

<p>I went on to the Island with the hunters<br/>
and saw about 30 antelopes and 8 deer. The antelope would play<br/>
around on the large plains and keep out of our way so that we</p>",
42658.0,232,1847-05-01,"<p>could not shoot them. We shot 4 geese. I shot two of them and one<br/>
deer but did not get the deer.</p>

<p>30 We travelled 16 miles next day and camped<br/>
without wood or water and the grass short affording but little feed.</p>

<p>Our First Buffalo Hunt.<br/>
<time datetime=""",05/01/1847
42658.0,232,,""">May 1st 1847</time></p>

<p>This was an interesting day to the Hunters of the <br/>
Camp of Israel who put out and the camp started on the journey <br/>
before breakfast travelled 6 miles and camped on the prairie in<br/>
sight of</p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Herd</u> <u>of</u> <u>Buffalo</u> <u>Feeding on the Bluff</u> <u>to our</u> <u>right</u><br/>
They were about 200. Three only of the hunters started out after<br/>
them who rode near and left their horses and crawled upon them<br/>
to get a shot but they frightened the herd and they ran away.</p>

<p>A little before the main herd being<br/>
seen three Bulls were discovered on the bluff. [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|OP. Rockwell]] and two<br/>
others went after them and wounded two but got neither.</p>

<p>We had not travelled more than two miles<br/>
farther before we discovered another large herd five miles ahead of<br/>
us. The hunters gathered together and held a council and<br/>
waited until the camp came up. We were determined to get<br/>
some of the Buffalo if possible.</p>

<p>We travelled with the camp until within<br/>
a mile of the herd when a halt was made and 15 hunters<br/>
started out. [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] and myself of the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve were with them. We all travelled together on to the Bluff<br/>
within a few rods of the herd and then divided out. Brother<br/>
[[Thomas Grover|Grover]] and [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] went together into the Bluff; OP. Rockwell<br/>
and brother [[John Brown|Brown]] took the entire left and so we divided into <br/>
companies on the righ left and centre. I was with the company<br/>
in the centre of the herd</p>",
42658.0,233,,"<p>We all made a charge upon them from the Bluffs and<br/>
rushed on to the plain. The herd ran very fast down the ruff bluffs into<br/>
the plain but when we reached the plain we soon overtook them and each<br/>
company singled out its game. We made choice of cows generally; then<br/>
rushed up by the side of them and fired upon them with our pistols<br/>
such as horse pistols &amp; rifle pistols which we found much better to<br/>
carry that rifles which were cumbersome running.</p>

<p>The first we gave chaise to was a Buffalo<br/>
cow with her calf. I rode by the side of her and fired two balls<br/>
which took effect and the other brethren with me also fired until she<br/>
was killed. We cut her throat.</p>

<p>I then ran my horse to the assistance of another<br/>
party who had wounded one and that was also soon dispatched. I<br/>
then saw that [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|O.P. Rockwell]] had three bulls at bay on the prairie and<br/>
Brother [[John Pack|Pack]] and myself ran our horses to his assistance and brother<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] came up at the same time.</p>

<p>We surrounded them and commenced firing<br/>
upon them. They bolted a-head. I put spurs to my horse and<br/>
ran in front and was in about a rod of them when they all pitched<br/>
at me and gave me chase for fight. I had to be quick to get<br/>
out of the way but I soon cleared them. Two broke for the bluff<br/>
and brother [[John Brown|Brown]] put for them but Rockwell Kimball Pack and <br/>
myself stuck to the old bull. I fired 2 balls into him, Bro<br/>
Kimball one and Bro Pack one and the bull fell dead and we<br/>
cut his throat. We also shot a calf that was with him.</p>

<p>By this time the two that had left us and<br/>
after which Brother Brown was gone was more than a mile distant<br/>
in the Bluffs. Brother Kimball and myself gave chase to<br/>
them and when we were within 20 rods of the bluff we saw<br/>
two come out and run for the main herd to which we gave chase<br/>
for awhile but they were fresh and my horse had ran nearly<br/>
ten miles in the chase; so we gave up the pursuit.</p>

<p>I returned to Brother Brown in the Bluff</p>",
42658.0,234,,"<p>and found that one of the bulls to which he gave chase was ^wounded^ <strike>nearly ^dead^ killed</strike><br/>
and had laid down but Brother [[John Brown|Brown]] having no more powder or ball<br/>
before I a<strike>fl</strike>rrived the bull had got up again and ran into the herd on the<br/>
Bluff. So we all returned on our chase ground to gather up the<br/>
meat we had killed being 3 cows ^3^ <strike>one</strike> bull[s] and five calfs making<br/>
eleven in all.</p>

<p>Brother [[Soloman Hancock|Soloman Hancock]] went out in the morning<br/>
to kill buffalo on foot. He did not come in at night and we<br/>
felt concerned about him; but in the morning he returned having<br/>
killed a 3 year old cow and watched her during the night to<br/>
keep the wolves from the eating her. Three wolves came upon<br/>
him. He shot one and the rest ran away.</p>

<p>This made 12 Buffalo in all that<br/>
the Hunters <strike>which</strike> killed on their first day's Buffalo chase and<br/>
we considered this pretty well seeing that we were all strangers to<br/>
the Buffalo hunt and but very few of us had ever seen one before<br/>
in our lives.</p>

<p>We dressed our meat and waggons came<br/>
from the camp to take it in.</p>

<p>A part of our chase was through an immense<br/>
prairie dog town nearly ten miles long and 2 wide with burrows<br/>
nearly at every rod and great danger of the horses steping into<br/>
them and falling. My horse ran into me and was near falling<br/>
but no harm was met by any of the hunters. This was the<br/>
first Buffalo hunt I ever took part in or saw.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday and all were<br/>
busy cooking and saving their meat and in the afternoon we moved<br/>
three miles up for better feed and camped by the side of a large<br/>
slough of water. Our last camping place was at the head of<br/>
[[Grand Island, Hall County, unorganized U.S. Territory|Grand Island]]. Professor [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] took an observation and found it<br/>
to agree with Fremont's observation taken two miles south of our<br/>
camping ground on the south side of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]].</p>

<p>Soon after we camped a herd of</p>",
42658.0,235,,"<p>Buffalo came from the Bluff to the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] to drink within about 2 miles and then<br/>
returned <strike>to the Bluffs</strike>. Some were anxious to go after them but as it was<br/>
Sunday President [[Brigham Young|Young]] thought it best to let them be until to morrow.</p>

<p>The Indians set fire to the prairie before us which<br/>
burned rapidly over a large region of country. Brothers Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] <br/>
and others went in the evening several miles on the road to examine the fire<br/>
and other things.</p>

<p>Monday morning the hunters were called 20 <br/>
in number to go into the Bluff for a still hunt for buffalo and other<br/>
game. We started out with two waggons to bring in the game.</p>

<p>I had taken a severe cold which had settled in<br/>
my side where my bones were broken last fall and it made me sick and<br/>
I was unfit for the hunt yet I started with the Hunters though I<br/>
had jarred myself badly in my hard buffalo chase on Saturday and<br/>
was now feeling its effects.</p>

<p>At the same time the hunters started another<br/>
company was formed to explore the route and see if we could get grass<br/>
for our horses as the Indians had been burning it for several<br/>
days.</p>

<p>When the Hunters reached the bluffs they divided<br/>
into two parties 10 in each and we travelled some 10 miles back and<br/>
forth over the hills and saw no game except antelopes and wolves.</p>

<p>I felt so unwell that I concluded to return to<br/>
camp and [[Amasa Mason Lyman|A Lyman]] and three others were with me. We sat down <br/>
upon the edge of the Bluff in sight of the camp to rest ourselves when<br/>
a company of horsemen approached in haste bearing a red flag. When<br/>
they got within a mile of us we trailed our arms and went down<br/>
to meet them and were informed that the party who had gone up the<br/>
river had come upon an encampent of about 400 Indians warriors<br/>
and a party of about 100 had followed them down a ravine to cut<br/>
of their retreat. We went into the camp.</p>

<p>The horsemen had come to call in the Hunters<br/>
and in their return they came across a herd of Buffalo and they</p>",
42658.0,236,,"<p>brought into camp three calves and 4 antelope.</p>

<p>There was a good guard during the night kept and<br/>
early in the morning the cannon was fired twice to let the Indians know that we<br/>
were awake. I had a very severe night with my side.</p>

<p>We started on our journey in the morning <br/>
five ^waggons^ <strike>agons</strike> abreast making five roads. This was to be in readiness<br/>
in case of an attack from Indians.</p>

<p>We travelled 3 miles and saw some waggons<br/>
on the opposite side of the river going down the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]]. Soon one of<br/>
the men waded the river and came to see us to know who we were.<br/>
He informed us they were traders from [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Laramie]] that they<br/>
were 16 days from that place the grass good on the South side<br/>
but burned up on the North side by the Indians. He would take<br/>
letters for us to [[Mr. Sarpee|Sarpee]] who lived near [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]]; so the<br/>
camp stoped and wrote 52 letters to our families.</p>

<p>I was ahead of the company with <br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] taking observations and did not know of the matter<br/>
until the time was nearly up and I then in great hast scribbled<br/>
a few lines to my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]. An epistle was written to the<br/>
Church and three brethren accompanied the Frenchman across<br/>
the Platte to the other men of <strike>t</strike> his company <strike>who were</strike> 9 in all<br/>
who informed the brethren that they had not seen an Indian<br/>
since they left Laramie that there was a ferry at the fort &amp;<br/>
and agreed to take our letters safe.</p>

<p>We drove on three miles farther and<br/>
bailed our teams until the brethren returned from the French<br/>
traders when they made a report to the camp of what was said<br/>
to them. A council of the whole company of Pioneers was<br/>
then called to decide whether we should cross the Platt or continue<br/>
up the North side.</p>

<p>We were convinced that it would be better<br/>
for us as a company to cross the river on to the old travelling<br/>
road to Laramie as there was good grass on that side</p>",
42658.0,237,,"<p>while the Indians were burning it all off on the North side of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] where<br/>
we were travelling; but when we took into consideration the situation of the next companies<br/>
and the thousands who would follow after and as we were the Pioneers and had<br/>
not our wives and children with us we thought it best to keep on the North<br/>
side of the River and brave the difficulties of burning prairies. Thus<br/>
a road would be made that should stand as a permanent route for the<br/>
Saints independant of the old emigration route and the River would<br/>
seperate the emigrant companies that they need not quarrel for wood<br/>
grass or water and when our next company should come along the<br/>
grass would be much better than on the south side as it would grow<br/>
by that time.</p>

<p>These were the views that the Pioneers assembled<br/>
in a mass council took and the vote was called and it was unanimously<br/>
resolved to go on the North side of the river. So the camp again<br/>
moved on; but during the moving Col. [[Stephen Markham|Markham]] drilled the men<br/>
in a military capacity and they unshiped the cannon and carried<br/>
it on wheels.</p>

<p>The Frenchman informed us that he never saw<br/>
so many buffalo on the route before as this season and that they had to<br/>
stop several times to let the herds pass. We saw many deer<br/>
and antelope this day and a few buffalo and at night camped<br/>
near a herd but a short distance from us. It was also afterwards<br/>
found that the alarm of the 3rd about the 400 Indian warriors was<br/>
a false one and that a man had been frightened by a herd of antelope<br/>
supposing them in the distance to be Indians.</p>

<p>The change from salt to fresh meat was<br/>
affecting many in the camp.</p>

<p>In the morning we had to keep a guard out to<br/>
prevent a herd of buffalo from mixing up with our cattle. Two bulls<br/>
at noon were approaching our herd of cows and men had to go out and<br/>
drive them off. In the afternoon the brethren killed one<br/>
cow and 5 calves and brought in a bull calf alive with the intentions<br/>
of raising it. It would try hard to bunt the men and dogs over</p>",
42658.0,238,,"<p>and some got hard raps. It was dead however the next day.</p>

<p>We stoped for the night but found the grass on<br/>
fire and had to return back one mile and camped on the bank of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] on<br/>
a spot that was just burned over except small patches. Some took their <br/>
horses on to an Island near by and cut down cottonwood for feed.</p>

<p>We started early next morning without feeding<br/>
(excepting a little corn) as there was no grass; travelled three miles and <br/>
left <strike>it</strike> in our rear the fire and breakfasted on a good spot of grass.</p>

<p>This morning the herds of buffalo speck both<br/>
sides of the river and the antelope was in great abundance some of which<br/>
would run into the camp. A young buffalo calf also came in and<br/>
followed us and we gave them some milk and left him.</p>

<p>We continued our journey seeing many <br/>
herds of buffalo &amp; antelope and one large herd of Elk. Two antelopes<br/>
were killed this morning but as there was so much meat in camp<br/>
it was thought best not to kill many more game until we needed it.</p>

<p>Dr [[Willard Richards|Richards]] [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and myself <br/>
walked up quite near several herds of Buffalo and examined them through <br/>
our glasses. They were shedding their coats. One bull had a mass<br/>
of wool swin[g]ing by his side like a loose robe.</p>

<p>Our herd of cows started to run among <br/>
the Buffalo but President [[Brigham Young|Young]] galloped his horse to separate them <br/>
and had great difficulty in doing so. He lost a spyglass in the chase<br/>
worth 40 dollars. The brethren hunted a long time for it but <br/>
could not find it.</p>

<p>We continued our journey among the herds <br/>
of buffalo and were not out of sight of them at all and they had <br/>
eaten the grass to such a degree that there was little remaining for <br/>
our cattle and timber also we not but seldom met. We camped at<br/>
night near a heard of buffalo that reached as far as our eyes could<br/>
extent. This day the camp made 20 miles.</p>

<p>Next day I should judge we saw ten <br/>
thousand buffalo and came near one large herd with an unusual</p>",
42658.0,239,,"<p>number of calves yearlings and two years old. We saw several large ones mired<br/>
dead wolves had commenced eating some. Wolves on every hand were seen<br/>
following the herd to eat those who died by wounds &amp;c.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and others rode out in the evening a<br/>
few miles to search out the road. There was some rain.</p>

<p>The next morning was a pleasant morning and not<br/>
so cold and windy as the day before. A start was not made until 10 o'clock<br/>
as the teams needed rest and feed bad. I rode forward to day with the Twelve<br/>
and others and the sights of buffalo that our eyes beheld was most astonishing.<br/>
Thousands upon thousands would crowd together as they came from the bluffs<br/>
to the bottom land to go to the river and sloughs to drink until the river<br/>
and land upon both sides of it looked as though the face of the earth was<br/>
alive and moving like the waves of the sea. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] remarked<br/>
that he had heard many buffalo tales told but never expected to behold<br/>
what his eyes now saw. The half had not been told him.</p>

<p>When we stoped at noon many of the<br/>
buffalo walked along beside our waggons so that it would have been<br/>
easy to shoot them down. [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|O. P. Rockwell]] did shoot one through<br/>
the neck and she droped dead. It was a two year old heffer and good<br/>
meat. We had great difficulty in keeping our cattle and horses<br/>
from going among the herds and if they had got mixed it would have<br/>
been almost impossible to have ever got them again.</p>

<p>We travelled 11 1/4 miles this day until we<br/>
came to the bluffs that made down to the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|River]] and there we camped for<br/>
the night. Brother [[William Clayton|William Clayton]] had prepared a mile gage on<br/>
the hind wheel of his waggon so that the distance could be measured.</p>

<p>Brigham Young H. C. Kimball [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A Smith]] and myself went on to the highest bluffs near and took a<br/>
survey of the surrounding country without glasses; and the scene<br/>
before us north east and west as far as our vision extended looked<br/>
as rough as the sea in a storm with the ridges and valleys mostly<br/>
sand and scarcely any green thing upon it excepting a little scattering<br/>
grass and the Spanish soap root which the Mexicans use for washing</p>",
42658.0,240,1847-05-08,"<p>The top resembles a pineapple &amp; I brought in one root 24 inches long and<br/>
two in diamater. I pounded a little of it and found that it would fill<br/>
a dish with suds like soap.</p>

<p>On Sunday the <time datetime=""",05/08/1847
42658.0,240,,""">9</time>th as we had no feed around <sup>us</sup> our<br/>
teams passed across the bluffs 4 miles and camped for the day. I<br/>
wrote two letters one to brother [[James Ferguson|Ferguson]] and the other to Brother [[James Bevin|Bevin]]<br/>
for brother <strike>[[John Mills Woolley|Wolsey]]</strike> ^Wolsey^ to take with him to <strike>[[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Pueblo]]</strike> ^Pueblo^. We had a<br/>
meeting and a good one. The Spirit of God ruled over the camp.<br/>
Peace quietness and contentment pervaded almost every breast.</p>

<p>The Twelve met and it was thought<br/>
best not for the brethren to start for Pueblo until they arrived<br/>
at [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]]. I rode with the Twelve and others 4 miles<br/>
up the river and saw large herds of buffalo come to water.</p>

<p>Monday morning was cool. Before leaving<br/>
the camp ground a letter was written to the next camp which<br/>
should follow put into a small box nailed to a post 12 feet<br/>
long one end of which was planted firmly in the ground and<br/>
standing as a guide board with the following words inscribed:<br/>
""Open this box and you will find a letter; 316 miles to Winter<br/>
Quarters; Pioneers; Lattitude 41°. Our friends we had<br/>
no doubt would be glad to get the letter as it contained an account<br/>
of our journey.</p>

<p>We travelled 6 miles and nooned and then<br/>
travelled 4 more and camped for the night. Our teams was<br/>
week in consequence of there being no grass for several<br/>
days. It being eaten all up. There was one buffalo—one<br/>
deer and one hare brought into camp to day by the Hunters<br/>
which was distributed among the company. We had what<br/>
fresh meat we wanted daily.</p>

<p>The grass we found somewhat better<br/>
to day and we met but few buffalo but passed through<br/>
some miles of dead grass which we burned to give new<br/>
feed to the next company. It made a great fire indeed</p>",
42658.0,241,,"<p>The Hunting Ground of the Sioux</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we found ourselves travelling<br/>
over the hunting ground of the Sioux. Some 8 or ten days prior there<br/>
had been a large band there of from 500 to 1000. This we judged from<br/>
the signs around us. They had taken the brains out of the large<br/>
buffalo their hides generally and some of the meat and had broken<br/>
up the bones for the marrow. One Hundred calves we found<br/>
dead in one place with nothing taken but the tongues legs to<br/>
their knees and entrails. At another place 35 calves were<br/>
found dead and washed in heaps where the buffalo had been chased<br/>
across <strike>the</strike> the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] and had ran over the calves in rising the bank<br/>
of the river.<br/>
I found on the bluff their medicine bag<br/>
tied to a stick 6 feet long struck up in the bank; also a saddle<br/>
tied to a large buffalo dung I supposed to show the next party which<br/>
way the buffalo had gone.</p>

<p>I had left my horse to feed in the valley<br/>
while I went on the Bluff to view the country and he started off<br/>
not seeing the camp took the back track and I had to run after<br/>
him and in doing this I ran through the great encampment of<br/>
the Sioux where their lodges had been on their hunting expedition.<br/>
Here I left my gun and followed my horse until I overtook<br/>
him &amp; with the assistance of brother [[John Sherman Fowler|Fowler]] who came out of the<br/>
encampment I stoped him and rode back got my gun and<br/>
examined the ground and judged that there had been five hundred<br/>
lodges. There were acres of ground covered with buffalo<br/>
wool where they had dressed their skins buffalo wolf &amp;c<br/>
I brought in a good dressed white wolf skin.</p>

<p>Many of the brethren went out the next<br/>
day to visit the Indian encampment and brought in parts<br/>
of robes leather &amp;c which had been left.</p>",
42658.0,242,,"<p>We travelled to day eleven miles. The bluffs<br/>
for the first time on the North Fork came bald to the river so that<br/>
we had to go over the bluffs with our waggons.</p>

<p>There is one thing concerning the [[Platte River, Nebraska Territory|Platt River]]<br/>
worthy of note. It is much of the way a mile in width generally<br/>
covered with water but very shallow. When the south wind blows<br/>
hard the water all rushes to the north shore so that one would<br/>
suppose there was a great rise in the tide but let the wind shift<br/>
and blow hard from the north and the water immediately<br/>
recedes from the north shore until one can walk across two<br/>
thirds of the River on bare ground. Thus the River constantly<br/>
ebbs and flows like the tide according to the wind.</p>

<p>Early next morning I went out to hunt<br/>
Buffalo returned to breakfast and started out agian with [[Phineas Howe Young|Phineas<br/>
Young]]. I got lost among the Bluffs but found my way out<br/>
again. Brother Phineas shot a buck antelope and I carried<br/>
him into camp. There were three antelopes and one buffalo<br/>
killed.</p>

<p>Some of the hunters thought they heard Indian<br/>
guns during the night on the opposite side of the river. An<br/>
Indian cralled up to a pair of mules that were tied together and<br/>
made a grab at them but the mules sprang and got away<br/>
One of the gards shot at him and he ran. All the horses<br/>
were then brought into the circle of our camp and the cannon<br/>
prepared for firing but seeing no one it was not fired.</p>

<p>A large number of barefoot tracks<br/>
were seen next morning supposed to be of the Indians who came<br/>
down last night to steal our horses. We travelled eight<br/>
miles during the day: in the morning our road was over the<br/>
Bluffs with cold North wind and rain but we had the best grass<br/>
we had found on the road. We camped on the prairie. I<br/>
went out with some others to hunt got within about 30 rods<br/>
of the Buffalo and shot at the neck of one. The ball entered</p>",
42658.0,243,1847-05-16,"<p>his shoulder and crippled him but he hobbled away with the herd. There were a number<br/>
of hunters among the herds and one of them killed a fat buffalo which was<br/>
brought into camp.</p>

<p>Sunday the <time datetime=""",05/16/1847
42658.0,243,,""">16</time>th was still cloudy and a cold wind. With<br/>
Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|Rockwell]] and [[Roswell Stephens|Stephens]] I rode 4 miles<br/>
over the Bluffs to pick out a road for the Pioneers to get again on the<br/>
bottom land. We had a good meeting in the afternoon; and the<br/>
laws of the camp were read. One of the brethren had shot an<br/>
antelope and a buffalo which was against the rules of the camp<br/>
to go hunting on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Monday was warm and pleasant but our road<br/>
was hard: two and a half miles through land bluffs when we again<br/>
struck the bottom 4 1/2 miles from our last camping place.<br/>
The hunters brought in 3 buffalo which detained the camp sometime<br/>
to get and President Young was not pleased with it as we had<br/>
so much meat in camp. We saw large droves of deer in the<br/>
bottoms more than we had seen before. A young fawn was picked<br/>
up and brought into camp. I led the company of Pioneers<br/>
mostly through the bluffs in the morning before brothers Young<br/>
and Kimball came up when we rode together all day<br/>
picking out the road.</p>

<p>The camp was called together next day<br/>
and President Young sharply reproved the hunters for shooting<br/>
so much meat detaining the camp and for taking more life<br/>
than necessary and also the horsemen for their indifference in<br/>
picking out the road. He said there were but two who had<br/>
manifested any interest in helping him get the camp along<br/>
Afterwards the horsemen went forward to pick out the road instead<br/>
of going hunting and I did not hear a gun fired during the day.</p>

<p>The following day we met the worst<br/>
sand hill on the journey and what made it worse was that the<br/>
rain was pouring down upon us continually; and we had more rain<br/>
during the day and evening than ever before on our route. I rode</p>",
42658.0,244,,"<p>forward during the day in the rain picking out the road. We travelled<br/>
eight miles.</p>

<p>Next morning seven miles were made and<br/>
we moved opposite [[Ash Creek, Nebraska Territory|Ash Creek]] on the South side of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] where<br/>
the [[Oregon Trail, Nebraska Territory|Origon]] raod first strikes the North fork of the Platt. Several<br/>
of the brethren went over in the boat which we were taking along<br/>
to examine the rocky bluffs road creek &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we travelled 8 3/4 miles<br/>
and camped for the night. We had a very good road most of the day<br/>
on the bank of the river. There was a good bit of rock bluff on<br/>
both sides of the river and some on the South side was formed into<br/>
natural terraces rotundas squares &amp;c from 50 to a hundred feet<br/>
high and looked like good foundations for forts fortifications and strong<br/>
holds. They resemble the works of art and look something like<br/>
the old castles of [[England|England]] and [[Scotland|Scotland]]. They were level on the<br/>
top. There is a beautiful Cedar Island in the river a<br/>
short distance above Ash Creek which is a good landmark to<br/>
show travellers where the Oregon road strikes the river.</p>

<p>Before we left the encampment next<br/>
morning Bro [[William Clayton|Clayton]] put up a guide board for the benefit of<br/>
the next company bearing the inscription, ""From [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]]<br/>
409 miles; from the Junction 93 1/4 [[Cedar Bluffs, Saunders County, Nebraska Territory|Cedar Bluff]] 36 1/2<br/>
[[Ash Hollow, Garden County, Nebraska Territory|Ash Hollow]] 8 miles and 133 from [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Laramie]].""</p>

<p>We travelled 7 1/2 miles and nooned and<br/>
eight more and camped for the night. I killed a bagger with<br/>
the jaw bone of a buffalo.</p>

<p>Just as we got to our camping place two<br/>
Indians came from the Bluffs riding towards us and made signs for<br/>
us to come to them. Several of the brethren went. It was<br/>
a Sioux Indian and his squaw. They talked by signs and<br/>
went away.</p>

<p>Our road was very straight on the morrow's<br/>
travel but we came over 2 1/2 miles of the worst sand hill that we</p>",
42658.0,245,1847-05-23,"<p>had passed. The bluffs on our route today presented the most singular natural<br/>
scenery I had ever beheld in all my travels. It had the appearance of the<br/>
old walls and ruins of the castles of [[Europe|Europe]]. The brethren found a part of<br/>
a petrified leg bone of a mammoth. It was from the knee joint downwards<br/>
was 17 inches long and 11 wide and weighed 27 lbs.</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday the <time datetime=""",05/23/1847
42658.0,245,,""">23</time>rd. In company<br/>
with Brigham [[Brigham Young|Young]] and the Twelve I visited the top of the highest bluff<br/>
ruins that lie opposite our encampment which was truly a curiosity. We<br/>
had a fair view of [[Chimney Rock, Nebraska Territory|Chimney Rock]] from where we were. I carried a bleached<br/>
Buffalo's head on the top and we wrote upon it our names and distance<br/>
from several places. [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] took a Barometrical observation on<br/>
the solitary cedar tree on the top of the bluff ruins.</p>

<p>The camp met at half past eleven in the<br/>
morning for Sabbath services. [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] addressed the meeting<br/>
followed by President Young who said he was satisfied that the<br/>
Lord was with us and leading us. He had never seen a company<br/>
of people more united than the camp had been thus far on the journey;<br/>
that we should pluck the fruit of this mission to all eternity; that<br/>
he had many things to teach us but could not do it only in a stake<br/>
of Zion; but he was well satisfied with himself his brethren the Twelve<br/>
and the camp at large. One thing he would say to the praise of<br/>
all and that was that not one had refused to obey his council on the<br/>
road. His peace with God was continually like a river and he felt<br/>
that the fruit of peace rested upon the whole camp.</p>

<p>Several others spoke and the meeting was then<br/>
dismissed.</p>

<p>We intended to have rode out in the evening but<br/>
saw that a storm was gathering. It began to blow very hard and<br/>
it was as much as we could do to save our waggon bows and covers<br/>
from being smashed. It continued for about an hour and then<br/>
rained for another hour accompanied by hail. I covered all my horses<br/>
with all the blankets I could get and got up several times in the night<br/>
to see them. It rained occasionaly and the horses shook with cold but</p>",
42658.0,246,,"<p>morning came and all was alive again and we continued our journey</p>

<p>As soon as we camped at noon two Indians<br/>
came to the camp. They were Sioux and well dressed and clean. We<br/>
gave them dinner and they left.</p>

<p>We camped at night near the quicksand<br/>
mountain making 16 1/2 miles that day. I rode about two<br/>
miles forward to find grass and a camping ground and on my<br/>
return saw about 30 Sioux plunge their horses into the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] on<br/>
the opposite side and make towards us. I rode with several<br/>
others to the river and met them as they came out. They shook<br/>
hands with us very friendly. The chief unfurled a large American<br/>
flag with the Eagle stars and stripes and presented me a letter,<br/>
written in French which we however made out. They were all<br/>
well dressed and the chief was in a military coat. The brethren<br/>
brought a white flag and planted it by the side of theirs. They wanted to go into camp. We proposed<br/>
for five of them to go and the rest to remain but they all wanted<br/>
to go so we let them and gave them supper. They remained in camp all<br/>
night but were good and stole nothing.</p>

<p>Some little trading was done with the<br/>
Sioux next morning and we gave them breakfast. They behaved well and<br/>
when we started crossed the river. I had to keep my carriage today<br/>
having the rheumatism in shoulders &amp; back and teeth ache.</p>

<p>We nooned next day in good grass 2 miles<br/>
above [[Chimney Rock, Nebraska Territory|Chimney Rock]] and I rode <strike>to day</strike> with brothers [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] to look out the road. By an imperfect measurement by a<br/>
trigonometrical observation by the sextant Professor [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] made<br/>
Chimney Rock to be 260 feet above the level of the river.</p>

<p>A Panic Among our Teams</p>

<p>Just before camping at noon while travelling on<br/>
a smooth Prairie an Indian horse that was bought of the Sioux<br/>
ran away with a singletree at his heals and gave a tremendous</p>",
42658.0,247,,"<p>fright to the cows oxen and horses and in an instant a dozen or more waggons<br/>
were darting by each other like lightning and the horses and mules flying as<br/>
it were over the ground some turning to the right and some to the left and<br/>
some ran into other waggons. The horses and mules that brother [[John Sherman Fowler|Fowler]]<br/>
was driving leaped with all speed <strike>with</strike> he holding the bits and brother [[Jesse Carter Little|Little]]<br/>
the lines darted by my carriage like electricity and came within one inch<br/>
of a collision with my wheels which would have made a wreck. Another<br/>
waggon with a pair of mules and one yoke of cattle dashed by which would<br/>
also have smashed my carriage had they looked. By this time my<br/>
own horses started to run but was held by the driver. Fowlers waggon<br/>
continued regardless of rough or smooth ground about 50 rods be ^being^ draged<br/>
the whole distance by the bit which was the case with many others<br/>
but all were soon stoped and returned to their lines without accident<br/>
which appeared truly a miracle. A person can hardly conceive the<br/>
power manifested by anamals especially mules in such a fright<br/>
and it gave us some idea what an Indian yell would do in a camp<br/>
with teams hitched to waggons.</p>

<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself picked the road<br/>
during our journey of the following <strike>morning</strike> ^morning^ and in the afternoon I piloted<br/>
as straight as any road yet made on the whole route and picked out a camping<br/>
ground on the bank of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] in good feed.</p>

<p>It showed he understood that we were pioneering<br/>
a road for the whole House of Israel to travel in for many a year<br/>
to come and therefore that it required the greatest care in marking<br/>
the route.</p>

<p>A cold rainy morning followed and we<br/>
concluded not to start until it stoped so we remained till 10 o'clock<br/>
and travelled 11 1/2 miles and camped for the night.</p>

<p>During the evening President [[Brigham Young|Young]] called<br/>
at my fire and seeing several brethren playing dominoes in a waggon<br/>
near by he began to teach saying that the Devil was getting power<br/>
over the camp which had for several days given way to cards<br/>
dominoes &amp;c and that if they did not spedily repent their works</p>",
42658.0,248,,"<p>labours and journey would be in vain. [[Brigham Young|He]] said that to be sure the camp<br/>
didin't quarrel for the Devil would not set them at that as long as he<br/>
could draw them gradually away from duty and fill them with<br/>
nonsense and folly for the Devil was very cunning in winning away<br/>
the people of God. I felt the force of his remarks.</p>

<p>During the evening I went into Dr [[Willard Richards|Richard's]]<br/>
waggon and read a chapter in the Book of Mormon and prayed with<br/>
them after which President Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] Willard Richards<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] and Wilford Woodruff met in council in brother Brigham's<br/>
waggon and President Young wrote some of the word of the Lord<br/>
concerning the camp and expressed his views and feelings; that<br/>
they must spedily repent or they would be cursed that they were<br/>
forgetting their mission and that he would rather travel with ten<br/>
righteous men who would keep the commandments of God than<br/>
the whole camp while in a carless manner and forgetting<br/>
God. We stayed together till ten o'clock</p>

<p>The Pioneers Chastised</p>

<p>Next morning President Young called the camp<br/>
together and required each captain seperately to call out his men and when<br/>
all were present except two who had gone out hunting he addressed<br/>
them something near in the following words:</p>

<p>""I think I will take as my text to<br/>
preach my sermon from—<u>I am about to revolt from travelling<br/>
with this camp any farther with the Spirit they now possess.</u></p>

<p>""I had rather risk myself among the savages<br/>
with ten men who are men of faith—men of mighty prayer—men of<br/>
God than to be with this whole camp when they forget God and<br/>
turn their hearts to folly and wickedness yea I would rather be<br/>
alone and I am now resolved not to go any father with the<br/>
camp unless you will covenant to humble yourselves before<br/>
the Lord and serve Him and cease your folly and wickedness</p>",
42658.0,249,,"<p>For a week past nearly the whole camp has been card playing and checkers and<br/>
dominoes have occupied the attention of the brethren and dancing and nigering<br/>
and hooing down all has been the test continually.</p>

<p>Now it is time to quit it. There has been<br/>
trials and lawsuits upon every nonsensical thing and if this is suffered to<br/>
go on it will not be but a short time before you are fighting ^knocking^ <strike>mowing</strike> each<br/>
other down and taking life. It is high time it was stoped.</p>

<p>I do not want to hear anymore such reports <br/>
as I heard last Sunday of men going to meeting and preaching to the<br/>
rest after playing cards until meeting time. You are a pretty set of<br/>
men going to look out a location among the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|mountains]] for a resting<br/>
place for the Saints even the whole Church of God who have been<br/>
driven out from the Gentiles and rejected of them. And after you<br/>
have established a location you are then going out to preach the<br/>
Gospel <u>and</u> seal salvation upon the House of Israel and gather the nations.</p>

<p>How would you look if they should know <br/>
your conduct and ask you what you did when you went to seek out<br/>
Zion and find a resting place for the Saints where the standard of<br/>
the Kingdom of God could be reared and her banners unfurled <strike>for</strike><br/>
for the nations to gather unto?</p>

<p>""Did you spend a good deal of your time<br/>
in dancing pitching quoit jumping wrestling and the like? Yes, yes.<br/>
Did you play cards dice checkers dominoes? O! Yes.</p>

<p>What <strike>y</strike>could you do with yourselves?<br/>
Why you would think from the glance of the eyes of God angels and<br/>
men even wicked men. Then are you not ashamed of yourselves<br/>
for practising these things? Yes you are, and you must quit<br/>
it.""</p>

<p>After speaking somewhat lengthy upon these<br/>
matters President Young called Twelve together and the High<br/>
Priests Seventies and Elders and there was found to be eight of<br/>
the quorum of the Twelve 18 High Priests 80 Seventies and<br/>
eight Elders.</p>",
42658.0,250,,"<p>After this was done President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said unto the<br/>
Twelve—</p>

<p>""I[f] you are willing to humble yourselves before the Lord<br/>
and covenant to do right and walk humbly before Him make<br/>
it manifest by raising the right hand.""</p>

<p>Then each one raised his hand and<br/>
the same question was put to the High Priests Seventies Elders and<br/>
Members and all universally covenentted with uplifted hands to<br/>
humble themselves before the Lord repent of their sins and keep<br/>
His commandments.</p>

<p>President Young then spoke of those who<br/>
were not in the Church as there was some present. They would<br/>
be protected in their rights but they must not introduce wickedness<br/>
into the camp for it would not be suffered. He also spoke<br/>
of the standard and ensign that would be reared in Zion.</p>

<p>Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] followed and said that<br/>
the words of President Young was as the word of the Lord unto<br/>
him and just as binding us though it was a written revelation<br/>
and it was just as binding upon the whole camp as it was<br/>
upon him and he urged the Pioneers to give heed to the teachings<br/>
that had been given.</p>

<p>[[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]] remarked that if the Saints had<br/>
leasure hours they could spend them at much better advantage then in<br/>
playing cards as there was a world of knowledge and science to be<br/>
obtained and every moment should be improved in storing the mind<br/>
with some good principle. And he acknowledged the teachings we <br/>
had received to be of the Lord.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff said: ""A burned<br/>
child dreaded the fire. He had not forgotten his journey in<br/>
the camp of Zion in 1834 and should he live to the age of<br/>
[[Methuselah (OT)|Methusalah]] he should not forget the hour when the Prophet and<br/>
Seer [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] stood upon the waggon wheel and addressed<br/>
that camp and said that because they had not hearkened unto</p>",
42658.0,251,1847-05-30,"<p>unto [[Joseph Smith Jr.|his]] counsel but disobeyed and transgressed from time to time judgement must<br/>
come and that we should be visited by the Destroying Angels. And so we<br/>
were and more than twenty of our members fell by the stroke and we<br/>
all suffered much in our feelings. I pray the Lord I may not see another<br/>
such a time; and I would now advise my brethren to be careful in<br/>
keeping the <strike>counsel</strike> ^covenant^ we have made lest by and by the word of the Lord came<br/>
unto us as in the days of [[Joseph (OT)|Joseph]] and we cannot escape His judgement.<br/>
I would advise all the brethren who have got cards and the like to from<br/>
them for if you keep the covenants you have made you will have no<br/>
time to use them and if you keep them for your children they will only<br/>
prove a curse to them. My prayer to God is that we may all be<br/>
enabled to keep our covenants with the Lord and each other. I rejoice<br/>
that the watchman in our midst are quick to comprehend and warn of<br/>
evil and reprove us when wrong that we may be saved and do the<br/>
will of God.</p>

<p>Brother [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and myself went<br/>
together to pilot out the road. We travelled 8 1/2 miles and camped for the <br/>
night in good feed.</p>

<p>Day of Prayer and Fasting<br/>
Sunday <time datetime=""",05/30/1847
42658.0,251,,""">30</time>th</p>

<p>We set this Sabbath apart for prayer and fasting.<br/>
In the morning I shaved cleansed my body put on clean<br/>
clothing &amp; read a chapter in the Book of Mormon humbled myself<br/>
before the Lord and poured out my soul in prayer before ^Him^ <strike>the Lord</strike><br/>
and His Spirit descended upon me and I was blessed and prepared for<br/>
the service of the day and then I spent some time in writing<br/>
in my Journal.</p>

<p>The camp had a prayer meeting in the<br/>
morning and met again for public meeting. President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] with the Quorum of the Twelve and a few others went<br/>
into the valley of the hills and prayed according to the order of the</p>",
42658.0,252,1847-06-01,"<p>Priesthood. [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|Porter]] and Brother [[Albert Carrington|Carrington]] watched to see that no Indians<br/>
came upon us. We had a good time. There was a heavy shower<br/>
storm appeared but it mostly went around and there was but little<br/>
rain where we were.</p>

<p>We returned to our waggons took some<br/>
refreshment having eaten nothing all day and soon the sun came<br/>
out pleasantly and in the evening I went out two miles with the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve into a high bluff and we had a good view<br/>
of the [[Black Hills, Nebraska Territory|Black Hills]] and also engaged in prayers.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we camped<br/>
opposite [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Laramie]]. This was <time datetime=""",06/01/1847
42658.0,252,1847-06-02,""">June the 1</time>st.</p>

<p>When we arrived we saw some men<br/>
approaching us from the Fort and found them to be a part of the<br/>
company of [[Mississippi|Missisippi]] brethren who had been to Pueblo through<br/>
the Winter. Brother [[Robert Crow|Crow]] and his family 7 waggons and<br/>
14 souls were the persons who were at Fort Laramie. He<br/>
informed us that the remainder of the Missisippi company with<br/>
the portion of the Mormon Battalion at [[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Pueblo]] would start from Laramie<br/>
about the 1st of June and follow our trail; told us of 4 of the brethren<br/>
who had died and had heard nothing of the main body of the<br/>
Battalion.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] suggested the propriety of<br/>
of our leaving all our ploughs at the Fort except such as we need to<br/>
use immediately when we got to our destination and also to do<br/>
our blacksmithing mending waggons &amp;c as soon as possible so that we<br/>
might go on our journey speedily. A company company was appointed<br/>
to attend to the herding and these branches of business.</p>

<p><time datetime=""",06/02/1847
42658.0,252,,""">June the 2</time>nd in company with the Twelve<br/>
and others I crossed the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] to visit the Fort. We examined<br/>
[[Fort John, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort St John]] which was now evacuated but the walls were still standing<br/>
The dimensions of Fort St John were 144 by 132 outside and inside contained<br/>
16 rooms. The largest on the North side was 98 feet long 47 wide<br/>
The [[Oregon Trail, Nebraska Territory|Oregon trail]] ran one rod from S. W. corner of the fort.</p>",
42658.0,253,,"<p>We next visited [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Laramie]] then occupied by 38 persons<br/>
mostly French who have married the Sioux. [[Mr. Burdow|Mr Burdow]] was the superintendant.<br/>
This fort was 168 by 116 outside with 6 rooms inside. It was quite a pleasant<br/>
situation for a fort.</p>

<p>Mr Burdow was a Frenchman. He received us kindly<br/>
and invited us into a large setting room and gave us all the information<br/>
he could in relation to our route and furnished us with his flat bottom boat<br/>
on reasonable terms to assist us in ferrying the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|Platte]]. He informed us<br/>
that Gov. [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]] and his men had much to say against the Mormons and<br/>
cautioned him to take care of his horses and cattle &amp;c lest we should<br/>
steal them and tried to prejudice him all he could against us. Burdow<br/>
said that Boggs company was quarreling all the time and most of <strike>his</strike> them<br/>
had deserted him. He finally told Boggs and company that let the Mormons<br/>
be what they might they could not be worse than he and his men.</p>

<p>After conversing with Mr Burdow a length of<br/>
time we got into the flat bottom boat about 20 of us and went down the<br/>
Laramie Fork to its mouth about 2 miles and up the Platte 1/2 a mile<br/>
to our camp. After dinner we met in council and decided that<br/>
[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] should go to [[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Pueblo]] with several other brethren to<br/>
meet the detachment of the Battalion that was there and for them<br/>
to come as soon as convenient to Laramie and follow our trail.</p>

<p>A very windy day followed but we commenced<br/>
before sunrise to ferry over our boats. My ten was the first that went<br/>
over.</p>

<p>We set up our blacksmiths shops in the old fort<br/>
to do our work and made fires to do our washing.</p>

<p>In the evening the Twelve and others went on to<br/>
the highest peak to view the surrounding country and on our return<br/>
we visited the Indian and French burying ground. The Indians were<br/>
laid upon a staging about 10 feet from the ground but the French<br/>
buried in the ground with crosses at their head being Catholics<br/>
and strong pickets around their burying place.</p>

<p>I wrote letters to Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]</p>",
42658.0,254,1847-06-04,"<p>[[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] and [[John Benbow|J. Benbow]] and left them in the hands of Mr [blank] who<br/>
kept the store and acted as Post Master. He said he would forward our letters<br/>
for [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] to the care of [[Mr. Sarpee|Mr Sarpee]]</p>

<p>Before we left the [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|fort]] Bro [[William Clayton|Clayton]] erected<br/>
a guide board on the North side for the next company.</p>

<p>We started on our journey again on the <time datetime=""",06/04/1847
42658.0,254,1847-06-06,""">4</time>th<br/>
and the route began to be attended with considerable interest of scenery as<br/>
we commenced the assent into the [[Black Hills, Nebraska Territory|Black Hills]].</p>

<p>Brother [[Robert Crow|Robert Crow]] had joined us which<br/>
added to our company 9 men 5 women 3 children 6 waggons 13<br/>
yoke of oxen 20 cows 3 bulls ten young cattle and horses which<br/>
made our whole camp now 148 men 8 women 5 children<br/>
79 waggons 96 horses 51 mules 90 <strike>yoke of</strike> oxen 43 cows 3 bulls<br/>
9 calves 16 dogs and 16 chickens.</p>

<p>As we travelled father into the hills they<br/>
grew lofty and we began to come into an Elk bear and mountain sheep<br/>
country. Soon after we arrived at the Springs 15 miles from<br/>
Laramie the first company of [[Missouri|Missouri]] emigrants came up 12 waggons<br/>
of them. We journeyed 10 1/2 miles farther in the afternoon and the Missouri<br/>
company camped a 1/4 of a mile below us.</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday the <time datetime=""",06/06/1847
42658.0,254,,""">6</time>th which we devoted<br/>
to prayer and fasting but the Missouri company of emigrants started on<br/>
in the morning.</p>

<p>The camp met for prayer meeting at 8 o'clock<br/>
and the Spirit of the Lord was with the people and met again for<br/>
preaching at 11 o'clock. We had a shower of rain and the meeting<br/>
closed. Another company of Missouri wagons 20 in number<br/>
passed us. The rain soon cleared off and our company moved<br/>
forward five miles and camped for the night on [[Bitter Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bitter Creek]].</p>

<p>The two Missouri companies which had<br/>
camped near us at night started before us in the morning and while<br/>
moving another company of 13 waggons passed us. We were in a <br/>
fair view of Laramie Peak with its snow covered top. We camped</p>",
42658.0,255,,"<p>for the night on the [[Horseshoe Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Horse Shoe Creek]] in the best feed we had met on our journey. The<br/>
hunters brought in two black tailed deer and one antelope.</p>

<p>Next day we formed a company of men and went forward<br/>
of <strike>comf</strike> our teams and cleared the road of stone. We used pick axes bars spades &amp;c<br/>
and it was a great help to our weak w<strike>g</strike>aggons.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we travelled 8 3/4 miles over the <br/>
most mountan<strike>e</strike>ous road on our way and then descended into the Valley and<br/>
camped for the night on [[La Bonte Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|<u>Labent </u>Creek]] with an abudance of timber water<br/>
and good grass.</p>

<p>Brother [[John Somers Higbee|John Higby]] went forward hunting and saw<br/>
the [[Missouri|Missouri]] companies of emigrants and when they started out they<br/>
had such strife one with another in trying to start first. They did not<br/>
stop to milk their cows and in clearning up their breakfast they strewed their<br/>
meal salt bacon short cake beans and other things upon the ground<br/>
throughout their encampment and when we came up 3 wolves were feeding<br/>
upon the fragments.</p>

<p>In coming over the hills today we found it<br/>
so cold it pierced us like Winter. On reaching the Valley we found<br/>
fires the companies in advance had built and we pilled on the wood<br/>
and soon got warm. An antelope lay before us which the hunters<br/>
had brought in. We carved it up with our knives forked it on<br/>
sticks roasted it and satisfied ourselves finely without the seasoning<br/>
of salt.</p>

<p>We started in the morning at 5 o'clock<br/>
into better feed a mile further on and turned out our teams. The<br/>
brethren did some trading with the hunters who camped near us.</p>

<p>At 7 o'clock 15 of our waggons was formed<br/>
into a company to go forward to make a boat to ferry the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Platte]].<br/>
They went forward and we followed them and the traders started at <br/>
the same time.</p>

<p>Soon another party of traders overtook us<br/>
who were direct from [[Santa Fe, Mexican Cession Territory|Santa Fee]]. They informed us that the Mormon<br/>
Battalion was at [[California|California]] went in Jan and that Capt. [[John Brown, b. 1820|Brown]] was</p>",
42658.0,256,,"<p>in [[Santa Fe, Mexican Cession Territory|Santa Fee]] for money for the detachment and would come on us soon as possible.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the next day Presidents [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] rode with us. Our detached company had not been heard<br/>
of since last night when they camped with the foremost company. We<br/>
camped this night at [[Deer Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Deer Creek]] had good feed and our horses and cattle<br/>
were gaining daily.</p>

<p><u>Ch.</u> <u>28</u></p>

<p>I examined a splendid grinding stone quary<br/>
on the East side of the road as it leaves the hills and strikes the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Platte]] and<br/>
Brother [[Albert Carrington|Carrington]] found a very excellent coal bed on [[Deer Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Deer Creek]]. The<br/>
specimens produced were good.</p>

<p>At the blowing of the horn at night I did<br/>
not feel much like retiring to bed so I walked half a mile<br/>
from the camp on the bank of Deer Creek and found brother<br/>
[[William Clayton|William Clayton]] fishing with a hook. He had caught two<br/>
dozen good fish they resembled the eastern herring. Another brother<br/>
had also caught some. As they were about to leave they left<br/>
their lines for me to fish with.</p>

<p>So I sat down for half an hour musing<br/>
alone as unconcered as though I had been on the banks of<br/>
[[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington River]] in my native place when suddenly I heard<br/>
a rustling in the bushes near me and for the first time the thought<br/>
flushed across me that I was in a country abounding with the<br/>
grizly Bear wolves and Indians and was liable to an attack at<br/>
any moment from either of them away from my company and<br/>
no weapon to defend myself against even a Badger. I thought it<br/>
wisdom to return to camp and picking up my fishing rods I walked<br/>
leasurely home and retired to rest.</p>

<p>Next day we rode our horses during our<br/>
journey several times into the river to find a fording place but<br/>
could not. Our detached company was reported at the ferry<br/>
ten miles or so above us. Our hunters brought in 13 antelopes<br/>
and the M<strike>s</strike>iss<strike>s</strike>ourian Company killed 3 Buffalo.</p>

<p>I started on the following morning</p>",
42658.0,257,,"<p>to go forward in company with brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|A. P. Rockwood]] who was riding President [Brigham Young|Young's]]<br/>
steed when suddenly he sprang upon my horse but instead of striking him he took<br/>
my knee into his jaw and brused me considerably sinking one tooth to the bone<br/>
through three thickness of clothing and one of them buckskin.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and myself then rode on to the<br/>
Ferrying place and found our detachment ferrying over the Missourian company<br/>
who paid the brethren $1.50 cts for each waggon and load and paid in flour<br/>
at $2.50 cts per <u>cwt</u>. while flour through this country was worth at least<br/>
10 dollars per <u>cwt</u>.</p>

<p>It was very difficult to get over the river. They<br/>
carried the goods over in a boat but drew the waggons over the ropes by<br/>
hand but when the current struck them they would frequently roll over<br/>
several times in the water and they came near drowning their horses. One<br/>
of the men would have been lost had not the brethren picked him up<br/>
with the boat. On the road the [[Missouri|Missouri]] company had a <strike>run away</strike> ^stampede^<br/>
of their teams turning over their waggons brusing women and children and<br/>
smashing their things and one ran into the river and would probably have<br/>
drowned and lost all had not a little boy jumped out beside the off<br/>
ox which frightened him and he ""hawed off"" and ran on to a sand bank<br/>
dragging the others with him. The boy was knocked over into the<br/>
water and hurt but the scene ended without any loss of life.</p>

<p>Our blacksmiths had been to work for the<br/>
Missouri company for which they got flour money &amp;c and our<br/>
hunters had been busily engaged. They had killed 5 fat<br/>
buffalo one old she bear and 3 cubs and shot at 2 grizly bear but<br/>
did not get them. Those killed were black bear. Our hunters<br/>
also brought into camp 8 antelope.</p>

<p>Sunday was a very warm day and the camp<br/>
met for prayer meeting at 9 o'clock and at 10 we had a preaching<br/>
meeting. President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] first addressed the meeting and<br/>
was followed by President Young who remarked upon the great<br/>
difference between us as a camp and the Missourian companies<br/>
who were travelling the same road. He said, ""They curse swear</p>",
42658.0,258,,"<p>rip and tare and are trying to swallow up the earth but though they do not<br/>
wish us to have a place on it the Earth will soon open and swallow them<br/>
up and they will go to the land of forgetfulness while the Saints if<br/>
faithful though they suffer some privations here will ultimately inherit<br/>
the earth and increase in power dominion and glory.""</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|He]] spake much to our edification and was followed<br/>
by Elder [[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]] and afterwards the meeting dismissed and the Twelve<br/>
colonels captains &amp;c of the camp met at President Young's waggon and<br/>
consulted upon the measures to be adopted to get across the river. It<br/>
was finally ag<strike>e</strike>reed to go immediately to the mountains with waggons<br/>
and teams and for every two Tens to get polls and lash two or four<br/>
waggons abreast to keep them from turning over and float them<br/>
across the river with boats and ropes. So a company of horsemen<br/>
started for the mountains and teams to draw the poles.</p>

<p>In the evening the flour meal and bacon<br/>
were distributed through the camp equally which had been earned from<br/>
the Missouri company for ferrying them over. It amounted to 5 1/2 lbs<br/>
of flour 2 lbs of meal and a small piece of bacon for each individual<br/>
in the camp. It looked as much of a miracle to me to see our flour<br/>
and meal bags replenished in the midst of the [[Black Hills, Nebraska Territory|Black Hills]] as it did<br/>
to have the children of Israel fed with manna in the Wilderness. But<br/>
the Lord has been truly with us on our journey and wonderfully preserved<br/>
and blessed us.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning the <strike>two</strike> first two<br/>
Tens were called together to make arrangements for crossing. Some of<br/>
our party did not like the mode proprosed to lash the waggons together<br/>
as the current was so strong so we appointed brother [[Thomas Grover|Grover]] as our<br/>
Captain to direct the rafting and concluded to put our poles into a raft<br/>
<strike>and</strike> carry our goods over in a boat and ford our waggons on the raft.</p>

<p>We commenced at 5 o'clock in the morning and <br/>
in four hours we had landed eleven waggon loads of goods upon the<br/>
North Shore with our little leather boat and during the day we got <br/>
over all the waggons belonging to our Tens being eleven waggons in all</p>",
42658.0,259,,"<p>The rest of the encampment being twelve Tens only got<br/>
over the same number of waggons as ourselves. They floated their waggons by<br/>
tying from two to four together but the waggons turned clean over each other<br/>
bottom side up and back again breaking the bows covers and boxes to pieces<br/>
and lo<strike>a</strike>sing ploughs axes and iron left in the boxes.</p>

<p>Most of our company was in the water from<br/>
morning till night and all was very weary when the work was done.</p>

<p>Just <strike>h</strike>as we had drawn Dr. [[Willard Richards|Richards']] two waggons<br/>
to the shore and loaded his goods into them <strike>when</strike> a storm struck us. I sprang<br/>
into my carriage tied all down tight and laid out my whole strength in<br/>
holding my waggon cover on but the rain wind and hail beat so<br/>
heavily that it was a task and my bed and things were nearly drenched<br/>
It only lasted seven minutes but was severe on our waggons and goods<br/>
and our horses ran two or three miles in the storm. I crossed the<br/>
[[Platte River, unorganized U.S. territory|river]] went after them tied them up and returned weary but had some<br/>
pleasant dreams at night.</p>

<p>I felt unwell next day from the exposures <br/>
of yesterday and with the teeth ache with which I had suffered much<br/>
on my pioneer journey. It was very windy to day and our companies<br/>
crossed the river very slowly. Another [[Missouri|Missouri]] company had<br/>
come up with us.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] thought it wisdom to leave<br/>
a number of the brethren here <strike>with</strike> ^until^ our companies deigning to follow us<br/>
come up and for them to keep a Ferry for the emigrants on the road<br/>
not of our people who would pay $1.50 cts per waggon in flour at<br/>
$2.00 cts per <u>cwt</u> and cows at $10.</p>

<p>The brethren made two new rafts on the<br/>
third day of our fording the river and got quite a number of our<br/>
Pioneer waggons over. I was still unwell but in company with<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] I went on to some of the Bluffs to view the country<br/>
and shot one antelope. This was the first antelope I ever killed.</p>

<p>We had some heavy squals of wind and rain<br/>
and in the evening many of us went over the river and tied up our horses</p>",
42658.0,260,,"<p>and when one company was returning in the leather boat it half filled and they<br/>
came near<strike>ly</strike> sinking.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning we swam our<br/>
horses over and one mule was nearly drowned by being tangled in a rope but<br/>
the current carried him ashore.</p>

<p>Twenty men the day before went down the<br/>
river to dig out two large canoes to cover over and make a Ferry boat.<br/>
The emigrants were arriving daily at our Fording place and they reported<br/>
one thousand waggons between there and [[Fort Laramie, Nebraska Territory|Laramie]]. This was the<br/>
5 <strike>6</strike>th day spent in ferrying our Pioneer company across the river but now<br/>
we had succeeded in getting all over and once more formed our waggons<br/>
into a circle. Over brethren crossed some of the Missourians also and<br/>
ran their boat all night in ferrying them.</p>

<p>Next day also we were still ferrying the <br/>
Gentiles and another large company arrived. We gathered our cattle at<br/>
10 o'clock and harnessed but did not start as all were not ready to <br/>
we turned out our teams again</p>

<p>In the afternoon we heald a council and<br/>
resolved to leave 9 men to tend the Ferry to ford emigrant compaies<br/>
and also our own brethren who should come after us. The men were<br/>
chosen and we met with them again in the evening. President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
rebuked one who <strike>he</strike>pettioned to stay but whom he wished to continue on<br/>
with us. He also instructed the brethren who were to tarry to keep<br/>
together and divide their means accumulated equally according to their<br/>
labour for each to esteem his brother as himself in no wise to <br/>
retain that which belonged to the traveller to be careful of the lives<br/>
and property of those they ferried to forget not their prayers and to come<br/>
up after us with the next company of Saints.</p>

<p>The brethren to remain at the Ferry were<br/>
[[Thomas Grover|Thomas Grover]], captain; [[John Somers Higbee|John S. Higby]] [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] [[William Empy|William Empy]]<br/>
[[Edmund Ellsworth|Edmund Elsworth]] [[Benjamin F. Stewart|Benjamin F. Stewart]] [[Francis Martin Pomeroy|Francis Pomeroy]] [[James Davenport|James<br/>
Davenport]] and [[Appleton Harmon|Appleton Harmon]]</p>

<p>After 7 days tarry we continued our</p>",
42658.0,261,,"<p>journey travelled during the day 21 1/2 miles and had the most wretched camping ground<br/>
at night we had found on the way. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] thought it might be properly called<br/>
hell-gate.  The country abounded with alkaline and the water was disgustingly<br/>
naucious. Our horses and cattle being thirst<strike>l</strike>y drank some and left it and some<br/>
of the cattle got badly mired in the marshes. Our hunters brought in one<br/>
buffalo 1 deer and 3 antelope.</p>

<p>Early on the Sunday morning we hitched up without<br/>
feed or water and left our encampment of death poison-waters and alkaline<br/>
marshes and drove 3 miles to a good campground and sweet water. This was<br/>
on the [[Willow Springs, unorganized U.S. Territory|Willow Spring]] branch about 3  miles from the head.</p>

<p>We bated 2 hours and took breakfast and<br/>
President Young wished me to go on about 15 miles and look up a camp<br/>
ground for the night. So I went forward and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] with<br/>
me to the head of the Willow Spring. Here he stoped with a doctor<br/>
of a Missourian company who had been attending a sick family to<br/>
wait for our waggons to come up and I rode on alone</p>

<p>After travelling alone several miles brother [[John Brown, b. 1820|John <br/>
Brown]] came up with me and we rode on together over a sandy barren sage<br/>
country to a creek of good water about 10 miles west of the Willow Springs<br/>
We arrived here at half past 1 o'clock, and turned out our horses to bait.</p>

<p>Here we tarried till four o'clock watching for<br/>
our waggons to come in sight but we could see no waggons. At length<br/>
two horsemen were seen approaching and we waved a small flag for<br/>
them to come to us supposing they were of our company but they turned<br/>
out to be two hunters of the Missouri companies carrying in buffalo<br/>
meat to their camp. In the distance they thought we were Indians<br/>
and made off.</p>

<p>I mounted my horse and put after them and<br/>
soon overtook them and made inquiries concerning our company. They<br/>
said they had not seen it but had seen about a dozen waggons<br/>
coming by themselves.</p>

<p>I then concluded that our camp had stoped<br/>
at the Willow Springs and so Captain Smith <strike>one of the hunters and</strike> who was the leader</p>",
42658.0,262,,"<p>of the [[Missouri|Missouri]] ^Co^ invited us to go on and camp with them for the night as they did not<br/>
expect to go more than a few miles further than the [[Willow Springs, unorganized U.S. Territory|Creek]] we were now<br/>
on. We could see five miles on the road back and no waggons<br/>
were in sight and as it was now five o'clock I concluded our company<br/>
would not come on and if they did they would go no farther than<br/>
the Creek.</p>

<p>We accepted Captain Smith's proposal and<br/>
went on with him to spend the night with his camp but instead of<br/>
journying only a mile or so he continued on mile after mile finding<br/>
neither feed nor water excepting salt and alkaline grounds until we struck<br/>
the [[Sweetwater River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Sweet Water]] <strike>river</strike> at [[Independence Rock, Nebraska Territory|Independence Rock]] so noted already in Fremont's<br/>
Journal and by other travellers. This was 12 miles from the Creek<br/>
before spoken of.</p>

<p>The Sweet Waters were sweet indeed both<br/>
to man and beast after travelling th<strike>o</strike>rough so much alkiline country<br/>
and there was good feed around.</p>

<p>After a good supper of bacon buffalo corn<br/>
bread coffee milk &amp;c I laid down in a tent with the Missourians but<br/>
did not rest well. I found there was a great difference between<br/>
these Missouri emigrant companies and our own where there was<br/>
no such thing as cursing swearing quarrelling contending with<br/>
other companies &amp;c allowed or practised.</p>

<p>But to return to our Pioneer company. At<br/>
a late hour they came up to the Creek which we had left 12 miles<br/>
back and grass being poor continued on 4 miles West of the creek<br/>
and camped for the night. Not finding me at the creek nor hearing<br/>
from me at all they felt somewhat alarmed lest I was lost or had got<br/>
into trouble with the Indians. They blew the bugle and watched<br/>
for me till midnight and finally fired the cannon while I was<br/>
camped 10 miles from them not thinking that I was giving them<br/>
any trouble. I travelled this day a distance of thirty miles<br/>
and our Pioneer company 20 miles.</p>",

<p>I arose early this morning took breakfast and in company with<br/>
Brother [[John Brown, b. 1820|Brown]] rode clear round Independance Rock. We examined the many<br/>
names and lists of names of the trappers traders travellers and emigrants nearby<br/>
all in black red and yellow paint on this rock. Some had washed out and<br/>
defaced. The greatest number was put on within a few years but we<br/>
found some of thirty years standing. Nearly all the companies who<br/>
pass put their names on. <strike>this rock</strike></p>

<p>After going around and examining it we<br/>
staked our horses and mounted it. I went forward and gained the<br/>
highest point of the south and of the Rock which contains the names. I<br/>
then went to the North end which is the highest point of Independance<br/>
Rock. Here is an opening or cavern that would contain 30 or 40 persons<br/>
and a rock standing upon the highest peak of about 3 tons weight</p>

<p>Upon this rock at the highest point we climbed<br/>
and offered up our prayers according to the order of the Priesthood praying<br/>
earnestly for the blessing of God to rest on President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and his<br/>
brethren the Twelve and all the Pioneer camp, the whole camp and<br/>
House of Israel in the wilderness our wives children and relatives, the <br/>
Mormon Battelion and the Churches abroad. While offering up our<br/>
prayers the Spirit of the Lord descended upon us.</p>

<p><u>I was the First Latter-day Saint on Independance Rock</u></p>

<p>We had a view of our camp from the Rock and<br/>
expected they would noon there so we mounted our horses and<br/>
concluded to examine the country around. We rode five<br/>
miles to the North East went on to the top of a high bluff and</p>",
42658.0,264,,"<p>saw our camp in motion. We than rode to the foot of the mountain<br/>
and traced the way to the</p>

<p>[[Devil|Devil's Gate]]</p>

<p>through which the [[Sweetwater River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Sweet Water]] runs. Here we spent but a few<br/>
moments and then hurried back to [[Independence Rock, unorganized U.S. Territory|Indipendence Rock]]. As our camp<br/>
had come up before we could get to them and camped half a mile East<br/>
of <strike>the Rock</strike> it.</p>

<p>I met President [[Brigham Young|Young]] going up to Independence<br/>
Rock and <strike>I</strike> related to him my travels since I left the company. He<br/>
asked me to go back with him so I turned out my horse having rode<br/>
him twenty miles during the forenoon and returned with President Young<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and others. We spent half<br/>
an hour on the Rock and then returned to our camp mounted our horses<br/>
and rode to the Devil's Gate, five miles from Indipendence<br/>
Rock</p>

<p>We rode as far as we could into the Gate<br/>
hitched our horses and walked into about the centre of the cavern</p>

<p>The Devils Gate is 400 feet high, perpendicular<br/>
rocks, 120 feet wide and 50 rods long and the water rushes through<br/>
it with a roar. The rocks are course grey granite with a vein of<br/>
black trap rock running through. We spent about half an hour here<br/>
and then had to back our horses out and rode around it on the<br/>
South Side. Some of the footmen walked over the top of it. We<br/>
camped for the night about one mile west of the Devil's Gate on the<br/>
bank of the Sweet Water.</p>

<p>A Guide Board was put up at Devils Gate<br/>
stating that it was 175 1/4 miles from [[Fort Laramie, Nebraska Territory|Fort Laramie]] and 50 1/4 from<br/>
our Ferry of the [[Platte River, Nebraska Territory|Platte River]].</p>

<p>Two more Missourian companies overtook<br/>
us at noon on our next day's travel and they informed us that a<br/>
man was drowned at the Ferry after we left in trying to swim his</p>",
42658.0,265,1847-06-26,"<p>horses and they had not found his body.</p>

<p>The camp started on again after our company had nooned<br/>
but brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Jesse Carter Little|Little]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] and myself went back to meet [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]]<br/>
who had broken an a<strike>b</strike>xletree of his waggon and we were behind all the<br/>
afternoon.</p>

<p>After a journey of 20 3/4 miles the Pioneers camped<br/>
at night at the foot of a mound about 200 feet high on the bank of [[Sweetwater River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Sweet Water]]<br/>
Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself went to the top of it and looked down upon the camp<br/>
and it appeared to us delightful. We offered up our prayers and the S<strike>r</strike>pi<strike>t</strike>rit<br/>
of the Lord rested up us and then we decended to the camp. The moon<br/>
was shining beautifully. On the 24th the best horse in camp President Young's was shot by accident.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 26 after a travel of 18 3/4 miles we camped<br/>
opposite the table rock and near the summit of the South Pass. I<br/>
was quite astonished at the road and country to day considering we<br/>
were crossing the South Pass of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]] it was the best<br/>
road we had travelled over for many days and had it not been for<br/>
the <strike>wide river</strike> ^[[Wind River Range, unorganized U.S. Territory|Wind River]]^ range of mountains in full view of our right covered with<br/>
eternal snow and some snow banks 10 feet deep by the side of the<br/>
road as we passed along with the table rock on the left I should almost<br/>
have thought myself travelling over the beautiful prairies of [[Illinois|Illinois]] and<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] excepting that the country was covered with more sage than<br/>
prairie grass. The road for many miles and also the plain<br/>
of beautiful grass lying North of the table rock were strewn with<br/>
very handsome cornelian stones. I saw more in one hour this evening<br/>
than ever before during my whole ^life <strike>travels</strike>^ either in the rude state or polished<br/>
<strike>and set in breast pins &amp;c</strike> in all the jewellers shops I ever saw in my<br/>
travels</p>

<p>Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]], [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]], [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]] &amp; [[John Brown, b. 1820|Brown]]<br/>
had gone to take observations on the dividing ridge and they</p>",
42658.0,266,1847-06-27,"<p>continued on to the [[Green River, Sweetwater County, Wyoming Territory|Green River]] 7 miles from us which runs into the Pacific<br/>
while we were on the [[Sweetwater River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Sweet Waters]] that run into the Altantic. They<br/>
supposed that we should come on to them and as they did not return<br/>
several of us mounted our horses to go in search of them but we soon<br/>
met brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] returning and he informed us that the rest of<br/>
brethren would camp on the Green River with some men from [[Oregon|Oregon]] on their way to the States</p>

<p><time datetime=""",06/27/1847

the martyrdom of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]]</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning but we harnessed<br/>
up our teams and drove to where brothers [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] had camped<br/>
with Major Harris who had been travelling through [[Oregon|Oregon]] and [[California|California]]<br/>
for 25 years and had much acquaintance with the Country. He brought<br/>
a file of Oregon papers and one published by [[Samuel S. Brannan|S. Brannon]] of<br/>
California. We had much conversation with him and<br/>
he spoke unfavourably of the [[Salt Lake Valley, Utah|Salt Lake Country]] for a settlement.<br/>
but spoke of other places not far off that were good</p>

<p>Meeting with Mr. [[Mr. Bridger|Bridger]]</p>

<p>We parted with Major Harris next day after doing some<br/>
trading with him and in our afternoon's travel met Mr Bridger of<br/>
the fort on the way with two men going to [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Laramie]]. He<br/>
was expecting us and wished to have an interview with President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
and the Twelve and we also wished to have an interview with him <br/>
so we immediately returned to the Creek upon which we had<br/>
nooned and camped for the night and Mr. Bridger and his men<br/>
camped with us.</p>

<p>We met in council with Mr Bridger and<br/>
spent some hours in conversation and found him to have been a great<br/>
traveller and <strike>had</strike> ^professed^ an extensive knowledge of nearly all Oregon and<br/>
California—the mountains lakes rivers springs valleys mines ore &amp;c<br/>
He spoke more highly of the [[Utah Territory|Great Basin]] for a settlement than</p>",
42658.0,267,,"<p>Major Harris had done said that it was his paradise and that if this people<br/>
settled in it he wanted to settle with them. He said that there was but one thing<br/>
that could operate against its becoming a great grain country and that would<br/>
be frost for he did not know but the frost might affect the corn. He conversed<br/>
with us about a great variety of subjects connected with the country said he was<br/>
ashamed of the maps of [[John Charles Fremont|Fremont]] and that he knew nothing about the country only<br/>
the plain travelled road and that he could correct all the maps published<br/>
of the Western world.</p>

<p>We parted next day from Mr. [[Mr. Bridger|Bridger]] who <br/>
remarked that it would not be prudent to bring a great population<br/>
to the [[Utah Territory|Bason]] until we ascertained whether grain would grow or<br/>
not. [[Orrin Porter Rockwell|O. P. Rockwell]] and myself went forward to pick out<br/>
a camp ground. It was fifteen miles from where we nooned before<br/>
we could get grass and this made the longest day's journey we had<br/>
travelled on the whole route making 23 3/4 miles.</p>

<p>We travelled 8 miles on the last day of June<br/>
and camped on the bank of the [[Green River, Sweetwater County, Wyoming Territory|Green River]] at the Ferry and the afternoon<br/>
was spent in building a raft as the river was high and could only be crossed<br/>
upon rafts or boats.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the arrival of Elder [[Samuel S. Brannan|Samuel S. Brannan]] from the [[Bay of San Francisco, Mexican Cession Territory|bay of San Francisco]] was anounced in camp<br/>
and we were glad to meet with him to hear from the Saints who went<br/>
with him. He gave us an account of their landing their travels<br/>
and present settlement which was two hundred miles up the river from<br/>
the bay and they were putting in wheat and building up their place.</p>

<p>During the <strike>two</strike> three following days we were<br/>
fording Green River. On the afternoon of the second the Twelve<br/>
held a council and four men were appointed to return and meet the<br/>
Camp of Israel and pi<strike>o</strike>l<strike>i</strike>ot them up. We each wrote our voices concerning<br/>
the counsel to be given to the camp. I wrote a letter next day<br/>
to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] and [[John Benbow|John Benbow]] to be taken back by the<br/>

<u>The Return of the First Detachment of the Mormon Battalion</u></p>

<p>The Fourth of July came on Sunday. I accompanied Presidents<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards|Richards]] <strike>wit</strike>and others with the pilots to the Ferry to<br/>
put them across and when we arrived at the river we saw 13 horseman<br/>
on the opposite bankwith their baggage on one of our rafts. But to our<br/>
great joy who should they be but our brethren of the Mormon Battalion<br/>
belonging to Captain [[John Brown, b. 1820|Brown's]] detachment who had been at [[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Pueblo]]<br/>
during the Winter. [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] whom we had sent<br/>
unto them had reached them with information of our movements and<br/>
the whole detachment of 140 of the brethren were within seven days drive of us.</p>

<p>When we met these brethren it was truly<br/>
a hearty greeting and shaking of hands. We crossed them all over<br/>
the river excepting one who returned with our pilots to meet<br/>
the following companies of the Saints. This small detachment<br/>
of the Battalion had about a dozen of their horses stolen by some<br/>
horse thieves but they overtook them and got them all back but<br/>
two which had gone on to [[Fort Bridger, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bridger]].</p>

<p>We left [[Green River, Sweetwater County, Wyoming Territory|Green River]] (the head waters of <br/>

Fork]] There was neither feed nor water between this place and Green River but simileer to the last 200 miles a sandy desert<br/>
covered with sagebrush.</p>

<p>Next evening we camped on the west<br/>
side of [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] which we crossed on the following day and<br/>
drove to Fort Bridger. In the region of the fort before we got<br/>
on to our camping ground we crossed more than a dozzen trout<br/>

buttons and the whole region of country up and down these.</p>",

<p>The brethren caught several brook trout which was<br/>
the first I had seen since I left [[England|England]] and as we were to spend the next day at<br/>
the [[Fort Bridger, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort]] I calculated upon a day of fishing. So as soon as I had my breakfast<br/>
next morning I rigged up my trout rod that I had brought with me from [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]<br/>
fixed my reel line and artificial fly and went to one of the brooks close by<br/>
to try my luck.</p>

<p>The men at the Fort said that there were but<br/>
very few trout in the streams and a good many of the brethren were already<br/>
at the creeks with their rods trying their skill baiting with fresh meat<br/>
and grasshoppers but no one was catching any.</p>

<p>I went and threw my fly into the water and<br/>
it being the first time that I ever tried the artificial fly in America<br/>
or ever saw it tried I watched it as it floated upon the water<br/>
with as much interest as [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] did his kite string so was I highly<br/>
gratified when I saw the nimble trout dart at my fly hook himself<br/>
and run away with the line but I soon worried him out and<br/>
drew him to shore.</p>

<p>I fished two or three hours during the<br/>
morning and evening and caught twelve in all. One half of them<br/>
would weigh 3/4 lbs each while all the rest of the camp did not<br/>
catch 3 lbs in all which was proof positive that the artificial fly is<br/>
far the best to fish with.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went to Bridger's<br/>
house and traded off my flint lock riffle for four buffalo <strike>e</strike>calves<br/>
which were large nice and well dressed. At this fort I found<br/>
things generally at least one thir[ink blot] higher than I had ever met at<br/>
any <strike>any</strike>other trading post I ever saw in Amer<strike>d</strike>ica.</p>

<p>I arose in the morning quite unwell<br/>
and felt threatened with the <strike>camp</strike> Mountain fever yet I mounted my<br/>
horse and rode till ten o'clock but before I started I was called.</p>",
42658.0,270,1847-07-10,"<p>upon to administer to Bro [[William Carter|Carter]] who was taken with the fever. There were<br/>
new cases of the Mountain fever every day in camp. At ten<br/>
o'clock I had to give up and take to my bed in the waggon with distressing<br/>
pain in my head back joint bones marrow and all through my system<br/>
attended with cold chills and hot flashes through the body and we travelled<br/>
over 13 miles of as bad road as any we had on our journey which made<br/>
it exceedingly painful to the sick. the day seemed very long to me.<br/>
When we stoped at night I took composition cayeene and a dose<br/>
of vegitable pills had a better night than I expecetd and though<br/>
I was fe<strike>b</strike>eble in the morning I felt my fever was broken<br/>
up and I recovering.</p>

<p><strike>After this</strike> We camped for the night on<br/>
the <time datetime=""",07/10/1847
42658.0,270,,""">10</time>th 1 1/2 miles from [[Bear River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bear River]] by the best stream of water<br/>
we had found on the route and a small stream near by <strike>and</strike><br/>
We had travelled this day up and down steep hills and passed through<br/>
a valley six miles long grass knee deep strong mineral springs<br/>
copper lead coal and lime.</p>

<p>Camp fires were discovered about 3<br/>
miles from our camping ground and [[George Albert Smith|Georg A Smith]] and<br/>
others went over to them and found it to be a Mr. [[Miles Goodyear|Miles<br/>
Goo<strike>y</strike>dyier]]. He had settled at [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Salt Lake]] and had a garden and<br/>
vegitation he said doing well. Several Missourians were with<br/>
with him going to the States.</p>

<p>The subject was brought up concerning<br/>
the emigrant company who perished in the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] last Winter.<br/>
They were mostly from [[Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Indipendence]] and [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]] counties Missouri<br/>
and were a mob company that threatened to drive out the<br/>
Mormons who were in [[California|California]] and started with that spirit<br/>
in their hearts. But it seemed as though they were<br/>
ripe for judgement. The snows fell upon them 18 feet<br/>
deep on a level and they died and eat up each other. About<br/>
40 persons perished and were mostly eaten up by those who<br/>
survived them. Mrs [[Levinah W. Jackson Murphy|L. Murphy]] of [[Tennessee|Tenn]]. whom I</p>",
42658.0,271,,"<p>baptized while on a mission in that country but since apostatized and joined<br/>
the mob was in that company and died or was killed and eaten up and [[Levinah W. Jackson Murphy|her]]<br/>
bones sawed to pieces for her <strike>bones</strike> brains and marrow and left strewed upon the<br/>
ground.</p>

<p>We spent the Sunday in camp but some of the<br/>
brethren rode out to seek out the road and found a tar spring about 15<br/>
miles South of our camp.</p>

<p>Early on the Monday morning I rode to [[Bear River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bear<br/>
River]] and for the first time I saw the long looked for</p>

<p>[[Bear River Valley, United States|Bear River Valley]]</p>

<p>The spot where we struck it was not very interesting. There was<br/>
considerable grass in the valley and some timber and thick brushes<br/>
on the bank of the river. My object in riding to the river before<br/>
the camp was to try my luck in fishing for trout. After<br/>
fishing for several hours I started after the camp having<br/>
caught 8 trout in all.</p>

<p>The camp had travelled 9 miles and <br/>
nooned in a valley. I found President [[Brigham Young|Young]] very sick with<br/>
the fever. The company had started on but President Young<br/>
being so sick concluded not to move from where he was. Brothers<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] and others staid with him with<br/>
their waggons</p>

<p>We drove without any road over hills<br/>
and dales having to make our road as we went along. We camped<br/>
at night <strike>l in Mathews Valley</strike> by the side of Reddings Cave. The valleys<br/>
were beginning to grow more fertile and the air more pacific.</p>

<p>I arose quite unwell in the morning. Several brethren<br/>
went to meet President Young, and the camp laid still waiting for him to<br/>
come up. Brother Kimball came at noon and a council of the whole<br/>
was called and it was resolved that [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] take a company of ^about^ 20<br/>
waggons and 40 men and go on to the Kanyon and make a road as</p>",
42658.0,272,,"<p>they went <strike>along</strike> <strike>and if they could not go through Kanyon to find Smith's cutoff<br/>
and make a road over the mountain</strike> so that we need not be hindered when we<br/>
came along. There were 23 waggons in all that started at 1'oclock.</p>

<p>We had found but little game for many days<br/>
until yesterday when the Hunters brought in 12 antelope and 10 to day.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] was better to day but designed not<br/>
to move until to morrow. In the afternoon I <strike>walked</strike>rode out with Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
in search of springs of water.</p>

<p>Next <strike>In the</strike> morning I rode back 7 miles to visit<br/>
President Young and found him much better in health and quite cheerful<br/>
The evening before Dr Richards myself and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] went before<br/>
the Lord to pray for brother Young and we had a testimony that he<br/>
would recover<strike>ed</strike> from that hour. I found brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] the sickest<br/>
man that had been in our company. I tarried until near night assisting<br/>
the <strike>camp</strike> ^sick^ and then returned back to our encampment.</p>

<p>I started early in the morrow with my<br/>
carriage and horses to go back for President Young and brother Rockwood<br/>
I was two hours driving 7 miles to their camp. I found them much<br/>
better and they thought they could ride as my carriage was the easiest<br/>
vehicle in our company. I made up a bed and took them both into<br/>
my carriage and the rest of the waggons started and drove to the main<br/>
body and the sick seemed refreshed with their ride. After a short halt<br/>
the whole company drove 4 1/2 miles and camped for the night</p>

<p>Next day I again took Brothers Young<br/>
and Rockwood in my carriage and drove them during the day. We<br/>
had bad road for the sick and brother Brigham was wearied out and <br/>
worse at night. I went to [[Weber River, Utah Territory|Weber's Fork]] 1 mile from our encampment<br/>
at night and caught a trout for him.</p>

<p>He was still sick in the morning and after<br/>
we had driven three miles on to Weber's Fork we camped the remainder<br/>
of the day in consequence of President Young being worse. The Twelve<br/>
and others went out and prayed for him and the sick according to<br/>
the order of the Priesthood.</p>",

<p><strike>and</strike> In company with [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]]<br/>
and [[Howard Egan|Howard Egan]] I rode over the mountain called [[Donner-Reed Pass, Utah Territory|Pratt's Pass]] with the company<br/>
that went on an then returned to President Young.</p>

<p>Next morning we started early and stoped for breakfast<br/>
after a five miles drive. I carried brother Brigham in my carriage. The<br/>
fever was still on him but he stood the ride well.</p>

<p>After breakfast we travelled 10 miles over the worse<br/>
road of the whole journey. Our camping ground this night was on a trout<br/>
creek. Here we found 3 waggons had tarried in consequence of the<br/>
sick. Brothers [[Henry Garlick Sherwood|Sherwood]] [[Luke Johnson|Johnson]] and [[Albert Dewey|Dewey]] were so sick they<br/>
could not journey and we camped with them and baptized them for<br/>
their sickness and I confirmed them. This morning brother [[Orson Pratt|Pratt's]] company<br/>
were only 8 miles farther on than <strike>where</strike> where we camped at night.</p>

<p>We remained in camp next day in consequence<br/>
of sickness. <strike>The stream we were on was</strike> <strike>Ogdon's Fork</strike> ^We were on East Kanyon Creek^ and the route we<br/>
were taking was Reed's Pass which we named Pratt's Pass in consequence of<br/>
his going on to make the road.</p>

<p>Next day 8 miles were made of our journey and<br/>
East Ka<strike>ynon</strike>^nyon^ Creek the camping place. It was 8 miles of the worst of<br/>
roads and Brother [[James Case|Case]] smas<strike>s</strike>hed one of his hind wheels to pieces and we<br/>
had to wait 2 hours to bring his waggon up. The sick stood the journey<br/>
better than we expected during the day considering the bad road.</p>

travelled to the West five miles up hill which brought us to the summit<br/>
and then descended the mountain 6 miles through a thick timbered grove<br/>
The timber had been cut out of the road yet it was full of stumps and<br/>
it kept each teamster very busy to do<strike>g</strike>dge the stumps and not break<br/>
his waggon. One man turned over his ox waggon and smashed<br/>
the tops all to pieces. There were two children in the waggon but<br/>
they were not hurt.</p>",
42658.0,274,1847-07-24,"<p>We nooned at a beautiful spring in a small birch grove<br/>
There was more timber during this half days travel than we had seen in a month and<br/>
the valleys both ascending and descending were extremely fertile and covered with vegitation<br/>
to the tops of the hills</p>

<p>At the spring where we nooned we were met by<br/>
brothers [[John Pack|Pack]] and [[William Matthews|Mathews]] from the forward camps. They brought a<br/>
letter to us &amp; informed us that it was only 10 miles to the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley of the<br/>
Great Salt Lake]] or Great Basin and 14 to their camp. They <br/>
had explored the country as far as possible and made choice of a spot to<br/>
put in crops.</p>

<p>After nooning we travelled up another very<br/>
tedious hill and down into a valley and camped for the night.</p>

<p>This was an important day in the history of my life and in<br/>
the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

<p>After travelling from our encampment 6<br/>
miles through the deep ravine valley ending with the Ka<strike>yy</strike>nyon we <br/>
came in full view of the Valley of the Great Salt Lake or the Great<br/>
Bas<strike>i</strike>on—the Land of Promise held in reserve by the hand of God for<br/>
a resting place for the Saints.</p>

<p>We gazed with wonder and admiration<br/>
upon the vast fertile Valley spread out before us for about 25 miles<br/>
and 16 in wedth clothed with a heavy garment of vegitation and in the<br/>
midst of which glistened the waters of the Great Salt Lake with<br/>
mountains all around lowering to the skys and streams riv<strike>ll</strike>ulets<br/>
and creeks of pure water running through the beautiful valley.</p>",

and rocky ka<strike>yn</strike>^ny^ions to gaze upon a [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|valley]] of such vast extent surrounded with<br/>
a perfect chain of everlasting mountains covered with eternal snow with their<br/>
innumerable peaks like pyramids towering towards heaven presented at one<br/>
view to us the grandest scenery and prospect that we could have obtained on<br/>
earth. Thoughts of pleasant meditations ran in rapid succession<br/>
through our minds at the anticipation that not many years hence the<br/>
House of God would be established in the mountains and exalted above<br/>
the hills while the valleys would be converted into orchards vineyards<br/>
and fields &amp; planted with cities and the standard of Zion be unfurled for<br/>
the nations to gather.</p>

<p>Ch. 29</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] expressed his full satisfaction<br/>
in the appearence of the Valley as a resting place for the Saints and was<br/>
amply repaid for his journey ^and while tarying upon his bed in my carriage gazing upon the scene before him many things of the future concerning the valley was shown to him in vision.^</p>

<p>After gazing awhile upon the scenery before<br/>
us we travelled across the table land 4 miles into the Valley to the<br/>
encampment of our brethren who had arrived two days before us. They<br/>
had pitched upon the bank of two small streams of pure water and had<br/>
commenced plowing and broken about 5 acres of ground. They had also<br/>
began planting potatoes; and as soon as we were formed into the <br/>
encampment before I took my dinner having 1/2 bushel of potatoes<br/>
I went to the plowed field and planted them hoping with the blessing<br/>
of God to save at least the seed for another year. The brethren<br/>
had damed up one of the Creeks and dug a trench and by night nearly<br/>
the whole ground which was found very dry was irrigated.</p>

<p>Towards evening brothers [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[George Albert Smith|Smith]]<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] and myself rode several miles up the creek into the mountains<br/>
to look for timber see the country &amp;c.</p>

<p>There was a thunder shower and it rained nearly over the whole valley. It also rained some in the fore<br/>
part of the night. We felt thankful for this as it was</p>",

<p><u>The First Sunday In The Valley</u><br/>
<u><time datetime=""",07/25/1847
42658.0,276,,""">July 25</time>th</u></p>

<p>This was the first Sunday the Church of Jesus Christ of<br/>
Latter-day Saints spent in the Great Salt Lake Valley. We<br/>
shaved and cleaned up and met in the circle of the encampment<br/>
Meeting was opened by the Bishops and</p>

<p><u>[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] Preached the First Sermon</u></p>

<p>It was an interesting discourse. [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]]<br/>
followed.</p>

<p>After an intermission of two hours the Church <br/>
met again at 2 o'clock and the Bishops broke bread to the<br/>
congregation. I then addressed the brethren and was followed by <br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]. Several other brethren also expressed<br/>
their feelings and all expressed the universal satisfaction with the Valley<br/>
and were joyfully disappointed at the whole prospect.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting President [[Brigham Young|Young]] <br/>
though feeble addressed the congregation for a few moments. He<br/>
informed the brethren that they must not work on Sunday; that<br/>
they would loose five times as much as they would gain by it.<br/>
None were to hunt or fish on that day and there should not any man<br/>
dwell among us who would not observe these rules. They might go<br/>
and dwell where they pleased but should not dwell with us. He<br/>
said that no man should buy any land who came here that he had<br/>
none to sell neither should he buy any but every man should<br/>
have his land measured out to him for city and farming purposes<br/>
He might till it as he pleased but he must be industrious and<br/>
take care of it.</p>",
42658.0,277,,"<p>On the Monday the camp in general was busily engaged<br/>
in ploughing and planting corn and other seeds. Ten men were chosen for an</p>

<p><u>Exploring Expedition through the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]]</u></p>

<p>I took President [[Brigham Young|Young]] into my carriage and travelled two miles towards the<br/>
mountain and made choice of a spot of ground for our garden with a small<br/>
rivlet running through it which I named garden Creek.</p>

<p>We then returned to camp and went North about<br/>
five miles and we all went to the top of a high peak on the edge of<br/>
the mountain which we considered a good place to raise an ensign. To<br/>
we named it <u>[[Ensign Peak, Utah Territory|Ensign Peak]]</u></p>

<p>I was the first person who ascended this hill<br/>
which we had thus named. Brother Young was very weary in climbing<br/>
being feeble from his recent fever.</p>

<p>We descended to the Valley and started North to<br/>
visit the hot sulpher springs but we returned two miles to get a drink<br/>
of cold water and then went back 4 miles to the Springs, and then<br/>
returned to the camp quite weary. Brothers [[Joseph Matthews|Mathews]] and [[John Brown|Brown]]<br/>
had crossed the Valley in the narrowest place opposite the camp to<br/>
the West mountain and found it ^about^ 15 miles</p>

<p>Next morning brother [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] came<br/>
into camp and informed us that [[John Brown|Brown's]] detatchment of the Mormon<br/>
Battalion would be with us in about two days.</p>

<p>We again started on our exploring expedition<br/>
Brother Lyman and all of the members of the Quorum of the Twelve<br/>
in camp being 8 in number were of the company. Six others of the<br/>
brethren were with us among whom was [[Samuel S. Brannan|Brannon]] from [[San Francisco Bay, California|San Francisco]].</p>

<p><u>Visit to the [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Salt Lake]]</u></p>

<p>We started for the purpose of visiting the Salt Lake and mountain<br/>
on the west of the Valley. We travelled two miles west from</p>",
42658.0,278,,"<p>[[Temple Square, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple Block]] and came to the [[Jordan River, Utah Territory|Utah outlet]] of the [[Utah Lake, Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah Lake]] thence 14 miles<br/>
to the West Mountain and found that the land was not near so fertile on the<br/>
west side of the Valley as on the East and but little fresh water as far<br/>
as we went while the East side of the Valley was <strike>as</strike> well watered. <strike>as any<br/>
land I ever saw.</strike></p>

<p>We took our dinner at the fresh water pool<br/>
and then rode 6 miles to a large rock on the shore of the [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Salt Lake]] where<br/>
we made a halt and we all went into the Salt water. It was quite <br/>
warm and inpregnated with as much salt as could possibly be dissolved<br/>
in water. No person could sink in it but would float and roll<br/>
on the top like a dry log. While standing to our waist in water<br/>
we could not get our knees to the bottom but would rise to the top like<br/>
cork. The whole body of the water would make at least 3 pints<br/>
of the best white salt to one gallon of water. There was a lot of<br/>
beautiful white salt on the shore. We concluded that the Salt<br/>
Lake was one of the wonders of the world. After spending<br/>
an hour here we rode south on the Lake shore about 4 miles<br/>
and then returned 10 miles to our place of nooning. The whole<br/>
distance of the day was 40 miles.</p>

<p>We arose refreshed by sleep in the open<br/>
and having lost my carriage whip the night before I started<br/>
in the morning on horseback to go after it.</p>

<p>As I got near the place where it was droped<br/>
two objects appeared before me about half mile distant whom I took<br/>
at first for bears but after approaching a little nearer I discovered <br/>
about 20 Indians and as I was unharmed I did not consider it<br/>
prudent to go among them so I wheeled about my horse and started<br/>
on my return at a slow trot.</p>

<p>As soon as I started back they called<br/>
to me and one mounted his horse and came after me with all speed<br/>
When he got within 20 rods of me I stoped and met him and the <br/>
rest followed on. I found them to be Utes and that they<br/>
wanted to trade. I informed him by signs that our camp</p>",
42658.0,279,1847-07-18,"<p>was near so he went on with me to camp. From what we had yet seen of the Utahs<br/>
they appeared friendly though they had a bad name from the Mountaineers.<br/>
The Indian wanted to smoke the pipe of peace with us but we soon started on<br/>
and he waited for his company to come up.</p>

<p>We travelled about 10 miles South under the<br/>
mountain on the West side of the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]]. The land beautiful but<br/>
we could not find any water and not as good soil as on the East. Thence<br/>
we turned our course towards the Pioneer encampment which we reached<br/>
weary after a journey through the day of 30 miles. We saw on the West<br/>
side of the Valley about a hundred goats sheep antelope &amp;c playing<br/>
about the hills and Valley.</p>

<p>After our return to the camp President [[Brigham Young|Young]] called <br/>
a council of the Quorum of the Twelve. There were present<br/>
Brigham Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]<br/>
Wilford Woodruf [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] and [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T.<br/>
Benson]]</p>

<p>We walked from the North camp to about<br/>
the centre between the two creeks when President Young waved<br/>
his hands and said here is the 40 acres for the Temple and the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]]<br/>
can be laid out perfectly square North and South East and West. We<br/>
had conversed upon the subject of the location for the Temple previous to this.</p>

<p>It was then moved and carried that the Temple<br/>
Lot contain 40 acres on the ground where we stood. It was also moved<br/>
and carried that the city be laid out into lots of 10 rods by 20 each exclusive<br/>
of the streets and into blocks of 8 lots each being 10 acres in each block and<br/>
one and a quarter in each lot.</p>

<p>It was further moved and carried that each street<br/>
be laid out 8 rods wide and that there be a side walk on each side 20 feet<br/>
wide and that each house be built in the centre of the lot 20 feet from the<br/>
front line that there night be a uniformity throughout the city.</p>",
42658.0,280,,"<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] remarked that he wished but one house<br/>
be built upon a lot and they being in the centre if they took fire they <strike>would</strike> not<br/>
burn up their neighbours and if any man wanted a market to have it upon<br/>
his own lot and not to lay out public grounds for a market place. Let every man<br/>
cultivate his own lot and set out every kind of fruit trees and shade trees and beautify<br/>
the city.</p>

<p>It was moved and carried that there be four<br/>
Public Squares of 10 acres each to be laid out in various parts of the City for<br/>
Public Grounds. This was in Lot 40° 45 44.</p>

<p>At 8 o'clock the whole camp came together on the<br/>
same ground and passed all of the above votes unanimously as they are recorded and<br/>
when the business part of the meeting was closed President Young arosed and <br/>
addressed the assembly upon a varity of subjects.</p>

<p>In his remarks President Young remarked that he <br/>
was determined to have all things in order and righteousness should be practised<br/>
in the land. We had come here according to the direction and counsel<br/>
of brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] before his death and that he would still have been<br/>
alive if the Twelve had been in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] when he re-crossed the river from<br/>
[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] to Nauvoo.</p>

<p>He spoke of the Saints being driven from place<br/>
to place and said the only way [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]] [[John Bullock Clark|Clark]] [[Samuel D. Lucas|Lucas]] [[Thomas Benton|Benton]] and all the leaders<br/>
of the mob could be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus would have been to have come forward voluntarily and let their heads be cut off and <strike>let</strike> their<br/>
blood run upon the ground and go up as a smoking in<strike>s</strike>cense before the<br/>
Heavens as an atonement but now they will be eternally damned.</p>

<p>All the Presidents and Governors of the United<br/>
States had rejected all our petitions from first to last. When the Saints<br/>
were driven from [[Illinois|Illinois]] to perish on the prairies then President [[James Knox Polk|Polk]]<br/>
sends for a draft of 500 men to go into the army. What for? That<br/>
they might be w<strike>or</strike>asted away and their wives and children he wasted<br/>
away that we might be entirely wasted away as a people. If the<br/>
brethren had not gone they would have made war upon us and the<br/>
Governor of [[Missouri|Missouri]] would have been ordered not to let us cross the</p>",
42658.0,281,1847-07-29,"<p>[[Missouri|Missouri]]. The raising of the Battalion was our temporal salvation at the time.</p>

<p>[[James Knox Polk|Polk]] will be damned for this act. He with many of the<br/>
Government had a hand in the death of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] and we will never cease our<br/>
exertions until the blood of the Prophets and Saints is avenged.</p>

<p>He said that he intended to have every hole and corner from<br/>

<p><u>Arrival of the Mormon Battalion</u><br/>
<u><time datetime=""",07/29/1847
42658.0,281,,""">July the 29, 1847</time>.</u></p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] with his brethren the Twelve and others<br/>
mounted our horses and started to meet the Battalion under the command<br/>
of Captain [[John Brown|Brown]].</p>

<p>Some of them were met about 4 miles from camp<br/>
and we continued on and soon met with Capts Brown [[Nelson Higgins|Higgins]] Liut. [[William Wesley Willis|Willis]] and<br/>
the train following them and I met brother [[James Bevin|Bevin]] who went from my family<br/>
into the army. There were about 140 of the Battalion and a company<br/>
of about 100 of the [[Mississippi|Mississippie]] Saints that came with them from [[Fort Pueblo, unorganized U.S. Territory|Pueblo]]<br/>
being about 60 waggons in all 100 horses &amp; mules and 300 head of cattle which<br/>
added greatly to our numbers.</p>

<p>We had a heavy shower of rain while we were<br/>
in the Kanyon which sent the water in the creeks from the mountains<br/>
with a rush and roar like thunder resembling the opening of a flood gate<br/>
The first rush of water came down with a front 3 feet high. The shower<br/>
spread over a good share of the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] where we were settled.</p>

<p>We returned at the head of the companies and<br/>
marched into camp with music and they took up their quarters between<br/>
our two camps on the bank of the creek.</p>

<p>While we had been exploring the rest of the<br/>
Pioneers had been farming putting in potatoes corn beans peas buckwheat<br/>
and preparing a garden for garden seeds. Today our garden was</p>",
42658.0,282,,"<p>divided off as each had need.</p>

<p>In the evening Brother [[Brigham Young|Young]] and the Twelve went to <br/>
the Warm Springs and bathed</p>

<p>Next day we met in Council — the Twelve<br/>
Capts  [[John Brown|Brown]] [[Nelson Higgins|Higgins]] [[William Wesley Willis|Willis]] and others and heard the statement of the officers<br/>
concerning the Battalion and their situation and counsel was given by<br/>
President Young what course to persue</p>

<p>It was deemed wisdom for Capt Brown <br/>
and others to go to the [[Bay of San Francisco, Mexican Cession Territory|Bay of San Francisco]] and report himself<br/>
men and the State and brother [[Samuel S. Brannan|Brannan]] was to go as their pilot</p>

<p>After the Council broke up we mounted<br/>
our horses and rode to the Warm Springs and visited the Hot Sulpher<br/>
Spring and on our return I visited the Battalion and then the planting<br/>
ground and found some of our potatoes had rotted and some were coming<br/>
up. Our corn was also up and our beans.</p>

<p>At 8 o'clock <strike>o</strike>in the evening all the<br/>
camp met together and was addressed for more than an hour by<br/>
President Young. He expressed his feelings freely concerning<br/>
the treatment of the Government towards us as on the 28th.</p>

<p>The meeting opened by the assembly with<br/>
a shout of Hosannah to God and the Lamb repeated three times<br/>
with its Amen. Brother Young said the Ancient of Days<br/>
was not as far off as many supposed.</p>

<p>On the Saturday the Battalion went to <br/>
work at the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and our Camp of Pioneers sowing and planting.</p>

<p>At <strike>About</strike> noon a company of about 20 Utahs<br/>
visited our camp. They came to trade with us and while doing<br/>
so one Indian struck another over the head with his gun and broke<br/>
it and the old chief whipped them both. In the afternoon<br/>
the one who had the gun broke over his head stole the others horse<br/>
and made off with him. The Indians followed and shot both<br/>
him and his horse dead and they returned to our camp an The<br/>
policy to be pursued with the Indians came up and President</p>",
42658.0,283,1847-08-01,"<p>[[Brigham Young|Young]] and others expressed their views</p>

<p><u>First Meeting In the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]]</u></p>

<p><u>Sunday <time datetime=""",08/01/1847
42658.0,283,,""">August the 1st 1847</time></u></p>

<p>The congregation assembled under the Bowery on the [[Temple Square, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple Block]]<br/>
at 10 o'clock and the meeting was opened by singing and prayer. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
first addressed the <strike>me</strike>congregation and then was followed by a discourse from [[Orson Pratt|Orson<br/>
Pratt]] upon the prophices of [[Isaiah (OT)|Isaiah]] and their fulfilment in our present location and<br/>
the building up of Zion.</p>

<p>When Elder Pratt concluded [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] read a <br/>
letter from the commanding officer of the Battalion who went with it to the<br/>
Pacific and he spoke in the highest terms of praise of the members of the<br/>
Battalion in all their proceedings. A letter was also read from Capt [[Jefferson Hunt|Hunt]]; and<br/>
then Brother Kimball made some remarks upon our relations with the Indians.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the revelation given at [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter<br/>
Quarters]] was read by Elder Willard Richards and received a unanimous vote and <br/>
then the congregation was addressed by Elder [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]. A vote<br/>
was taken to cease entirely trading with the Indians, and it was decided<br/>
to form all the encampments into one.</p>

<p>In the evening the Twelve met and decided<br/>
for brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] to go back with 3 others with him to meet<br/>
the camp get the mail and bring word concerning the Saints who were<br/>
following the Pioneers.</p>

<p>On the Monday Brother Benson started<br/>
and we commenced laying out the city beginning with the Temple Block<br/>
In forming the Temple Block 40 acres appeared so large that we held a council<br/>
to determine if it would or not be wisdom to reduce it to one half. [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]]<br/>
believed if we did it we should be sorry and would rather enlarge than diminish<br/>
Heber C. Kimball thought we should let it be as it was even if we set it<br/>
out to shrubery Amasa Lyman said George A. Smith had spoken his mind<br/>
we all ran in the same channel and President Young said we could easier</p>",
42658.0,284,1847-08-05,"<p>diminish than enlarge it afterwards and it was determined that we let it remain as<br/>
it was.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we again met upon the<br/>
subject and as it was considered that we could not do justice to 40 acres<br/>
to begin with we should limit the Temple and garden to 10 acres.</p>

<p>As we were under the necessity of returning<br/>
soon it was thought best to go into the mountains to draw logs to build<br/>
ourselves cabins as the ""dobie"" houses might not be ready for our use<br/>
Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] had commenced drawing out logs<br/>
for their buildings and brother [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and myself concluded<br/>
to join our efforts.</p>

<p>So on the morning of the <time datetime=""",08/05/1847
42658.0,284,,""">5th of August</time> I<br/>
took my axe and in company with brother Smith went to the mountain<br/>
about six miles distance with several men with us to assist in chopping<br/>
We found a grove of fir trees that we thought would answer our purpose<br/>
but we had to make a road and bridges across the creek to it. I<br/>
dreaded the job for it was a hard one and I do not exercise the prudence<br/>
I ought when I take hold of hard labour. We chopped <strike>and drew</strike><br/>
<strike>home to the Fort</strike> more than enough to build one house 16 feet square<br/>
and drew 25 logs home to the Fort. I was weary and my<br/>
hands blistered for I had done much the most work.</p>

<p>We started again next day with five teams<br/>
and 4 teams went also for Dr. [[Willard Richards|Richards]] and in the two days<br/>
we had cut and drawn 77 logs for our two buildings.</p>

<p>That morning I had arisen quite sore with<br/>
the labour of the previous day and on going into the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]]  for my<br/>
horses could not find them and we supposed the Indians had driven<br/>
them off for they had been in Camp during the night so horsemen<br/>
were sent out to drive in all the horses in the Valley and much to<br/>
our joy we found none had been stolen this Increased our confidence<br/>
in the Indians around us.</p>

<p>I had ridden 8 miles without a saddle<br/>
and was fatigued by it but after we had found our horses I saddled</p>",
42658.0,285,1847-08-06,"<p>my horse and took my axe and went on before the teams and cut down 5 large fir<br/>
trees before they came up and during the two days I laboured so hard that when<br/>
we got home I could hardly stand upon my feet and I went into my waggon<br/>
and threw myself on my bed to rest.</p>

<p>I had not been there but a short time before<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] called upon me and informed me that the Twelve were<br/>
going to the water to be rebaptized for the remission of sins to set example<br/>
to the whole Church and that the brethren would be called upon on Sunday<br/>
to follow the example.</p>

<p><u>The Twelve Re-baptized</u><br/>
<u><time datetime=""",08/06/1847
42658.0,285,,""">August the 6th 1847</time></u></p>

<p>We considered this a duty and a privilege as we had come into<br/>
a glorious [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] to locate and build up Zion. We felt like renewing<br/>
our covenants before the Lord and each other and we soon repared to<br/>
the water and President [[Brigham Young|Young]] went down into the water and<br/>
baptized all his brethren of the Twelve present and confirmed us and<br/>
sealed upon us our Apostleship and all the keys powers and blessings<br/>
belonging to that office. Brother Heber C. Kimball baptized<br/>
and confirmed President Brigham Young. The following were the<br/>
names and order of those present; Brigham Young Heber C. <br/>
Kimball [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] Wilford Woodruff<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]</p>

<p><u>Selecting Their Inheritances</u></p>

<p>In the afternoon of the next day the Twelve went on to [[Temple Square, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple Block]]<br/>
and picked out their inheritances. President Young took a block East<br/>
of the Temple and running South East to settle his friends around him;<br/>
Brother Heber C. Kimball took a block North of the Temple whereon to<br/>
settle his friends; Orson Pratt South of the Temple Block and running<br/>
South; Wilford Woodruff took a block cornering Temple Block and at</p>",
42658.0,286,1847-08-08,"<p>the South West corner joining [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratts]] block; [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] took a<br/>
block 40 rods below or West of Wilford Woodruff's and running S. West<br/>
to settle his friends and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] took one joinging the Temple<br/>
on the West and running due West. It was supposed that Brother [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
would take his on the East near President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] None others of the Twelve<br/>
<strike>of the Twelve</strike> were present in camp.</p>

<p>During the same evening the Twelve went<br/>
<strike>to City Creek</strike> To [[City Creek, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|City Creek]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] baptized 55 members<br/>
of the camp for the remission of their sins and they were confirmed under<br/>
the hands of President Young Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff George A. Smith<br/>
and Amasa Lyman: Brigham Young being mouth.</p>

<p><u>General Baptism of the Pioneers</u><br/>
<u><time datetime=""",08/08/1847
42658.0,286,,""">August the 8th 1847</time></u></p>

<p>Sunday Morning at six o'clock the Bishops repared<br/>
to the streams of water for the purpose of baptizing the whole camp<br/>
of Israel for the remission of sins and the renewal of their covenants<br/>
before the Lord.</p>

<p>Brothers [[Tarlton Lewis|Lewis]] [[Stephen H. Godard|Goddard]] [[Addison Everett|Everett]] [[Charles Shumway|Shumway]]<br/>
[[Erastus Snow|Snow]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] baptized and the Twelve confirmed them<br/>
There were two hundred and twenty four baptized and confirmed this morning<br/>
99 of whom I confirmed with my own hands. This made 288 in all<br/>
who had been re-baptized during the last three days.</p>

<p>The camp assembled as usual at 10 o'clock<br/>
for public meeting and was addressed by Heber C. Kimball who spoke<br/>
much to our edifycation. I followed and was never blessed with greater<br/>
liberty of speech.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we again met and partook<br/>
of the Sacrament. Brother [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] addressed the people<br/>
and was followed by President Brigham Young who was fe<strike>b</strike>eble in health<br/>
Afterwards 110 men were called upon to go into the adobie yard and<br/>
76 volunteered.</p>",
42658.0,287,1847-05-11,"<p>I spent the Monday in making a sawpit on the next ^day^ in preparing<br/>
timber for our dwellings in the Fort. It had been decided to enclose one block of <br/>
10 acres with adobie <strike>s</strike>and log buildings as a Fort.</p>

<p>The North East corner was laid out as follows:<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] 4 rooms [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] 2 [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] 5 rooms [[Willard Richards|Willard<br/>
Richards]] 2 rooms Wilford Woodruff 2 ^[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] 2 [[Amasa Mason Lyman|A. Lyman]] 2^ [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] 1: all the rooms were to be<br/>
14 feet wide and as long as we cho<strike>s</strike>ose. George A Smith and myself build<br/>
together.</p>

<p>Brother [[Robert Crow|Crow]] had a [[Milton Howard Threkeld|[grand]child]] drowned on the <time datetime=""",05/11/1847
42658.0,287,1847-08-13,""">11</time>th.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",08/13/1847
42658.0,287,1847-08-15,""">13th</time> the Twelve held council. Each one was to make<br/>
choice of the blocks that they were to settle their friends upon. Brother Brigham<br/>
took two tiers of blocks South through the city Brother Kimballs runs<br/>
North and N. W. [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] 4 blocks Wilford Woodruff 8 blocks George<br/>
A. Smith 8 and Amasa Lyman 12 blocks according to the companies<br/>
organized with them.</p>

<p>Next day 4 of the Messengers returned from<br/>
[[Bear River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bear River]] and [[Cache Valley, Idaho and Utah Territories|Cache Valleys]]. They had gone with Capt. [[John Brown|Brown]] who<br/>
had started with a company to [[San Francisco Bay, California|San Francisco Bay]] via [[Fort Hall, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Hall]].</p>

<p>The returned messengers brought a cheering<br/>
report of Cache Valley and the country between us and there. The soil<br/>
was rich well watered and well calculated for farming purposes and<br/>
Bear River ^Valley^ for grazing &amp;c.</p>

<p>The brethren also returned that went to [[Utah Lake, Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah<br/>
Lake]] to get fish and they found a mountain of granite good for building<br/>
running from 7 to 15 miles from camp. The Quorum of the<br/>
Twelve decided in council that the name of our city should be the [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|""City of <br/>
the Salt Lake""]].</p>

<p><u>Remarks by President Young</u><br/>
<u><time datetime=""",08/15/1847
42658.0,287,,""">Sunday August 15th</time></u></p>

<p>""I am going to day to speak upon the subject of the Patriarchal<br/>
Priesthood and by request of brother Crow say something upon the death of</p>",
42658.0,288,,"<p>[[Robert Crow|his]] [[Milton Howard Threkeld|[grand]child]] <strike>by drowning</strike> the other day. [[Brigham Young|I]] hope to speak so as to be understood.</p>

<p>There is a reality in eternal things as much as in<br/>
the things of time which we daily see with our eyes. When a man has<br/>
a dream or vision of eternal things it is an evidence of its truth as much as though<br/>
he saw it with his own eyes in one sense of the word.</p>

<p>The Lord has hid from man the things that<br/>
he knew before he came into the flesh that he might walk by faith<br/>
and prove himself while here. The Lord converses with man on the earth<br/>
in the form of a servant and by visions and dreams &amp;c but he never appeared<br/>
to man in the flesh in the fulness of his glory for He is as a consuming<br/>
fire and a mortal body would p<strike>a</strike>erish in an instant in His presence.</p>

<p>The Priesthood is again restored to the earth<br/>
to bring that which was lost. We do not receive all at once but we<br/>
receive grace for grace. When brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] received the Priesthood<br/>
he did not receive all at once. He was a Prophet Seer and Revelator<br/>
before he had the fulness of the Priesthood and keys of the Kingdom. He<br/>
first received the Aaronic Priesthood and keys from under the hands<br/>
of [[John (NT)|John]] the Baptist. He then had not power to lay on hands to confirm<br/>
the Church but afterwards he received the Patriarchal or [[Melchizedek (OT)|Melchisidick]] Priesthood<br/>
from under the hands of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] [[James (NT)|James]] and [[John (NT)|John]] who were of the Twelve<br/>
Apostles and were the Presidency when the other Apostles were absent.</p>

<p>From those Apostles Joseph Smith received<br/>
every power blessing and privilege of the highest authority of the Melchisidick<br/>
Priesthood ever committed to man on the earth.</p>

<p>Some have had fears that we had not power<br/>
to get revelations since the death of Joseph. But I want this subject from this<br/>
time and forever to be set at rest; and I want the Church to understand from<br/>
this day henceforth and forever that an Apostle is the highest office and<br/>
authority that there is in the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth.</p>

<p>From whom did Joseph receive his authority?<br/>
From just such men as set around me here -[<u>pointing to the Twelve Apostles<br/>
who sat with him</u>]- Peter James and John were Apostles and there <br/>
was no noise about their being Seers and Revelators though those</p>",
42658.0,289,,"<p>gifts were among them. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] gave unto me and my brethren the Twelve<br/>
all the Priesthood Keys power and authority which he held and those are powers which <br/>
belong to the Apostleship.</p>

<p>In Joseph's day we had to ordain Patriarchs. Could<br/>
we ordain men to authority greater than we held ourselves? No. But it is necessary<br/>
to have Patriarchs to bless the people that they may have blessings by the Spirit of<br/>
prophecy and revelation sealed upon their heads and their posterity and to know what awaits<br/>
their posterity.</p>

<p>Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Smith]] was the senior Patriarch in the<br/>
Church and first Patriarch in our day and afterwards [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] was the senior<br/>
Patriarch for his father sealed it upon his head. But w<strike>as</strike>ere the<strike>re</strike>ir power and authority<br/>
different from that of all Patriarchs in the Church? No. There were all alike in their<br/>
authority in blessing.</p>

<p>[[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] is spoken of in the Bible that he should come<br/>
in the last days to turn the Hearts of the fathers to the children and the children<br/>
to their fathers. The fulfilment of this Scripture is manifest in establishing<br/>
the Kingdom of God and Priesthood on the earth in the last days and those who<br/>
hold the keys of the Priesthood and sealing power have the Spirit and Power of<br/>
Elijah and it is necessary in order to redeem our dead and save our children.</p>

<p>There is much more importance attached to this<br/>
than parents are aware of.</p>

<p>In the loss of this [[Milton Howard Threkeld|[grand]child]] of Brother [[Robert Crow|Crow]] that was<br/>
drowned I felt that I could weep in sorrow if I gave way to my feelings; for<br/>
I realize it is a loss to the parents to loose little children. It is true all<br/>
children are saved. Their names are written in the Lamb's book of life<br/>
which was the case with every Spirit that takes a tabernacle on this earth<br/>
Their names were written there before the world was made and will there<br/>
ever remain until they sin against the Holy Ghost. It will then be<br/>
blotted out no more to be re<strike>at</strike>corded for ever.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this can Brother Crow get<br/>
that child again or any other persons their children except there is something done<br/>
for them on the earth by their parents? No they would not. They <strike>they</strike><br/>
would go to God who gave them but the parents ^on earth^ would not have them</p>",
42658.0,290,,"<p>The parents framed the body to be sure but the Lord gave the Spirit and what is the<br/>
body good for without the spirit? What then can be done? I will tell you<br/>
A man that has embraced the Gospel must go to some one who has the Priesthood<br/>
and keys and power of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] and must attend to ordinances for that child even<br/>
must be baptized for it as well as to have it sealed to him and through this medium<br/>
claim his child in the morning of the resurrection and the Lord will give it up<br/>
to him.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] had my children sealed to me in the Temple<br/>
except one that died and that I shall leave in the hands of the Lord until I have<br/>
another opportunity.</p>

<p>As soon as we get up some adobie houses for our families we shall go to work to build another [[Salt Lake City Temple, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]] and as soon as a [[Endowment House, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|place]] is<br/>
prepared we shall commence the endowments long before the Temple is built<br/>
and we shall take time and each step the Saints take let them take<br/>
time enough about it to understand it.</p>

<p>Everything at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] went with a rush<br/>
We had to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] with the trowel in one hand and the sword in the<br/>
other and mobs were upon us all the while and many crying out, ""O the<br/>
Temple cant be built!"" I told them it should be built. This Church<br/>
should not fall and the Lord said if we did not build it we should be<br/>
rejected as a Church with our dead. Why did He say it? Because<br/>
the Saints were becoming slothful and covetous and would spend their money<br/>
upon fine houses for themselves before they would put it into a house for<br/>
the Lord.  But we went at it and finished it and turned it over<br/>
into the hands of the Lord in spite of earth and hell and the brethren was <br/>
so faithful at it that we laboured day and night to give them their endowment.</p>

<p>The children want to be sealed to their parents and<br/>
parents to their children that they may have blessings in eternity which they<br/>
will stand in  need of.</p>

<p>God promised to [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] that his seed should be<br/>
as numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea shore and to<br/>
his seed there should be no end. This of course would continue to all<br/>
eternity the same blessings upon our heads if we are faithful for</p>",
42658.0,291,1847-08-21,"<p>our eyes have not seen nor our ears heard neither entered into our hearts the great things that<br/>
God has in store for us.</p>

<p>And when I look upon the great work the Elders of Israel <br/>
have to perform and look around upon them and see them vain and foolish, it makes<br/>
me sorrowful. They forget their calling. O ye Elders of Israel think for a <br/>
moment what manner of persons ought ye to be? men who hold the Priesthood and <br/>
keys of salvation and have power to go to the nations of the earth and say to the people<br/>
I have salvation for you and power to exalt you to celestial glory or if you reject<br/>
it to seal you unto damnation.</p>

<p>It is no trifling affair to have power put into your hand<br/>
to deal with the eternal destinies of the sons and daughters of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] who form<br/>
the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>While in the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple at Nauvoo]] we voted to cut off the<br/>
Gentiles who rejected the Gospel and killed the Prophets and it was recorded on earth<br/>
and it is recorded in Heaven. That nation will go down quickly!""</p>

600 waggons and were divided into 9 companies. I received three<br/>
letters from Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and one from [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]]. My [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]<br/>
was coming along but Mother [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Woodruff]] had gone back to [[Iowa|Iowa]] to<br/>
live with my sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] and her [[Dwight Webster|husband]].</p>

<p>We reached [[Fort Bridger, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Bridger]] on the <time datetime=""",08/31/1847

the first Fifty of the 6 hundred waggons: they belong to brother<br/>
[[Daniel Spencer|Spencer's]] Hundred. A meeting of the Camp was held in the<br/>
evening and addressed by [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C.<br/>
Kimball]] and Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",09/04/1847
42658.0,292,,""">4th</time> we travelled to [[Little Sandy Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Little Sandy]] and <br/>
<strike>to mar</strike> met Captain [[Perrigrine Sessions|Session's]] Fifty and also [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt's]] Fifty.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
convened together and we had one of the most interesting councils we ever heed [had]<br/>
together. At the commencement two of the quorum was<br/>
sharply reproved for undoing what the majority of the quorum had done</p>",
42658.0,293,,"<p>in the organization of the camps for travelling. At first it was not received but afterwards<br/>
the error was seen and confessed. Much teaching was given by President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
and the power of God rested upon us and our hearts were melted.</p>

<p>The President said if he did not tell us of our faults<br/>
we should be destroyed but if he told us of them and reproved us we should live in<br/>
love in love and our hearts be cemented together.</p>

<p>Brothers [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] had been to [[England|England]]<br/>
and done a good work but had returned to [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] and disorganized<br/>
the two divisions and companies that the quorum of the Twelve had spent the<br/>
whole Winter in organizing and which was also governed by revelation. Brother<br/>
Parley took the lead; and President Young chastized him for his course and<br/>
taught us principle. He said that when we set apart one or more of the<br/>
Twelve to go and do a certain piece of work they would be blessed in doing<br/>
that and the quorum would back up what they did, but when one or more<br/>
of the quorum interfere with the work of the majority they burn their fingers<br/>
and do wrong. When the majority of the Twelve plant a Stake of <br/>
Zion and establish a President over the Stake and appoint a High Council<br/>
has the minority of the Twelve one or more any right to go and interfere<br/>
with those councils? No; unless they should get corrupt and do wrong.<br/>
Then it would be the duty of any one of the Twelve to show them their error<br/>
and teach them what was right: and should the majority of those Councils<br/>
get corrupt and try to lead astray the people it would then be the duty<br/>
of any one of the Twelve to disannul those councils and call upon the<br/>
people to sustain him and appoint a new one; but while the councils<br/>
are trying to do right it would be the duty of the Twelve who might be<br/>
with them to assist in carrying out the views that the majority of the<br/>
Twelve had established.</p>

<p>The quorum all decided that Brother Parley Pratt<br/>
had committed an error in not carrying out the <strike>emigration</strike> ^organization^ as established by<br/>
the Twelve.</p>

<p>Brother Parley was led to confess his fault and the power<br/>
of God rested upon the whole quorum and President Young and that<br/>
he felt eternity upon him and was weighed down <strike>with</strike> to the earth with</p>",
42658.0,294,1847-09-07,"<p>this work and that brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] felt the weight of it more than any other man<br/>
except himself. He should chastise any one of the quorum when out of the<br/>
way. He had done it for their good and was constrained to do it by the <br/>
power of God.</p>

<p>Brother Heber C. Kimball addressed brother [[Brigham Young|Young]] and <br/>
wished him to rest as much as possible and let his brethren to bear his<br/>
burdens. He said he wanted brother Brigham to save himself for he <br/>
was wearing down. ""I feel tender toward you and want you to live<br/>
and if I or my brethren do wrong tell us of it and we will repent.""</p>

<p>Brother Brigham observed that there was not a better<br/>
lot of men on earth than the Twelve but when they needed it he should<br/>
chastise them that they might be saved.</p>

<p>Each of the quorum present expressed his feelings<br/>
and we all felt it good to be there for the Lord was with us.</p>

<p>Next day we travelled to the Springs and here met <br/>
three Fifties. Here I found in brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoots]] company my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]<br/>
and many from our Ward.</p>

<p>After supper we held a meeting of all the<br/>
camps when [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] Wilford Woodruff and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
addressed them. It was decided by vote to tarry over the morrow.</p>

<p>The Twelve held council on the day of our tarry<br/>
and settled some important matters and in the evening at Dr. [[Willard Richards|Richard's]]<br/>
we heard read the Epistle to the Saints in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake<br/>
Valley]].</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",09/07/1847
42658.0,294,,""">7th</time> we bade farewell to the Valley bound<br/>
companies and continued our journey towards [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]].</p>

<p>We travelled 14 miles and camped on the<br/>
[[Sweetwater River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Sweet Water]] with [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor's]] company and also [[Edward Hunter|Edward Hunter's]]<br/>
The ground was covered with snow which continued to fall till evening.</p>

<p>The Hundred prepared a feast for the whole<br/>
Pioneer Camp and furnished a table here in the wilderness in<br/>
fine style. Our feast consisted of roast and broiled beef</p>",
42658.0,295,,"<p>pies cakes biscuit butter Peach sauce coffee tea sugar and a great variety of good<br/>
things. In the evening the Camp had a dance but the Twelve met in council<br/>
at brother [[Vincent Shurtleff|Shirtliff's]] tent and transacted the business that came before them<br/>
for adjustment.</p>

<p>Fourteen miles were travelled farther on the morrow and<br/>
then we met brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M Grant's]] Hundred.</p>

<p>Brother Grant had burried a [[Margaret S. Grant|child]] on the road and<br/>
his [[Caroline Van Dyke Grant|wife]] lay at the point of death.</p>

<p>In the evening we held a council and heard from <br/>
Brother Jedediah the circumstances of the organization of the companies<br/>
and Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] said he was more than ever convinced that there was<br/>
wrong in this matter. Brother Grant also related his interview with<br/>
Col [[Thomas Leiper Kane|T Cane]] who had the Spirit of the Lord with him and was working<br/>
for us but [[Thomas Benton|Thomas Benton]] was our inveterate enemy and was doing <br/>
all he could against us.</p>

<p><u>Our Horses Stolen By The Indians</u></p>

<p>The alarm was given early next morning that a lot of<br/>
our horses and mules were stolen. Bells were found cut from the<br/>
horses the lariettes cut an arrow picked up and other Indian signs. The<br/>
trail was finally found and a company of 20 horsemen started after<br/>
the Indians.</p>

<p>It looked gloomy to see so many women and children<br/>
here in the mountains with their horses and cattle stolen and breaking<br/>
down so late in the season. Thirty horses were taken from the<br/>
Pioneer Camp and 20 from the other camps which was quite crippling<br/>
to us.</p>

<p>The camps remained together during the day<br/>
and in the evening assembled for meeting and was addressed by<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and Brigham Young.</p>

<p>During the evening 2 of our brethren returned who<br/>
had been in pursuit and brought back five of the horses. </p>",
42658.0,296,1847-09-21,"<p>Next morning we parted with our friends who were<br/>
going <strike>Hest</strike> ^West^ and those of us who had not lost horses divided with those who<br/>
had. As we journied on we met the remainder of our brethren returning<br/>
from pursuing the horses but they did not obtain any more of them. The<br/>
enemy had escaped with 43 of our horses.</p>

<p><u>Our Camp Attacked By 200 Indian Warriors</u></p>

<p><u><time datetime=""",09/21/1847
42658.0,296,,""">September the 21st 1847</time></u></p>

<p>Two weeks later than the time when the Indians stole so many<br/>
horses from us we had another immensely exciting Indian fray.</p>

<p>About 9 o'clock in the morning the call was made<br/>
to get our horses. I started for them in the timber half mile from<br/>
Camp. When I got about two thirds of the way to the horses<br/>
one of the most exciting scenes occurred I ever witnessed.</p>

<p>I hear several reports ^of  guns^ in quick succession<br/>
and our Guard cry ""Indians! Indians!""</p>

<p>In less than a minute the timber<strike>ed</strike> ^and^ bluffs were<br/>
lined with mounted Indians charging with all speed upon our guard horses<br/>
and camp. They shot at two or three of the guard but missed them<br/>
One of our guard <strike>they</strike> ^two of them^ took and tried to carry him off <strike>on his horse</strike>. He<br/>
knocked <strike>some of</strike> them down with his fist and got away. Some<br/>
of the brethren snaped their guns but they missed fire.</p>

<p>As soon as I heard the report of guns and<br/>
the cry of Indians and saw them driving off our horses and gathering thick <br/>
and fast upon every hand being without either horse or arms I ran<br/>
to camp with all speed and gave the alarm and called upon all to<br/>
gather their arms and mount their horses.</p>

<p>Brothers [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] [[William Matthews|Mathews]]<br/>
and several others sprang on to their horses with their guns and pistols<br/>
and ran to stop the horses which the Indians were taking away.</p>

<p>One party of Indians had driven <strike>five or</strike> ^about^</p>",
42658.0,297,,"<p><strike>six</strike> ^a dozen^ horses and mules over the hills. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] took after them. Two <br/>
Indians had gone over the Bluff with my horse and mule: Brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] took<br/>
after them and at the same time about 20 of our horses came rushing towards<br/>
camp frightened by the Indians. With great exertion President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and<br/>
one or two other brethren succeeded in stoping them and getting them into<br/>
our camp.</p>

<p>As soon as I arrived in camp I opened my trunk<br/>
took out my belt containing 8 pistols ^shots^ and <strike>harnessed</strike> ^buckled^ it on to myself as quick<br/>
as possible put a saddle and bridle on to a broken down horse for want of<br/>
a better one and mounted without spu<strike>p</strike>r or whip and gave chase after my<br/>
own horses. I could not ride very fast over the rough ground and bluffs<br/>
on a poor horse but I went as fast as I could.</p>

<p>As soon as I began to rise the bluffs I saw<br/>
Indians gathering thick on every hand closing in between me and the camp<br/>
As I passed one Indian he was priming his gun. But I continued the<br/>
chase.</p>

<p>While putting up a ravine with steep bluffs on<br/>
each side an avalanche of some 30 Indians rushed down upon me and<br/>
hedged me in so that I could not get out. Within a few feet of me<br/>
a large Indian drew a gun upon me. I presented a six shooter<br/>
at his breast and gave a yell which I had no sooner done than he<br/>
gave a whoop and ran up the hill and left me and all the other Indians<br/>
surrounding me followed his example and ran.</p>

<p>As soon as my horse and mule had got over their<br/>
fright and got out of sight of camp they tried to return to it and troubled<br/>
the Indians in driving them and brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] soon came near<br/>
them and one stoped and met him when they found they were overtaken<br/>
and professed friendship but the other still tried to drive off the horses<br/>
and brother Rockwood fired a pistol at him and he ran and the other<br/>
Indian did the same and brother Rockwood started my horses towards<br/>
me and I soon came to his assistance also some other brethren and<br/>
we catched them.</p>

<p>While this was going on nearly 40 Indians</p>",
42658.0,298,,"<p>surrounded brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and some of the brethren started to his assistance.</p>

<p>Indians were also upon every side ^of me^ until 2 got to<br/>
the camp and the brethren who had helped me had gone to the aid of<br/>
brother Kimball.</p>

<p>By this time 150 warriors had gathered close to<br/>
our camp all dressed in the greatest still for a war charge; and the <br/>
old chief began to address at the top of his voice the Indian band and<br/>
also our camp telling us that they were good Sionx and they had thought<br/>
we were Crows or Snakes.</p>

<p>When they found they could not get any more<br/>
of our horses and that three had been re-taken which they had stolen<br/>
they professed friendship. There were 11 horses in all taken by<br/>
the Indians who numbered about 200 warriors on the ground who<br/>
were well mounted and there were not more than 20 <strike>me</strike>of our men<br/>
including our guard who were engaged in any way against them<br/>
in stoping them or retaking our horses.</p>

<p>Brother [[Samuel Gould|Gould]] took one Indian horse<br/>
and all and another Indian brought back [[Thomas Woolsey|Thomas Woolsey's]] horse<br/>
which was among the stolen and exchanged him for the Indian<br/>
horse. This with my two horses were the only ones<br/>
retaken during the skirmish.</p>

<p>But when the Indian Warriors gathered<br/>
before our camp they saw that we as a body were armed and that we <br/>
knew them and had treated them kindly on our way to the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]].</p>

<p>The old chief then proposed that we smoke<br/>
the pipe of peace and said that if our chief pointing to President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
would go to their camp they would smoke with him and give up<br/>
the horses which his men had taken. Brother Brigham was not<br/>
well and we did not think it prudent for him to go.</p>

<p>While in this conversation with the Indians<br/>
Brother Kimball who had been out on the chase after the horses returned<br/>
bare headed (having droped his hat) accompanied by brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]]<br/>
and in riding into camp rushed his horse through the midst of the.</p>",
42658.0,299,,"<p>Indians and they fearing some treachery or that he was an enemy coming upon them<br/>
in the rear instantly leaped upon their horses scattered and dashed from the camp<br/>
some running into the creek and all appeared in great fright; but as soon as they<br/>
saw that no harm was designed they returned and took their places and had a<br/>
hearty laugh at their fright.</p>

<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] volunteered to accompany the<br/>
chief into his camp in the place of President [[Brigham Young|Young]] that we might get our horses<br/>
I volunteered and also [[Stephen Markham|Stephen Markham]] volunteered to go with Brother Kimball<br/>
on the expedition and so we three mounted our horses and set out accompanied by<br/>
a Frenchman who could speak a little Sioux language.</p>

<p>The Indians told us their camp was one mile<br/>
away but we travelled 7 miles over Bluffs and Valleys before we came <br/>
in sight of their camp some three miles distant moving towards us.</p>

<p>So we halted and waited for them and they<br/>
came and pitched about 100 lodges. Their were some 600 Indians men<br/>
woman and children and they brought with them about 1000 horses and mules<br/>
all of which we supposed were stolen from emigrants and other tribes. Their<br/>
encampment presented a very picturesque and amusing appearance.</p>

<p>Among their horses we readily descovered ours<br/>
which were stolen on the night we camped with brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant's]] company<br/>
We lost 49 that night and they were here in the drove which these<br/>
Indians had.</p>

<p>The old chief called ^together^ the war chiefs and placed<br/>
them on his left hand and ourselves on his right and set down upon the<br/>
grass and filled a long pipe with <u>Keunicken<strike>n</strike>isick</u> and smoke and passed <br/>
it to his chiefs; they smoked and passed it to us and we also smoked<br/>
in turn.</p>

<p>The old Chief then pointed to us to pick out our<br/>
horses which we undertook to do but we found it no easy task to pick<br/>
out 8 or 9 horses scattered through one thousand others for one or two<br/>
miles up the creek.  However after a labor^i^ous search we got all<br/>
but two that were stolen this morning. We then spoke to him<br/>
about the 49 horses which they had stolen from us before and</p>",
42658.0,300,1847-09-24,"<p>they acknowledged they had the horses <strike>but</strike>and gave us some <strike>ancouragent</strike> ^encouragement^ of letting us<br/>
have them when we got to [[Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]] but would not let us have them then<br/>
excepting only one. The brethren brought 3 bushels of salt as a present<br/>
to the chief. We returned to camp and this ended the scenes and business of the day.</p>

<p>We reached Laramie on the <time datetime=""",09/24/1847
42658.0,300,,""">24th</time> and<br/>
Brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]], [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] and myself dined with [[Mr. Burdow|Mr. Burdow]]<br/>
and talked to him about our stolen horses. He informed us<br/>
that our company with the ox teams lost every horse they had but they<br/>
got them back excepting five. He gave us some encouragement of<br/>
sending an Interpreter with us.</p>

<p>We crossed the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Platte]] and pitched our<br/>
camp about 3 miles from the [[Fort Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort]] and President Young called us together<br/>
and addressed us at some length and appointed 10 men to go and<br/>
visit the Indians to get our stolen horses and 25 men to follow after<br/>
to assist in case of necessity.</p>

<p>Next morning at 9 o'clock the first<br/>
company of 10 men commanded by Col. [[Stephen Markham|Markham]] started on their<br/>
Indian expedition and an hour afterwards the 2 of 25 men followed<br/>
<strike>han</strike>^under^ the command of Brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] but it was not long before<br/>
both companies returned having ascertained that a man had gone forward<br/>
to inform the Indians of our coming and to have them c<strike>k</strike>ache<br/>
up their horses.</p>

<p>In the evening we received word that Brothers<br/>
[[Luke Johnson|Johnson]] and [[Jesse Carter Little|Little]] had returned on the road to us and had fallen<br/>
in the with Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton|Stockton]] from the [[San Francisco Bay, California|Bay of San Francisco]] with<br/>
40 men going to the S[t]ates.</p>

<p>Next morning, Sunday, Brothers Johnson<br/>
and Little reached the Fort with two other brethren bringing us ten<br/>
horses for which we were indeed glad for we had as much as we<br/>
could do to get along and our horses were daily growing poor. Brothers<br/>
Young, Kimball and others dined at the Fort with Commodore Stockton.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we drove three miles</p>",
42658.0,301,1847-10-03,"<p>on our journey and camped.</p>

<p>We were now nearly out of bread and meat and this<br/>
was the case for some days to come but we killed a little and obtained some<br/>
meat from Mr. Benshaw <strike>the</strike> ^an^ Indian Trader and he promised to come over the<br/>
river with some Indians and kill some buffalo for us but we missed each<br/>
other and <strike>we</strike> did not have our buffalo hunt on the 1st of October for which<br/>
we had prepared. On this evening Com^m^odore [[Robert F. Stockton|Stockton]] arrived and said he<br/>
would like to journey with us but he changed his mind next morning and <br/>
concluded to travel on the North Side of the [[Platte River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Platte]].</p>

<p>We bought some half dozen horses of the Indian<br/>
trader.</p>

<p><u>Wonderful Discipline of a Buffalo Herd</u></p>

<p>In company of [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] I left camp on the <time datetime=""",10/03/1847
42658.0,301,,""">3rd</time><br/>
to get some meat. We started at daybreak and the wolves which had<br/>
rent the air during the night were dispersing in all directions as we rode<br/>
along and the beautiful swan in flocks were floating upon the Platte<br/>
adding beauty to the scene.</p>

<p>Soon a large herd of buffalo was in sight<br/>
and we left our horses and stole upon them the best we could and their<br/>
picket guards were frightened several times but we managed to re-assure<br/>
them. There is no well-diciplined army of men more particular<br/>
to have an old experienced guard on a close look out than a herd<br/>
of Buffalo.</p>

<p>By going under a bank we passed their guards<br/>
and <strike>lay</strike> ^<strike>lyn</strike>^ ^<strike>lying</strike>^ concealed until we were surrounded and the main bodies<br/>
were comming on to us with a heavy phalan<strike>s</strike>x of bulls meeting us<br/>
in the face with the cows fallowing in their rear.</p>

<p>When they were within a few rods of us we<br/>
thought it time to be up and doing for our own safety. I had a single<br/>
load in my rifle and a brace of pistols and Johnson a slide of six loads<br/>
in his rifle. He fired twice and they broke and ran. None were</p>",
42658.0,302,1847-10-05,"<p>killed. I then put a ball into a young cow. She hobbled off and I walked<br/>
over the ridge and shot her through the heart strings and lungs &amp; She<br/>
droped dead. [[Luke Johnson|Johnson]] mounted and rode some distance after the herd but my<br/>
cow was the only one we got. We travelled a <strike>er</strike>few miles farther and brother<br/>
[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] killed two more and an antelope. The meat was brought<br/>
into camp and divided. ^<strike>dev</strike>^</p>

<p>On the morning of the <time datetime=""",10/05/1847
42658.0,302,1847-10-08,""">5th</time> a company of 10<br/>
men were dispatched on foot to overtake the ox teams and stop them until<br/>
we should come up as our horses were breaking down. We learned from<br/>
a board stuck up on the way that they had tarried five days for us<br/>
and killed and dried 30 buffalo cows and they were still about one<br/>
week ahead of us.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",10/08/1847
42658.0,302,1847-10-16,""">8th</time> while we nooned we thought we <br/>
saw approaching in the distance a band of mounted warriors but<br/>
by the aid of our spy glasses we found them to be</p>

<p><u>A Band of Elk.</u></p>

<p>They made a splendid appearence. I went up a swail of tall grass<br/>
and the band came within 10 rods of me their horns waving above the<br/>
tall weeds like rocking chairs. I drew my gun for a doe; but<br/>
at this instant another man came up behind me and they saw him<br/>
and broke and ran. He shot after them but to no effect. They<br/>
ran near a Frenchman and he shot a doe and I got a piece of her<br/>
for supper. This was the first Elk I ever <strike>e</strike>ate.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",10/16/1847
42658.0,302,,""">16th</time> just before camping the <br/>
brethren returned whom we sent after the ox teams. They could not<br/>
gain upon them and all except two gave it up. Brother Luke Johnson<br/>
came near being trampled to pieces by a large herd of Buffalo travelling<br/>
in the night. They came upon him suddenly and he was<br/>
caught in their midst and they were 15 minutes passing him<br/>
The only way he had to keep them from trampling him down was<br/>
by striking out on each side with his stick punching them and yelling.</p>",
42658.0,303,1847-10-17,"<p>As they passed him they opened a lane in the herd just wide enough for him to<br/>
stand and he thus escaped being trampled to death.</p>

<p><u>Hunting Expedition</u></p>

<p><time datetime=""",10/17/1847
42658.0,303,1847-10-19,""">Oct. 17th</time></p>

<p>We were now pas<strike>s</strike>t the buffalo ground and as our camp had<br/>
not enough meat it was de<strike>a</strike>emed wise for a company of Hunters to return back<br/>
So about 20 of us including butchers and teamsters returned 10 miles with three<br/>
waggons and pitched our camp in a little timber on a slough and during the<br/>
evening we killed two buffalo.</p>

<p>After cutting the body of meat from the bones we roasted<br/>
them for our supper and breakfast and at the two meals we <strike>ate</strike> ^picked^ the bones of<br/>
of the two buffaloes. It is incredible what an amount of buffalo meat<br/>
a hungry man will eat without salt or bread and not make him sick. The<br/>
hump bones of a fat buffalo ro<strike>s</strike>asted is most delicious and the leg bones<br/>
are filled with marrow which we drank without bread. As we sat around<br/>
our fireside we should have <strike>been</strike> ^made^ a delightful picture for an artist<br/>
to have drawn.</p>

<p>At daylight in the morning 4 of us went to the<br/>
Bluffs to observe<strike>d</strike> the position of the herds. After breakfast we divided<br/>
into twos. [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] went with me and we saw while out<br/>
three wild horses and they were splendid looking creatures.</p>

<p>We found that the herds on the upland<br/>
were travelling to the N. &amp; N. E. and the only way to obtain meat was<br/>
for the hunters to confine themselves to the herds on the flat. Nine<br/>
buffalo were killed ^most of them by [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]^ but only seven of them were dressed and brought<br/>
into camp: the wolves feasted on the other two. We got counsel to<br/>
return to the main body early in the morning.</p>

We at first took them to be Indians on foot but we soon found them to be mounted<br/>
white men and we then thought they were troops. They came down upon<br/>
us with all speed and we stood ready with our arms in hand to meet<br/>
them; but when they came to our great surprise we found them to be<br/>
the police from [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] led by Brother [[Hosea Stout|Hosea Stout]]. They <br/>
informed us that 16 of them had come from Winter Quarters thinking<br/>
we might need some help. The remainder of the party had stoped with<br/>
our main camp.</p>

<p>We halted our teams returned with them to<br/>
our camping ground and prepared the brethren breakfast from our fat<br/>
Buffalo and they regaled us with information of our wives and families<br/>
We reached the Camp at 8 o'clock in the evening and had a pleasant<br/>
interview with the rest of our brethren from Winter Quarters</p>

shake hands with us as we passed along. Each drove to his<br/>
own home. Three days previous to my arrival I had<br/>

had brought forth in great abundance. The city was full of hay surrounded<br/>
with corn and plenty of veg<strike>e</strike>atables and buckwheat had grown.</p>

to Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]] and others to be taken by him. We also heard a letter<br/>
read from Capt. [[Dan Jones|Dan Jones]] of [[Wales|Wales]] who could represent in that land<br/>

<p>During the month of November much important<br/>
business and matter came before the Twelve and on the last of the<br/>

the Twelve as the First Presidency. Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] said<br/>
that by pursuing this course it would liberate the quorum of the Twelve<br/>

us much information concerning the nation the wars &amp;c. He brought<br/>

<p>Brother Brigham Young In This Council of the Quorum of the<br/>
Twelve Appostles of the Church brother Brigham Young its President<br/>
expressed his mind concerning the organization of the Church and the<br/>
appointing of a First Presidency. He wished all of the quorum<br/>
present to express their feelings and views upon the subject beginning<br/>
with the oldest and we did in the following order:</p>

<p>[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] Wilford Woodruff [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Amasa Mason Lyman|A Lyman]]<br/>
and [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]]; and then President Young followed.</p>

<p>After this Orson Hyde moved that Brigham<br/>
Young be President of the Church of Jesus Crist of Latter-day Saints<br/>
and that he nominate his two councillors to form the First<br/>
Presidency. Wilford Woodruff seconded it and the motion was<br/>
carried by the unanimous vote of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>

C. Kimball as his First Councillor which was seconded by<br/>
and carried unanimously. President Young then nominated<br/>
Willard Richards as his Second Councillor which was seconded by<br/>

over the whole Church.</p>

<p>Remarks upon several subjects were made by President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] among which were the following items:</p>

<p>Our children in this life do not look just like their parents but<br/>
they have a variety of looks. The offspring of celestial beings have spiritual<br/>
bodies.</p>

<p>He also said that the Twelve were at liberty to publish<br/>
papers in any part of the world where they should be or to take the best<br/>
course to spread the work. The Twelve should superintend the printing<br/>
wherever they where and if they were going abroad it will be well for<br/>
them to ordain Elders out of new members and take them to preach<br/>
and there should only one of the Apostles go to one place and call the<br/>
Seventies to their assistance.</p>

<p>In this same council it was decided that if a man<br/>
lost his wife he was at liberty to mary again where he pleased and<br/>
was justified; and [[William Wines Phelps|Wm W. Phelps]] was cut off from the Church for<br/>

day appointed we held this one of the most important conferences of<br/>
the Church.</p>

<p>The Conference opened at 10 o'clock this day<br/>
according to appointment. [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] opened by prayer and Wilford<br/>
Woodruff addressed the meeting upon the object of calling the<br/>
Conference and was followed by Orson Pratt upon the same subject.<br/>

<p>On the last and most important day of the Conference about 1000<br/>
souls were assembled in the Log Tabernacle.</p>

<p>[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] addressed the meeting in<br/>
the morning in the power of God and then the names of the Seventy<br/>
were called over and President [[Brigham Young|Young]] remarked that it would not be<br/>
necessary to put them to the meeting or to organized them into quorums<br/>
while here but to remain in a body under their Presidents until they <br/>
arrived at the Valley.</p>

<p>He said that any quorum of the Seventies<br/>
or the Twelve though scattered to the four corners of the earth and not<br/>
filled up in Zion yet as quorums would be full but when there was<br/>
a vacancy by death or apostacy then the vacancy might be filled.</p>

<p>From President Youngs teachings we learned<br/>
that it was necessary to keep up a full organization of the Church through<br/>
all time as far as could be: at least the First Presidency Quorum of<br/>
the Twelve Seventies and Patriarch over the whole Church.</p>

<p>It was then moved by<br/>
and seconded by and carried unanimously by the<br/>
body of the Church in Conference at Winter Quarters that Brigham Young<br/>
be the President of the whole Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day<br/>
Saints.</p>

<p>President Young then nominated Heber C.<br/>
Kimball to be his First Councillor which was seconded by<br/>
and carried unanimously.</p>",
42658.0,309,,"<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] afterwards nominated [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] as his<br/>
Second Councillor which was seconded by and<br/>
carried by a unanimous vote.</p>

<p>It was then moved by and<br/>
seconded by that President [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] be the Patriarch<br/>
over the whole Church.</p>

<p>Much important and interesting instruction was given<br/>
upon these and other subjects among which President Young spoke upon the<br/>
resurrection. He said there was nothing more to be learned by the people<br/>
upon the subject than what was written. It was made plain in<br/>
the Bible and other revelations and it was not a subject we wanted to<br/>
use at the present time as we had not come to the resurrection. There<br/>
was no person except a resurrected being who held the keys of the resurrection<br/>
Michael the Arch-angel or Ancient of Days who was Father [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] holds<br/>
the keys of the Resurrection.</p>

<p>The Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock on<br/>
the 6th day of April 1848.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year I had an interview<br/>
with President Young in the morning upon a variety of subjects among<br/>
which was that of my going East on a mission.</p>

<p><u>Sypnosis of 1847</u></p>

<p>The Twelve Apostles with their brethren 143 volunteers as<br/>
Pioneers had made a journey of more than one thousand miles to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky<br/>
Mountains]] and sought out a place for a city and a stake of Zion<br/>
that the Saints might have a place to flee to while the indignation<br/>
of the Law pass over the nation that had driven them out. We<br/>
had returned to [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] and with all our exposures sickness<br/>
and danger not a human life had been lost but all returned in<br/>
safety. The blessing of the Lord had been great upon</p>",

of [[Israel|Israel]] and throughout the whole earth. While the past year<br/>
had also shown the fulfilment of prophecy in wars rumours of wars<br/>
and the many gathering signs of the times. The United States had<br/>
been engaged in war with [[Mexico|Mexico]] involving themselves in a debt<br/>
of one hundred and fifty millions of dollars and a loss of twenty five<br/>
thousand men on their side and double that on the Mexican side<br/>

as God sent even the Shepherds while dishonest men would<br/>

Presidency it is robbing some of the rising generation or taking<br/>
away some one's rights but it is not so.</p>

Lord will cause the wrath of men to praise Him. The remainder<br/>
will the Lord restrain.""</p>",

upon the subject. Remarks were also made concerning the wives of the<br/>
Batallion staying at [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] <strike>on</strike> this season. It was thought the<br/>
soldiers would have to come back for their bounty money and if so that they<br/>
would wish to find their families here.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said that he was under the<br/>
necessity and obligation to do all he could for the soldiers families <strike>and</strike><br/>
and that what he had was at their command. ""And now what I want<br/>
to know is"" he said ""Will the Church take this responsibility from off<br/>
my sholders and let me go free?"" All said ""Yes.""</p>

<p>A committee of five were appointed to locate the<br/>
poor the widows and others needing care. The meeting then was<br/>

<p>The mildness of the Winter this year in</p>",
42658.0,318,1848-04-13,"<p>the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] had been very remarkable and Providential to the Saints who<br/>
had arrived only just before its approach. The most of the Winter<br/>
was in November and December and broke in the middle of<br/>
January. When they left <strike>onto</strike> ^at^ the end of that month grass<br/>
was three inches high and the horses mules and sheep were fat<br/>
and the Saints had put in 1500 acres of wheat and calculated<br/>
to do double that amount. Everything seemed prosperous. There<br/>
had been 10 deaths in all the Camp and many births. My<br/>

spent two or three hours with us very pleasantly. Mrs Woodruff<br/>
asked a blessing <strike>under</strike> ^at^ the hand of President Young. So he<br/>
with George A Smith and myself laid hands upon her<br/>

[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and on our way learned that there was  much excitement<br/>
at the [[Council Point, Iowa|Point]]. The inhabitants had laid off Council Point into<br/>
a town or town lots. One line fence ran through [[John Geen|John Geens]]<br/>
house and the people pulled down his fence to move it. He went<br/>
and put it up and took his rifle and swore he would kill the first<br/>
man who crossed the line of his fence or offered to touch it.</p>

<p>While the company stood looking at him<br/>
Brother [[Amos William Condit|Condit]] a shoemaker came out of his shop and walked up to<br/>
see what was going on and in doing so walked over the line and<br/>
John Geen shot him through the heart and he fell dead. A Frenchman<br/>
then struck Geen across the head and he fell as if he was killed<br/>
but he came to. They buried the dead brother and took his<br/>
murderer to [[Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa|Iowa city]] to be tried for his crime. He afterwards shot<br/>
himself in [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|G. S. L City]].</p>

<p>A letter came from the High Council<br/>
of [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] to the Presidency here. Our Valley<br/>

had inclosed 5000 acres of land within pale fences.</p>

he felt to bless the Saints who go on to the Valley or tarry at<br/>
Winter Quarters. He blessed the [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Potawattame]] land and<br/>
also said that the Saints never would be driven from the<br/>
Mountains except by insurrection among ourselves and he <br/>
had no fears of that.</p>

<p>Next day I rode five miles out with President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] to the Camp bound for [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]]. There were about<br/>
three hundred waggons in the encampment.</p>

<p>At this date and during the two or three weeks<br/>
before and later the brethren at [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] were very active in<br/>
preparing and organizing for their journey to the Mountain and some<br/>

had been for many months and Presidents [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
had to go on with their companies and leave him behind. Besides<br/>
he had not means to go with and I was waiting to see if I could<br/>

[[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] and again crossed the river to see President Richards.</p>

<p>Just as we landed the blowing of the<br/>
bugle the rush to arms and report that Indians were coming<br/>
upon the people created quite an excitement. About 80 men assembled<br/>
but they were in a poor state to resist an attack. No Indians<br/>
however came; and the people were addressed by [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa<br/>
Lyman]] George A. Smith and myself upon the necessity of being<br/>
well armed and prepared for Indian attacks while in an Indian<br/>
country. The men were required to met every night at sun-set<br/>
for drill.</p>

<p>The night previous to this the Omahas<br/>
came upon some Pawnees who were in the town and fired<br/>
arrows upon them which they returned with powder and ball<br/>
but none were killed.</p>

<p>On the Sunday I rode with my<br/>
family to the [[Kanesville Tabernacle, Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Tabernacle]] and President Richards laid his<br/>
curcumstances before the meeting. George A. Smith W. Woodruff<br/>
and [[Orson Hyde|O. Hyde]] urged the subject of our assisting President Richards<br/>
with waggons oxen &amp;c to follow on to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] and a<br/>
committee was appointed to go and obtain means for this purpose.</p>

<p>At the close of meeting I took the parting<br/>
hand with many of the Saints. Brother Richards blessed<br/>
me and said that the power of God should rest upon me on this<br/>
mission and that no power should prevail against me. Many<br/>
blessings he pronounced on my head.</p>",

drenched with rain.</p>

<p>Next day we reached [[Mount Pisgah, Union County, Iowa|Mount Pisgah]] and at night<br/>
held a meeting at that place which was addressed by [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]<br/>
and Wilford Woodruff, both constrained by the Spirit of God to speak<br/>
in much plainness to the people.</p>

<p>On the following day I had an interview with<br/>
[[Aaron York|Aaron York]] President of the Branch who laid before me the state of<br/>
affairs concerning himself and the Church at Mount Pisgah.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we held meeting. I addressed<br/>
the people and gave them counsel. Bro York followed and withdrew<br/>
from the Presidency of the Branch and we then appointed by the<br/>

Whiting and [[Oscar DeMille|Demill]] for his counsellors.</p>

was approaching us. My mules were tied to a large oak on<br/>
the opposite side of the street and I felt impressed to move them<br/>
away to another place and I did so. I also removed my</p>",

<p>We had just retired to bed when the storm<br/>
reached us with great fury and in a moment the large oak tree came<br/>
thundering to the ground with a terrific crash. Had I not have<br/>
moved my mules it probably would have killed them; had I not have<br/>
moved my carriage it would have crushed it to atoms and killed us for<br/>
the body of the tree fell where my carriage stood. It just<br/>
missed brother [[Brother Kingsley|Kingsleys]] waggon. I consider my impressions<br/>
an interposition of Providence to save our lives.</p>

then in company with [[John Snider|John Snider]] I visited the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and went<br/>
over it from the bottom to the top. Here I once more had<br/>
a full view of the once beautiful but now desolate city Nauvoo.</p>

<p>The Temple was in a much better state of<br/>
preservation than I expected to find it.</p>

<p>The people in the city of Nauvoo were<br/>
much excited from a report that Elder [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] would preach in the<br/>
Temple that day. They had made many threats upon the<br/>
subject and some came in waggons from the country to hear and<br/>
see; but the excitement was all among themselves for Elder<br/>
Hyde had given out no such appointment.</p>

<p>I returned to Almon W. Babbits and<br/>
found a man had come from [[Michigan|Michigan]] to enquire after<br/>
the Gospel and to see the Saints. I was introduced to him<br/>

had 18 acres of wheat which he wanted stacked. So he<br/>
rigged two teams and I took them into the field and during<br/>

upon 12 acres of ground and a young man loaded it for me and<br/>
brothers Scamman and [[Dominicus Carter|Carter]] put it into stacks as fast as<br/>
we brought it in. Good judges said it would yeild [yield] 25<br/>

It was a very hot day and I was not in good health. It was<br/>
as much as a well man ought to have done in two days and<br/>

feeling unhappy and knowing not what course to take.</p>

<p>I rode to [[Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Lowell]] on the <time datetime=""1848-0829"">29th</time> and visited<br/>
the Iron Foundries &amp;c; and in the evening met with the few Saints<br/>
at that place.</p>

<p>Next day I parted with Bro Hardy he for<br/>
[[Peterborough, Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Peterborough]] and I for Boston to my family. Here I tarried with<br/>
the Saints until the <time datetime=""",09/04/1848

with Elders [[Alfred Cordon|A. Corden]] [[Beri Lewis Robbins|Lewis Robins]] and [[Nathaniel Henry Felt|N. H. Felt]] present.</p>

<p>On the 4th I and my family left Boston<br/>
in the express train for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]. Through some misunderstanding<br/>
the two trains waited for each other 3 or 4 hours so we did<br/>
not get into Portland till 1 o'clock at night. We found our<br/>
brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus F. Carter]] waiting for us and he took us home and<br/>
we spent with him the night.</p>

<p>Next day we called upon our brother<br/>
[[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra Carter]] and family and ascertained that Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter]] had<br/>
been in the day before to carry us out home with him but not<br/>
finding us he went away quite disapointed. So Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]]<br/>
thought it best to go out to her fathers house to see her aged<br/>
father once more and she took stage and went out and spent</p>",
42658.0,328,1848-09-12,"<p>the night with him. He was quite out of health but got well almost<br/>
immediately as soon as he saw her. He was 76 years of age and<br/>
a visit from his daughter [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] was like as from one rose from the<br/>
dead</p>

<p>I left [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]] with my children next day and rode<br/>
to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] to Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carters]] and was glad to once more see<br/>
him and sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss]] and their families</p>

Rhoda on the way.</p>

<p>Here [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Sarah B Foss]] Phebe Woodruff<br/>
and [[Shuah Coffin Carter Moulton|Shuah C. Moulton]] all our sisters had the privelege of<br/>
meeting once more together. It had been 8 years since they<br/>
had met before. It was a happy family union.</p>

<p>Freedom Moulton had a good form of 100 acres<br/>
and had taught school 120 months. He and his wife Mrs<br/>
Woodruff's sister treated us kindly during our visit. We parted<br/>
from them on the <time datetime=""",09/19/1848

<p>The day after our return we had a family<br/>
meeting in the evening at Father Carter's. Our father was<br/>
present also our brother [[Joseph Fabyan Carter|Joseph Fabyan Carter]]. We had a good<br/>
time. I expressed my feelings in plainess concerning my<br/>
course and the dealings of the Lord with and and Phebe did the<br/>
same and said that her parents and friends would know in eternity<br/>
why she had taken the course she had in leaving her father's<br/>
house and following the Saints. The Spirit of the Lord<br/>
was with us. Brother Fabyan Carter spoke for a few<br/>
minutes and Father Carter said he was satisfied with us and<br/>
if there was a society of Saints where he could spend the few<br/>
remaining days of his life which he had to spend on Earth</p>",
42658.0,329,1848-09-23,"<p>[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|he]] should be glad to. It was an interesting time to us all.</p>

for [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] where I spent a few days in the performance of my ministeral<br/>
duties among the Saints.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",09/27/1848
42658.0,329,1848-09-30,""">27th</time> I was at [[Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. There was<br/>
a cattle show there on that day; and here were some of the finest oxen<br/>
I ever saw in my life. I saw one large ox that girted 10 feet<br/>
and weighed alive 4200 pounds; two Durham oxen which were two of<br/>
three twins calved at a time 2200 lbs each; a mamouth Durham cow<br/>
girt 8 feet, weight 2500 lbs; and other remarkable specimens in the<br/>
cattle line.</p>

<p>In the evening I took the cars to [[Northbridge, Worcester County, Massachusetts|Northbridge]]<br/>
We were loaded down alomst to suffocation and the cars croweded out on<br/>
the platforms until the people were in danger of falling off.</p>

<p>I stayed with the Saints at Northbridge<br/>
over the next day and returned to Worcester. Here I visited the<br/>
insane hospital which contained about 500 occupants. Their appartments<br/>
were neat clean and comfortable. Bro [[Jesse Haven|^Jess^ Haven]] went through<br/>
the Asylum with me.</p>

<p>I arrived at [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] on the <time datetime=""",09/30/1848

preached to them. The Presiding Elder was gone and I recommended<br/>
Bro [[Thomas Cartwright|T. Cartwright]] for that position and we appointed him and I <br/>
ordained him to the office of an Elder. The records represented<br/>
at this time 65 members in the New York Branch</p>

<p>I spent several days with the Saints of<br/>
New York visiting them &amp;c and then left for [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on<br/>

<p>Next day I called upon Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]] clerk <br/>

his office yet as soon as he saw me he laid aside all<br/>
other business and came and grasped my hand and seemed</p>",
42658.0,330,1848-10-05,"<p>much delighted to see me. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|He]] talked with me about 15 minutes <strike>about</strike> <sup>upon</sup><br/>
a variety of subjects and I then retired from his office.</p>

<p>There was quite a display to day the <time datetime=""",10/05/1848

in [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in depositing the remains of Comodore [[James Biddle|James Biddle]]<br/>
in the vault of the Biddle family. This was done with military<br/>
honours. There were about 20 military companies and three<br/>
bands of music accompanied with a dislay of flags from<br/>
public buildings chiming of bells firing of minute guns from<br/>
the navy yard &amp;c. Commodore Biddly is the eleventh <br/>
Commodore buried in Philadelphia up to this date and the<br/>
8th or ninth who had died there. Those preceding him<br/>
were Commodores [[Stephen Decatur Jr.|Decatur]] [[William Bainbridge|Bainbridge]] [[John Barry|Barry]] [[Thomas Truxtun|Truston]] [[John Shaw, b. 1773|Shaw]]<br/>
[[Isaac Hull|Hull]] [[John Rodgers|Rodgers]] [[David Porter|Porter]] [[Jesse Duncan Elliott|Elliot]] and [[Alexander James Dallas|Dallast]].</p>

<p>Two days later Elder [[William Ivins Appleby|W. J. Appleby]]<br/>
and myself again called upon Col Kane. His office was full<br/>
of business men but as as soon as he saw me he came directly<br/>
as cordially as before and conversed with us with deep interest upon<br/>
our cause. He said he had fears that there was trouble<br/>
brewing against us in the West of [[Iowa|Iowa]] and he wished me to<br/>
give him the earliest information of anything against us.</p>

<p>On the Sunday I met the Saints<br/>
with many strangers in the old Mormon Hall or Marshall<br/>
Hall. I addressed them in the morning from the words<br/>
of Jesus to his disciples that ""as it was in the days of [[Noah (OT)|Noah]]<br/>
and [[Lot (OT)|Lot]] so also should it be in coming of the Son of Man. I<br/>
had the power of God with me during the day.</p>

Brooklin several times in the interval.</p>

<p>The following is an extract of a letter written by<br/>
me to my wife on the 18th:</p>

<p>""I have been much blessed with the Spirit of<br/>
God since I saw you. I have felt more of the presence and power of<br/>
God with me than I expected to have enjoyed on this Eastern mission<br/>
I have felt that some one has prayed much for me of late. I wonder<br/>
if it was [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]? I know you pray much for me. I feel its power<br/>
and prize it much. I have never felt such a desire to prove worthy<br/>
of your confidence and trust, shun every appearance of evil keep out<br/>
of the path of all temptation and do right in all things as I have<br/>
of late.</p>

<p>""I have had much of the spirit of secret prayer,<br/>
have poured out my soul in supplication before God with tears of joy<br/>
while the visions of my mind have been open at times to see<br/>
clearly my duty to my God, to my wife and children, to the<br/>
Saints and the world at large.</p>

<p>""I have also seen the awful and certain<br/>
judgements of God which like a gathering storm are ready to burst<br/>
upon the whole Gentile world, especially this nation who have<br/>
heard the sound of the Gospel rejected it with all the testimony<br/>
of the servants of God stoned and killed the Prophets become<br/>
drunk with the blood of martyrs and Saints and at last driven<br/>
the entire Church with the Priesthood and keys of Eternal life<br/>
out of their midst into the Wilderness and Mountains of [[Israel|Israel]]<br/>
By so doing they have turned the last key which seals their<br/>
condemnation which lingereth not and their damnation which<br/>
slumbereth not: therefore they cannot escape. Not only<br/>
the Holy Ghost but that portion of the Spirit of God that</p>",
42658.0,332,1848-10-21,"<p>enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, which like a faithful<br/>
ambassador who has finished his work, is rapidly takings it flight from<br/>
Gentile America and Wo! Wo! Wo is their doom"".</p>

<p>I was at [[New Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven]] on the <time datetime=""",10/21/1848
42658.0,332,1848-10-23,""">21s</time>t. I <br/>
called at Mr [[Smith Tuttle|S. Turtles]] and found Sister [[Rachel Gillett Tuttle|Turtle]] sick. She was as<br/>
yellow as saffern. A number of comforters like those<br/>
those who came to [[Job (OT)|Job]] [##Job 2:11##] called upon her and reproached her<br/>
because she was sick inasmuch as she professed to believe<br/>
in God and asked why she did not call upon her Elders<br/>
to heal her. This was done to reproach her and she spoke<br/>
out and said, ""O that the Lord would send brother Woodruff here.""<br/>
This was but a few moments before she received a note from<br/>
me stating that I was coming and when I laid hands upon<br/>
her she was healed indeed and I felt to praise the Lord.</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday and I met<br/>
with the Saints at Father [[Jarius Sandford|Jairus Sandford]] and among others<br/>
present was Mr Smith Turtle and his wife who was healed the<br/>
day before. Soon after she left home her daughter came<br/>
to the house to take care of her supposing her to be very low<br/>
but found she had gone to meeting. I preached twice<br/>
during the day with the Spirit and power of God and in<br/>
the afternoon administered the Sacrament</p>

<p>Before I left this place I felt strongly<br/>
impressed by the Spirit of the Lord to ordain Elder Jurius<br/>
Sandford to the office of High Priest and Patriarch which I did<br/>

<p>A Great Day at [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]]</p>

<p><time datetime=""",10/25/1848
42658.0,333,,""">Oct 25 1848</time></p>

<p>I took the rail at [[North Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut|North Haven]] and arrived in Boston at 12 o'clock<br/>
and got into an Omnibus to go to [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] but was blocked up<br/>
by the great procession marching through the city in celebration of the<br/>
introduction of the water from the Long Pond into the city of Boston.</p>

<p>This procession was two hours and 30 minutes<br/>
passing any given point and was considered the grandest display ever<br/>
made on any occassion in an American city and there was supposed<br/>
to be more people in Boston than ever known before. The procession<br/>
itself was said to be 7 miles long. Archways were formed across<br/>
the streets decked with evergreens and flowers and a pyramade<br/>
of evergreen and flowers overtop bearing a great variety of mottos.</p>

<p>The procession started from the [[Boston Common, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Common]]<br/>
15 minutes past 12 at noon. First came a powerful band of<br/>
Lancers. Then followed 30 military companies in full uniform<br/>
and several <strike>other</strike> bands of music. Next came the fire companies<br/>
of the city with their engines ornamented with wreathes flowers &amp;c;<br/>
following were the fire companies from the neighboring towns<br/>
After these came a cavalcade of 500 gentlemen and a few ladies<br/>
A boy's fire engine drawn by two ponies was followed by<br/>
two of the largest size water pipes mounted on a platform<br/>
drawn by seven black horses bearing the inscriptions: ""First<br/>
pipe laid April 19th 1847"": ""Water introduced into the city Oct 25<br/>
1848.""</p>

<p>After this came a brick layers platform<br/>
with impliments of their trade followed by a host of workmen.<br/>
Next were the Boston Boat Clubs with their boats and after<br/>
these the Boston Port society with a ship fully rigged and</p>",
42658.0,334,,"<p>manned under the command of Father [[Edward Thompson Taylor|Taylor]]: the[[Salem, Washington County, New York|Salem]] East Indian<br/>
Marine and the old Marine societies followed bearing in their ranks<br/>
the old Palanquin which had <sup>not</sup> been seen in public for 40 years<br/>
This was borne by 6 stout Negroes. In a carriage drawn by<br/>
4 horses was a large full rigged moddle of the famous but unfortunate<br/>
privateer the Grand Turk. Other carriages followed containing<br/>
specimens of American clocks goods carpeting &amp;c.</p>

<p>After these came Oak Hall expresses<br/>
Adams &amp; Mrs Ridders. A printing office passed on<br/>
wheels with workmen all at work strewing papers cards &amp;c among<br/>
the mass as they proceded onwards followed by Faneuil Hall<br/>
market in minature with a grand display of beef mutton pork<br/>
fowles fish vegitables &amp;c which I presume was a temptation<br/>
to the hungry crowded lookers on. The market men came next<br/>
in great force with badges on their hats.</p>

<p>A stuffed Elephant passed mounted upon<br/>
a carriage with 3 persons riding on his back; also an artifical<br/>
flower manufactory drawn by 6 horses containing 12 young girls<br/>
dressed in white all busy making flowers. There was an<br/>
apple tree filled with fruit with [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] and [[Eve (OT)|Eve]] picking it and<br/>
the serpant on the tree. All the Masonic and Odd Fellow's<br/>
societies of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] were in the procession and hundreds of flags<br/>
making a costly array were brorne [borne] onwards.</p>

<p>The first Division of the Procession was<br/>
under the direction of the honourable [[John C. Park|John C. Park]] and consisted<br/>
of the [[Josiah Quincy IV|Mayor]] of Boston Committee of Arrangements; Water Committee<br/>
Water Commisioners &amp; Engineers, Aldermen, President of the<br/>
Common Council, Members of the Common Council, High</p>

<p>Sheriffs of the State; the [[George Nixon Briggs|Governor]] and suite &amp;c, &amp;c, escorted<br/>
by the Boston Cadets and flanked by the city Greys. After<br/>
these was a long array of civil and military functionaries,<br/>
representatives of foreign countries bearing the tri colorured flag,<br/>
the Clergy, Medical Faculty, Editors, Members of the bar</p>",
42658.0,335,,"<p>Governments of the Neighbouring cities students of [[Harvard University, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Harverd University]], Mercantile<br/>
Library Association in full array and scores of other companies too numerous<br/>
to name.</p>

<p>All along the route of the Procession the public<br/>
buildings hotels and private residences were crowded with human beings<br/>
and the [[Boston Common, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Common]] was literally covered.</p>

<p>At half past 4 o'clock the Government of the<br/>
city headed by the [[Francis Tukey|chief marshal]] reached the Common and took their seats<br/>
on a decorated platform in the centre of the reservoir after which lengthy<br/>
speeches were made by the Mayor and Mr [[Nathan Hale|Hale]]. At the close<br/>
of the speeches the Mayor arose and said:</p>

<p>""Fellow citizens, it is proposed to admit the<br/>
waters of [[Lake Cochituate, Massachusetts|Lake Cochituate]] into the city. All those in favour<br/>
will say Aye!""</p>

<p>The response was in a voice of thunder. The<br/>
signal was then given and upwards gushed a pure column of water<br/>
8 inches in diameter 80 feet into the air and falling again into<br/>
the reservoir. The cheering of the people at this moment was<br/>
overwhelming. The night was passed with fireworks and<br/>
illuminations.</p>

<p>While beholding these things going on the<br/>
words of the Lord came with weight upon my mind which says<br/>
""Broad is the road that leads to death and thousands flock together<br/>
there while wisdom shows a narrow path with here and there<br/>
a traveller,"" I went to Brother [[Alexander Badlam|A Badlams]] and spent<br/>
the night.</p>

<p>Next day I took train with brother [[Nathaniel Corey|Nathaniel<br/>
Corey]] to [[New Bedford, Bristol County, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] and read an account of the burning of the<br/>
[[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] by our enemies.</p>

<p>After visiting the Saints at various places<br/>
and attending to Church affairs I reached [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] again and<br/>
found my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children at her sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss |Foss']]</p>

<p>Sypnosis of 1848</p>

<p>During this year of our Lord 1848 the ""Fig Tree"" hath<br/>
rapidly put forth her leaves and blosomed for the summer. It<br/>
is a year which has laid the foundation for the fulfilment of<br/>
more prophecy and revelation than has been fulfilled in centuries<br/>

overturned the power of the [[Pope Pius IX|Pope]] of [[Rome, Lazio, Italy|Rome]] broken and he driven<br/>
from the papal dominion; and All the nations of the earth have<br/>
been convulsed. Revelations wars anarchy and confusion have<br/>
followed each other in rapid succession; cholera plagues and<br/>
famine came in the train and last of all though not the least<br/>
in importance the foundation is laid for the dissolution<br/>
of the American Government. While these things were<br/>
going on a spirit has prevailed for the return of the Jews<br/>
and the rebuilding of [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]; some 7000 Latter-day Saints<br/>
have gathered into the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|valley]] of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] by the [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Great<br/>

[[France|France]]. The people rose <u>en</u> <u>masse</u> and had a three days</p>",
42658.0,338,,"<p>^fight^ at the end of which they drove [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philipi]] out of [[France|France]] with all the<br/>
royal family. The people entered the T[ourelles] took the throne<br/>
upon their shoulders carried it into the streets and dashed it to pieces<br/>
on the ground. They then undertook to establish a Republican<br/>
government.</p>

<p>It was said that in the first 3 days fight<br/>
there were only 500 killed; but afterwards a reaction took place with<br/>
a fight and some 15000 killed. Finally they organized a government<br/>
and at the end of '48 the world was anxiously waiting the election of<br/>
a President of the French Republic and prophesying much future<br/>
bloodshed before the issue of this revolution was reached.</p>

<p>The German States and [[Prussia|Prussia]] next<br/>
followed in revolution. [[Austria|Austria]] arose and drove her [[Ferdinand I|king]]<br/>
from his throne but he afterwards returned with his armies<br/>
and bombarded [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] 8 days and reorganized his kingdom<br/>
giving to his people a milder form of government and more<br/>
toleration and still his throne was in danger.</p>

<p>The [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperior]] of [[Russia|Russia]] had also much<br/>
war and his throne was in some uncertainty the Irish had<br/>
made a struggle to throw off the British yoke but failed. The<br/>
inhabitants of [[Rome, Lazio, Italy|Rome]] had risen up in their might and compelled the<br/>
[[Pope Pius IX|Pope]] to change after change and at last dashed his power to the<br/>
earth assassinated his councillors and driven ^him^ from the Papal<br/>
chair which has stood unshaken for centuries and he has sought<br/>
protection by fleeing to other nations.</p>

<p>While this was going on in foreign<br/>
countries turn our eyes for a moment to America. She was<br/>
a nation blessed above all other nations under heaven yet she<br/>
had recently shed the blood of Apostles Prophets Patriarchs<br/>
and Saints and had suffered mob rule to take the place<br/>
of Constitution law and order. And what position is he<br/>
in at the close of this year. One of her States [[Ohio|Ohio]] has<br/>
disgraced herself by her Legislature sitting for weeks in</p>",
42658.0,339,,"<p>fighting for mastery instead of organizing and doing the business of the<br/>
people; and the leaders of the whole nation herself at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] had<br/>
also been <strike>engaged in</strike> ^engendering^ the spirit of party strife hatred disunion and war<br/>
They had met in seperate parties laying plans for the disolving of the<br/>
Union and the anihilation of the American Government and while<br/>
the Senators and Statesmen of the Slave States have met in convention<br/>
and resolved that if slavery in the District of Columbia was abolished<br/>
or prohibited in [[California|California]] they would immediately disolve the<br/>
Union lay Taxes upon the shipping of the free States &amp;c, the citizen<br/>
and Statesmen of the free States had also met and had resolved upon<br/>
the struggle between North and South unless they could carry their<br/>
measures.</p>

<p>Yet while parties were growing more and<br/>
more determined and divided the public mind seemed to be blinded<br/>
as to the result of these movements and ignorant of the fruit which<br/>
would grow up from the seed of their own sowing. They had<br/>
eyes but saw not, ears but hear not, hearts but do not understand.""<br/>
But the servants of God and his Prophets have seen the end with<br/>
as much certainly as did [[Noah (OT)|Noah]] [[Lot (OT)|Lot]] and Jesus the things<br/>
concerning [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] Sodom and Gomorrow [Gomorrah] and the antedelivuan<br/>
world.</p>

<p>During the past year also the Asiatic<br/>
cholera had marched through the earth had arrived in the<br/>
States and was sweeping down its thousands daily.</p>

<p>Turning our eye towards Zion on the other<br/>
hand the Lord had been favouring for. The Church of<br/>
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been organized with<br/>
a First Presidency—namely [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] who had gathered to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] of<br/>
Israel in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] of the [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]] took with<br/>
them about 3000 souls some 8000 head of  cattle making<br/>
at this date a population of about 7000 Saints in the City<br/>
of the Great Salt Lake; while those of the Brethren who</p>",
42658.0,340,,"<p>had located near the [[San Francisco Bay, California|Bay]] of San Francisco had discovered mines of wealth<br/>
in gold and other precious and useful ore which had created an immense<br/>
excitement throughout the world.</p>

<p><u>My Travels in 1848</u></p>

<p>I travelled during this year 4850 miles</p>

<p><u>Meetings &amp; Councils</u></p>

<p>I attended with the Twelve Apostles 12 Councils<br/>
and I held during the year of public meetings 44</p>

<p>I baptized 14 persons confirmed 14 ordained to<br/>
the office of Patriarch [[Jarius Sandford|Jurious Sanford]] aged <strike>88</strike> 85 and also<br/>
ordained one President of the Seventies.</p>

<p>Administrations &amp; Blessings</p>

<p>I administered to 20 sick persons some of whom were<br/>
remarkably healed and glorified God and I blessed according<br/>
to the order of the Church 10 children.</p>

<p>I wrote 60 Letters and received 39.</p>

<p>Thus had been the events and general affairs of the world<br/>
of the Church and myself during the year 1848 and the<br/>
Spirit whispered to me that the year eighteen hundred and<br/>
forty nine would be a year of calamities and moment<br/>
to the nations of the earth.</p>",
42658.0,341,1849-01-01,"<p>On Monday morning the <time datetime=""",01/01/1849
42658.0,341,,""">1st day of the year 1849</time><br/>
the Steamer Europia arrived bringing news of the election of Prince<br/>
[[Napoléon III of France|Louis Napoleon]] as President of the [[France|French Republic]]; also of the <br/>
abdication of the Emperor of [[Austria|Austria]] in favour of his young<br/>
nephew and of dreadful starvation in [[Iceland|Iceland]] and the raging<br/>
of the Cholera in [[Europe|Europe]]. Tidings also from [[South America|South America]]<br/>
was of a similar character. At [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] the cholera was<br/>
raging to such a frightful extent that the inhabitants were<br/>
fleeing business suspended captains mates clerks and hands<br/>
dying off and the steamboats had to stop running.</p>

<p>I received a letter brought by brother<br/>
[[William Goodridge|Goodridge]] from brother [[Josiah Gile Hardy|Josiah G. Hardy]] wishing me to visit a<br/>
sister who was possessed of an evil spirit so I accompanied<br/>
him to [[West Newbury, Essex County, Massachusetts|West Newbury]] 40 miles.</p>

<p>I tarried around this neighbourhood<br/>
until the 8th and then returned to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] to my family.</p>

<p>Next day I received letters from<br/>
[[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] and [[Dan Jones|Dan Jones]] from [[England|England]]. Brother Jones</p>",
42658.0,342,,"<p>expressed his feelings on warm terms concerning my letters to him and<br/>
said he felt encouraged by them to go ahead in the name of the Lord.<br/>
He informed me that he had raised up a Branch at [[Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorgan, Wales|Myrther]] of over<br/>
800 members and the total of members of the Churches raised up by<br/>
him in [[Wales|Wales]] was 2747.</p>

<p>The whole representation of the Churches in<br/>
[[England|England]] ^[[Scotland|Scotland]] and Wales^ represented at the General Conference at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] Aug 14th<br/>
1848 amounted to 350 Branches 929 Elders 1185 Priests,<br/>
608 Teachers 341 Deacons, 17902 members. There had<br/>
been added since May 31st 1846, 8467 souls to the Church<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] was now the President of the Churches in the<br/>
[[British Isles|British Isles]].</p>

<p>Elder [[Dan Jones|Dan Jones]] added ""I have<br/>
published in the Welsh language 48 different kinds and<br/>
size of pamphlets comprising more original matter than the<br/>
Book of Mormon Doctrines and Covenants and voice of<br/>
Warning and have circulated one million eight hundred<br/>
thousand of pages all of which preach night and day to<br/>
rich and poor the eternal truths of Mormonism and<br/>
cheer the honest hearted. Many learned and some very<br/>
noted men have embraced the work. I have been <br/>
enabled to subdue my foes many of the gifts of the Spirit<br/>
are manifest. One young man who had been deaf and<br/>
dumb 8 years was healed when coming up out of the waters<br/>
of baptism so he both heard and spake was ordained<br/>
to the Priesthood and is now preaching the Gospel with<br/>
success.""</p>

<p>Captain Dan Jones was adding<br/>
to the Churches in Wales 150 per mouth. Elder<br/>
[[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] also wrote to me many good things<br/>
He said in his letter to me:</p>

<p>""The work is rolling forth in<br/>
much power. I have been of late stiring up the</p>",
42658.0,343,,"<p>Saints to pay their tithing. I have visited many of the Conferences and feel<br/>
encouraged to believe I shall gather a good sum for the Temple.</p>

<p>The addition to the Churches continue to<br/>
be great. The migration falls much short of the increase. There<br/>
may be 1500 Saints emigranted this season but what is that among<br/>
so many</p>

<p>""The Saints wax very bold and utter their<br/>
testimony with much assurance in the Holy Ghost. It is truly<br/>
delightful to see them pushing sectarian churches and demolishing<br/>
human creeds as so much hay and stubble. The weak are<br/>
becoming strong and the Gentiles marvel.</p>

<p>""You would be astonished to see the issue of<br/>
books stars and tracts from the Star Office. Every fortnight<br/>
the issue of Stars has doubled since I took charge in '47 and<br/>
all other works in equal ration and the tide of truth rolls<br/>
irresistibily through the land.""</p>

<p>Some two weeks later [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Almon W. Babbit]]<br/>
called upon me and spent the evening and conversed upon a variety of<br/>
subjects. He had been to [[Washington|Washington]] and had spent a length of time<br/>
and called to see me to induce me to go there with him and get<br/>
an introduction to the members of Congress in case the Church should<br/>
wish me to do any business there another year. He said he had<br/>
been labouring while there to so arrange the Territorial bills<br/>
as to have a Territorial government in the Great Bason [[North America|North America]]<br/>
to be called the [[Utah Territory|Utah Territory]] embracing 300 miles in length<br/>
He thought it would be necessary for the inhabitants of [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Great Salt<br/>
Lake Valley]] to organize a State government &amp;c. He had got<br/>
a Post Office established at [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] and Elder [[Joseph Haywood|Haywood]]<br/>
appointed Post Master; also had got Post Offices established at<br/>
[[Garden Grove, Unorganized County, Iowa|Garden Grove]] &amp; [[Mount Pisgah, Union County, Iowa|Mount Pisgah]]. He was very familiar with the<br/>
members from [[Iowa|Iowa]] and [[Illinois|Illinois]] and [[Thomas Benton|Thomas Benton]] of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
came to him just before he left and shook hands with him familiarly<br/>
After hearing all Almon Babbit had to say I concluded that he</p>",
42658.0,344,1849-01-24,"<p>was at work upon [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|his]] own book and not by the Council of the<br/>
Presidency of the Church. So I resolved that my health calling and the<br/>
spirit within me would not permit me to leave the business upon<br/>
which I was sent and go to [[Washington|Washington]].</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",01/24/1849
42658.0,344,,""">24th</time> I received three letters from<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] and [[Dominicus Carter|Dominicas Carter]] from the<br/>
[[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Bluffs]] and two from the [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Valley]] one from [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A.O. Smoot]].</p>

<p>The letter from brother Smoot gave an<br/>
account of the affairs in the Valley since his arrival there. He<br/>
said the organization of the Presidency was received in the Valley<br/>
and all business attended to that was necessary and wrote of the<br/>
ravages of the crickets upon the crops &amp;c.</p>

<p>George A. Smith and E. T. Benson wrote<br/>
that they had organized 50 Branches of the Church at Council<br/>
Bluffs and all were doing well. Most of the brethren who<br/>
went into the army had returned to their families. They had<br/>
built a new [[Kanesville Tabernacle, Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Tabernacle]] in [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Pottawatomie County]]. Brother [[Howard Egan|Egan]]<br/>
and 12 others had arrived on the 7th of Dec with the latest news<br/>
from [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]]. They left on the 13th of October.<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] had arrived at the Valley on the 20 of Sept<br/>
and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] on the 24th. [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] had<br/>
been appointed President of the Stake and [[John Young Jr.|John Young]] and [[Erastus Snow|Erastus<br/>
Snow]] his councillors. Arrangements were being made for<br/>
inclosing an additional field of 1100 ^acres^; 860 men had taken shares<br/>
in it varying from 5 to 10 acres the smallest lots being near<br/>
the city to accomodate the mechanic. All the buildings of<br/>
the fort were to be moved on to city lots except the square<br/>
enclosed by the Pioneers. The Indians were friendly and<br/>
it was considered safe to settle on farms. A new city<br/>
had been laid out 10 miles North of the Temple Block and<br/>
another about 10 miles South. All the lots surveyed<br/>
had been taken up and an addition had been made running<br/>
to the mountains on the East side. The Pioneers claims</p>",
42658.0,345,,"<p>were to be respected. Elder [[Addison Pratt|Addison Pratt]] had arrived from the [[Sandwich Islands|Sanwich<br/>
Islands]]; a company of Saints that went to [[California|California]] on board the Brooklin<br/>
were <u>en route </u> for the Valley; [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]<br/>
were within three days drive of [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] when the express<br/>
left and Dr Richards was driving his own team.</p>

<p>Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] wrote that they had raised<br/>
squshes in the Valley from 63 to 84 lbs and turnips 8 1/2 lbs.</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]] made a vegitable dinner for<br/>
the Presidency when they arrived and in the bill of fare were<br/>
items: green corn green peas green beans cucumbers beets<br/>
parsnips carrots onions potatoes turnips squashes pumpkins<br/>
pies cabbage mush mellons water mellons cantelopes, corn<br/>
bread, wheat bread, corn stalk, molasses rost beef &amp;c.</p>

<p>[[Chief Walker|Walker]] the famous Utah Chief had<br/>
visited the Saints in the Valley with his band of rifflemen<br/>
He said he always wished to live in peace with our people.<br/>
He wanted his children to grow up with ours as brothers. His<br/>
people should not steal from our people: if they did we were to<br/>
let him know and he would punish them and stop it. The<br/>
brethren told him they did not want his men to steal from the<br/>
Californians for we were at peace with them. Walker replied<br/>
my men hate the Spaniards and will steal from them and<br/>
I cannot help it.</p>

<p>Brother [[Daniel Browett|Danial Browett]] Allen and Cox<br/>
were all killed by a band of diggers in the Californian mountains<br/>
as they were exploring a new pass through the mountains<br/>
They were surrounded when asleep and killed with stones. One<br/>
hundred dollars worth of gold dust was found on the ground belonging<br/>
to brother Allen. Their bodies were stripped of their clothes<br/>
and then buried by the Indians. This occured 40 miles<br/>
from the settlement on the [[Sacramento River, California|Sacramento]]. Their bodies were<br/>
found by a company who followed them. These brethren<br/>
I baptized in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] soon after I commenced preaching</p>",
42658.0,346,,"<p>at [[John Benbow|John Benbows]]. Brother [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] especially had been an earnest true<br/>
hearted Latter-day Saint and I know nothing to the contrary of the<br/>
others. They went into the army as soldiers in the Mormon Battalion<br/>
and have died as martyrs in their mission.</p>

<p>Brother [[Dominicus Carter|Carter]] wrote that during the<br/>
Conference in the Valley [[Lyman Wight|Lyman White]] had been retained in<br/>
his standing for they did not know that the Church had withdrawn<br/>
fellowship from him at the [[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Bluffs]] nor had received his pamplet.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of Feb I received 24 Nos<br/>
of the Millennial Star and from a letter written by [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley<br/>
P. Pratt]] August 1848 I gathered the following concerning<br/>
the prosperity of the Valley in the first year of our settlement:</p>

<p>""We are blessed in gardens in wheat and<br/>
corn and in all things I have set my hand unto. I have<br/>
raised some sixty bushels of good wheat without irrigation<br/>
a few bushels of rye and oats and my corn in the field<br/>
looks as well as any corn I ever saw in the States. The<br/>
wheat crop exceeds all expectation. Oats do better than in the<br/>
States say 60 bushels to one of the sowing in good ground. Every<br/>
kind of vegetables suited to the Northren latitudes does well<br/>
[[Levi Ward Hancock|Levi Hancock]] sowed seven pounds weight of [[California|California]] wheat<br/>
on the 14th of April and reaped 22 bushels the latter part of <br/>
July. He sowed half a bushel of common English wheat<br/>
on an acre and half and reaped upwards of twenty bushels<br/>
One grain of seven eared wheat produced seventy two ears<br/>
Barley that was sown ripened and was reaped and carried<br/>
off. The land then was irrigated and produced from the<br/>
roots a fresh crop four times the quantity of the first crop<br/>
Oats that were sown produced a good crop and cleared. The<br/>
roots again sprung up and produced another beautiful crop<br/>
Three crops of peas ripened on the same spot of ground and<br/>
the peas of the crop raised used for seed. Beet sead planted<br/>
this Spring produce beets as thick as a mans leg and go to</p>",
42658.0,347,1849-02-04,"<p>seed and yield a large quantity. Cabage seed planted this Spring produces<br/>
seed again.""</p>

<p>Sunday the <time datetime=""",02/04/1849

of the day with my family My [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children come together once<br/>
a week. We sang and prayed and then I taught them the things<br/>
of the Kingdom of God; after which I was accustomed to break bread with<br/>
and partake of the Sacrament with them.</p>

<p>On this Sabbath my only son being nine<br/>
years of age and a good youth and under the influence of the Spirit<br/>
of God I ordained him to the office of Priest to officiate in that<br/>
office in his father's household until he arrived at suitable age to<br/>
officiate in the Church</p>

<p>My wife Phebe when I was away from my<br/>
family attending to the affairs of the Church would call my children<br/>
together and teach and instruct them to pray and to understand the<br/>
principles of faith and the Gospel and now my son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]]<br/>
could administer the sacrament to my family when debared<br/>
the privilege of attending meeting at a Branch of the Church.</p>

<p>I met with the [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] Branch of the<br/>
Church and as Bro [[Alexander Badlam|Badlam]] the Presiding Elder had left for<br/>
[[California|California]] I thought it wisdom to appoint another and so<br/>
I appointed Elder [[Stephen H. Pierce|Stephen H Pierce]].</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",02/15/1849
42658.0,347,,""">15th of February</time> I wrote a letter<br/>

<p><time datetime=""",03/01/1849
42658.0,348,,""">March the 1st</time> of this year I was 42<br/>
years of age. The following is an extract from a letter written<br/>
by me this day to [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]]:</p>

<p>[[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] March 1st 1849</p>

<p>Elder Pratt:</p>

<p>Beloved Brother,</p>

<p>As this is my birthday also the first<br/>
day of Spring my mind is led more than usual this morning<br/>
to reflect upon the signs of the times and while meditating upon<br/>
Zion and her swift Messengers my mind flies across the<br/>
ocean to a large company of them who are the ""horns"" of [[Joseph (OT)|Joseph]]<br/>
to push the people together from the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>These meditations create a desire to<br/>
converse a few moments with Brother Pratt. So while all<br/>
nature is locked fast in sleep before the dawn of day which awakes<br/>
man from his slumber I seat myself to say a few words<br/>
to you.</p>

<p>I said this was my birthday. Yes I<br/>
am 42 years old this day. How such figures look to a<br/>
man while counting up his years in this probation. The<br/>
very sight of them crowd into ^ones^ mind a flood of thought even<br/>
more than tongue can utter or pen can write. The<br/>
last sixteen years of my life has been spent in endeavouring</p>",
42658.0,349,,"<p>to preach the Gospel and build up the kingdom of God in connection with<br/>
my brethren.</p>

<p>The past is gone. I have no desire to recall<br/>
it. I would not wish to live my life over again if I could. I <br/>
feel like looking forward and not backward. I have a great desire<br/>
that I may spend my future days doing the works of righteousness<br/>
honouring the Priesthood and my calling saving the souls of men and<br/>
building up the Kingdom of God that I may have a place with the<br/>
faithful at the end of the race.</p>

<p>Turn my eyes which way I will either towards<br/>
[[Babylon|Babylon]] or Zion and I find the movements and signs of both fully<br/>
keeping pace with the wheels of time.</p>

<p>It is deeply interesting to see hear feel and<br/>
live in this age and gaze upon the scenery of the whole earth<br/>
which is rushing like a mighty cataract to finish its work.</p>

<p>While the Jews were highminded and in<br/>
the light of their pride the Son of God in Lamb like meekness<br/>
bowed to the ordinance of baptism and all the rites of the Gospel<br/>
and commandments of his father looking forward to the day when<br/>
he should make his second visit to his brethren with his reward upon<br/>
his head. So at the present day while Emperors Kings Princes<br/>
Lords Nobles Presidents and the great men of Babylon have<br/>
been making a desperate effort to maintain their dignity and<br/>
appear to good advantage before the whole earth many of the<br/>
noblest spirits that ever dwelt in flesh like Jesus and the Apostles<br/>
have been meekly submitting to the ordinances of the Gospel<br/>
and like little children been subject to the authority of the Holy<br/>
Priesthood. They have made every sacrifice required and<br/>
laboured day and night to build up Zion that the honest in<br/>
heart and meek of the earth may have a place to flee to<br/>
in order to escape the just judgement of that God whose rod<br/>
is now suspended in the heavens and about to fall upon the<br/>
earth and lay Great Babylon with all her greatness pomp</p>",
42658.0,350,1849-03-04,"<p>power and glory in the dust.</p>

<p>My prayer to God is that every Elder of [[Israel|Israel]]<br/>
and Saint of God throughout the whole earth may be encouraged to<br/>
labour dilligently and faithfully while the day of harvest lasts<br/>
for soon night will come when no man can work: then they<br/>
will be just as sure of their reward as was their chief<br/>
captain and Head.</p>

<p>Sunday the <time datetime=""",03/04/1849
42658.0,350,1849-03-13,""">4th</time> I met a congregation<br/>
of Saints and Strangers at brother [[Edmund Fuller Bird|Birds]] at 2 o'clock. Elder<br/>
[[Edson Whipple|Whipple]] from the [[Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] was present and Elder [[Jesse Haven|Jesse<br/>
P. Haven]] from the Bluffs. We had a full house and<br/>
myself and the newly arrived brethren addressed the people<br/>
After which I administered the sacrament and confirmed<br/>
two persons and blessed three children.</p>

<p>A curious circumstance took place<br/>
in the history of the Presidents of the United States this year<br/>
President [[James Knox Polk|Polk]] went out of office <strike>of</strike> on Saturday the 3rd of March<br/>

carriage broke down but I reached Brother [[Nathanial Eldridge|Nathaniel Eldridge's]] house<br/>

<p>Next day was Sunday. I met with a large<br/>
congregation of the inhabitants of the Cape Saints Captains sailors fishermen<br/>
Christian and infidels and preached in the forenoon afternoon and<br/>
evening and then held a church meeting until midnight. I organized<br/>
a church here with 21 members and appointed Nathaniel Eldridge<br/>
Presiding Elder and [[Horace Humphry|Horace Humphry]] and [[Thomas F. Eldredge|Thomas T. Eldridge]] his<br/>
councillors. I baptized and confirmed one &amp; administered unto<br/>

<p>When [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] sen. the First Patriarch of the Church<br/>
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints laid his hands upon my<br/>
head to give me my Patriarchal blessing he said I should<br/>
have my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] household standing with me in the<br/>
covenant of the Gospel and that I should have power to bring<br/>
them into the Kingdom. I afterwards visited my father's<br/>
household preached to them the Gospel and baptized my father<br/>
^[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]]^ [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] and every member of my father's household and several<br/>
other relatives. My wife also whose maiden name<br/>
was [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Carter]] received a promise that she should<br/>
have her father and his household in the new and everlasting</p>",

sisters were in the church her two brothers were now also very<br/>
friendly though her brother [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra]] had been much opposed till recently<br/>
and this day her father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Ezra Carter]] Sen. was baptized and<br/>
became a member of the Church. I walked through the<br/>
city of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] with my father-in-law and his grandson<br/>
[[Calvin Ichabod Foss|Calvin Foss]] who was going to [[California|California]] in the ship<br/>
Arealus which we visited; and after visiting many parts<br/>
of Boston we returned home and held a meeting at my <br/>
hired house<strike> which I hired</strike>.</p>

<p>I opened our family meeting by prayer Bro<br/>
[[Jesse Carter Little|Jesse C. Little]] then addressed us and [[William Page|William Page]] spoke and<br/>
then I arose and addressed my friends for an hour in much<br/>
plainness and in the expression of my feelings.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting I led my<br/>
father-in-law Ezra Carter Sen. with two others down into the<br/>
sea and baptized them. Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] accompanied her father<br/>
to the water and back again and we both felt to rejoice that<br/>
the words of the old Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] were fulfilled upon<br/>
our heads.</p>

<p>Father Ezra Carter was 76 years and three<br/>
days old at the time that I baptized him. He was the son<br/>
of [[Ezra Carter, b. 1739|Ezra Carter]] 84 years of age when he died, who was the son<br/>
of [[Daniel Carter, b. 1719|Daniel Carter]] who was the son of [[Ephraim Carter|Ezekiel Carter]]. The<br/>
mother of my wife's father bore the maiden name of [[Phoebe Whittemore Carter, b. 1735|Phebe<br/>

William Page myself and Mrs Woodruff visited [[Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Mount Auburn]]<br/>
which is considered one of the most interesting cemetry's in<br/>
the world. We next visited [[Bunker Hill Monument, Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Bunker Hill Monument]] and<br/>
Father Carter though 76 years old walked to the top of that<br/>

a mile wide. Brother Russell had owned the whole <br/>
of the Island for eleven years during which time he had<br/>
built 23 ships upon it with an average tonage of 650<br/>
tons each. His location land and improvements <br/>
were at a low rate worth $30,000 besides 3 ships on hand. He was <br/>
calculating to sell on the 5th of Nov at some price or other settle <br/>
his business and go to the Valley.</p>

<p>The Island was a very beautiful and <br/>
plesant situation a good location for ship building in the centre <br/>
of the river which abounds with salmon mackeral herring chad<br/>
and other fish in their season</p>

this Sunday morning and was much edified with his teachings and <br/>
pleased with the order carried out in his meetings and family circle<br/>
and in his temporal business. I met with them in the afternoon<br/>
and spoke to them from [[Amos (OT)|Amos]]: ""Surely the Lord God will do nothing <br/>
but he revealeth his secrets to his servants the Prophets.""</p>

<p>Next evening I visited the burying ground<br/>
of Bro [[Joseph Russell|Russell's]] family were laid 4 of his children who had been <br/>
taken from the various places where they had been buried and <br/>
laid together upon this Island. [[Thomas Russell|One]] of them was a young man who <br/>
held the office of Priest in the Church and died strong in the faith.</p>

<p>The burying ground was surrounded by <br/>
a cluster of tall Pine trees and a wall of solid mason work 12 <br/>
feet square and 7 feet high with a cope stone enclosed the <br/>
spot where the bodies laid.</p>

<p>I received a letter from brother [[Jacob Gibson|Gibson]]<br/>
giving news of the Epistle of the Twelve and that the quorum of <br/>
the Twelve Apostles of the Church was filled up with [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D Richards]]<br/>

spoke of the signs of the times; then returned with Elder [[Joseph Russell|Russel]] to Bro <br/>
Wm. Maxfield's There was also 4 Saints in [[Charlottetown, Queens County, Prince Edward Island, British North America|Charlottetown]].</p>

farming country to appearance but with all this the people were <br/>
nearly in a state of starvation the crops having failed for two years <br/>

All the colonies seemed to be in a deplorable state, hundreds of <br/>
miles of the country had been burned over this year with fire, sweeping <br/>
millions of acres of forest farms fences barns dwellings mills<br/>
lumber and lumber yards and in some cases the inhabitants had <br/>
to flee into the sea or on the beach to escape the flames. Every <br/>

Received From the First Presidency</p>

<p>[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]]</p>

<p>July 25, 1849.</p>

<p>Dear Brother Woodruff,</p>

<p>As our mail is now making up for the <br/>
States we cannot let so favourable an opportunity of communicating <br/>
with you pass unimproved.</p>

<p>Our prospects for grain are tolerably good and <br/>
if we are not flooded with immigration intending for the mines <br/>
but compelled to tarry here we should have plenty for the <br/>
ensuing year. Out wheat harvest is now at its height and <br/>
is coming off for better than appearance seemed to warrant <br/>
The spirit of industry which has ever characterized the Saints</p>",
42658.0,367,,"<p>of the Most High God has been brought to bear with wonderful effect upon <br/>
the burning and arid desert.</p>

<p>The next time that you encounter the hardships <br/>
privations and toil of a journey over the plains and mountains you <br/>
will meet with a very different reception from what attended your<br/>
first arrival here. Friends will greet your arrival and the products<br/>
of the earth will administer to your comfort.</p>

<p>Our city and [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Valley]] is fast improving <br/>
roads are being made and bridges mills and houses building on every <br/>
side with astonishing rapidity considering our circumstances and <br/>
the disadvantages under which we labour but the blessings <br/>
of health peace and union have attended us. Hence our prosperity.</p>

<p>We have a settlement in the [[Utah Valley, Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah Valley]] <br/>
and have extended North above the [[Weber River, Utah Territory|Weber river]]. We have <br/>
irrigated our land which is considerable labour but ^it^ will <strike>dimith</strike><br/>
diminish as we improve in fixtures and experience. One <br/>
thing is certain. All the necessary products of the earth <br/>
for the sustinance of man can be raised. You have <br/>
probably learned before this that we are endeavoring to <br/>
obtain a legal government from the United States. <br/>
Dr [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] is East upon this business and brother [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|A W<br/>
Babbitt]] will leave to morrow as our delegate to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]].</p>

<p>Our object is to gain admission as<br/>
a Sovereign State into the Union. Whenever you can use <br/>
your influence to further this object do so. Also gather up <br/>
and come on with all you can bring another season. We shall <br/>
be quite happy to see you as will all your friends.</p>

<p>We had yesterday a celebration of the <br/>
anniversary of the arrival of the Pioneers in this Valley. It was a day <br/>
long to be remembered. Your [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] enjoyed it well being one of the 24 <br/>
aged fathers selected as part of the escort. For full details of these <br/>
proceedings see the Frontier Guardian. Wishing for the peace of heaven to rest upon you </p>",

as a Lamb to the slaughter yet I shall die with a conscience <br/>
void of offence towards God and man. I feel as calm as <br/>
a Summer's morning"" and the expression of his countenance<br/>
showed that he was so. He added ""It will yet be said <br/>

There are certain events which stand forth in bold relief of deep <br/>
interest in the history of every nation under heaven. Therefore the <br/>
history of the Indians or their present condition has also a <br/>
deep interest — an interest of greater importance than at first <br/>
presents itself to the mind of the American people. Although <br/>
it may appear to them as covered with a cloud or buried <br/>
deep from their view yet it non the less exists</p>

<p>Then listen to me: I have deeply</p>",
42658.0,373,,"<p>studied the situtaiton and interest of of my brethren the Red Men for years and I <br/>
have resolved to call ^aloud^ upon the white man of this nation to give ear to my <br/>
petitions.</p>

<p>If you do not see the Indian Orator in your midst <br/>
making a display of oratory like the white man it is not because he <br/>
has not talent but because he has not the chance to exercise it.</p>

<p>1st: My object in visiting the United States is <br/>
to present a petition to this government that they may assist me in <br/>
concentrating the Indians together that they may live and not die. I <br/>
want Congress to grant them a portion of Territory that they can <br/>
call their own and be concentrated upon it that they may not be <br/>
driven from it any more. They once were the owners and occupiers <br/>
of the whole soil of all [[North America|North America]]. The white man came<br/>
and removed the Indians and continually have driven them until <br/>
they can see no hope but the grave before them.</p>

<p>I now ask in their behalf a territory to <br/>
settle them upon that they may have a permanent home forever <br/>
and come under the United States Government and become part <br/>
and parcel of the United States. In this matter I have studied <br/>
the <strike>history</strike>^interest^ of all both the white and the red man.</p>

<p>1st: give them a Territory that they can <br/>
call their own where their children can point to the graves of the <br/>
fathers and say, We can now live in peace and be driven <br/>
no more; we can visit the graces of our fathers with none to <br/>
drive us from them; and they will be inspired to engage in every <br/>
laudable untertaking that now marks the course of the white <br/>
man.</p>

<p>2nd You can then establish schools among <br/>
them that will be of benefit to them. They would obtain <br/>
knowledge and make a good use of it. The Gospel could <br/>
then be introduced among them and they would be far more <br/>
ready to receive it when they find the white man is consistant <br/>
and willing to do them good; but when the white man </p>",
42658.0,374,,"<p>offers the Gospel to the Indians one year and the next comes and drives <br/>
him from his home and the graces of his fathers he has no faith or <br/>
confidence in either the white man or his Gospel.</p>

<p>3rd you can then introduce agriculture amongst <br/>
them and they will receive it for they would then see of necessity they <br/>
must cultivate the land or dies. They could not depend upon game <br/>
for support and they would turn their attention to cultivating <br/>
the soil make improvements and take delight in them the <br/>
same as the white man.</p>

<p>4th They would then be in a position <br/>
where they would be delivered from the ill consequences of <br/>
constant removing which has continually followed them for <br/>
many years. The ill consequences of removing have <br/>
been multiplied and very great. This has been on main <br/>
reason why schools have been unproductive of good among <br/>
them. This is also the reason why missionaries have <br/>
done no more more good among them.</p>

<p>The Indians are fast decreasing and <br/>
passing away. That is the cause of all this. There are <br/>
various causes. There constant removing is one cause<br/>
Disease which has been introduced among them by the white <br/>
man in the capacity of traders missionaries and emigrants also <br/>
also the introduction of alcohol have had a tendency to waste <br/>
them away; also wars among themselves and wars with <br/>
the white man all of which have continually wasted away <br/>
the Indian tribes.</p>

<p>I will here remark that in the <br/>
origin of the wars with the whites the conducting of those <br/>
wars and in the treaties of peace made and broken the Indians<br/>
have been badly treated and abused by the whites</p>

<p>For instance some ruffian or tracker <br/>
visits the Indians introduces wild fire or alcohol among <br/>
them and will get the Indian drunk and perhaps drunk</p>",
42658.0,375,,"<p>himself and will cheat them in any way he can and perhaps kill some <br/>
of them and in his career he gets killed himself. Then the cry goes forth <br/>
that the savage Indians are killing and murdering the inhabitants of <br/>
the country. It is proclaimed in all the public journals of the <br/>
Union. Yes one side of the story is proclaimed as with peals <br/>
of thunder throughout the earth; but no voice is raised in behalf <br/>
of the poor Indian. Their story is not told. The world hear <br/>
it not; they do not enquire or ask for it. But as soon as the <br/>
story of the white man is known and proclaimed to the world the <br/>
armies of war must be prepared and soldiers sent forth to drive <br/>
and kill the Indians and burn their homes and in this way the most <br/>
desolating and expensive wars have been carried on for many <br/>
years until we feel it is time for the white man to take a<br/>
different course with the Indians,</p>

<p>As an example of the bad effects of <br/>
continually removing the Indians I would refer you to the [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee <br/>
nation]]. That people were fast improving following rapidly <br/>
in the footsteps of the white man had extensive farms and <br/>
good dwellings and continued rapidly advancing in improvements <br/>
until they were suddenly brought to a stand in their course by <br/>
being cruelly called upon by the State of [[Georgia|Georgia]] to give up their <br/>
lands and go away from the graves of their fathers into the <br/>
wilderness. And thus it was that thir mighty nation instead <br/>
of receiving that support ^encouragement^ and comfort from the nation that it ought <br/>
to receive was forced by the cruel hand of oppression to bow <br/>
^out see copy^ their heads in sorrow ^and despair^ until they shall be called to pass through <br/>
the same ordeal again to remove and remove until they are <br/>
anihilated from off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Oh Ye white man what encouragement <br/>
do you give the Indian to plant to build to learn to cultivate <br/>
the earth or receive a religion that professes love mercy <br/>
kindness and truth while those who profess to enjoy <br/>
it deals out such deeds of oppression and cruelty upon the </p>",
42658.0,376,,"<p>heads of the red <strike>man</strike>^men^ that it drives them to madness and despair.</p>

<p>Let the American nation stay their hands <br/>
from this time forth in their oppression and driving of the Indians lest <br/>
they drive them beyond a point which the Indian will endure and <br/>
return a blow upon the head of the white man which will fill many <br/>
a habitation with death.</p>

<p>Once give the Indians a Territory—a <br/>
home where they can have a full assurance that their ears or those <br/>
of their children will no more be saluted with a call to remove from <br/>
their lands then if if they do not show forth a spirit of improvement <br/>
then cast them off as not worthy of your support or attention but <br/>
until then you are not justified your garments are not clear.</p>

<p>The spirit of the age and times <br/>
demands that Congress should take immediate action upon this <br/>
matter. 1st: The Indians cannot retain their lands.<br/>
Emigration of the white men are already surrounding<br/>
them and in their midst and the richness and fertility <br/>
of the Indian<strike>s</strike> lands are a temptation to the white <br/>
man and invite him to settle thereon.</p>

<p>2nd the Indians have too much <br/>
land more than what they need to till and cultivate <br/>
for their support.</p>

<p>Let there be a Territory set off <br/>
on the North West of [[Iowa|Iowa]] North of [[Miller|Council Bluffs]]<br/>
on the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri]] on which there is no no white <br/>
settlement and let the Indians East of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky<br/>
Mountains]] and in the United States be gathered <br/>
up in it. Then let other Territories in the West be appropriated <br/>
and let all the Indians on the [[North America|North American Continent]] be <br/>
collected together and learn <strike>us</strike> to cultivate the earth. They will <br/>
soon associate themselves together and cease their wars among <br/>
themselves also with the white men. If there is not something <br/>
of this kind done the vast emigration through all the Indian </p>",
42658.0,377,,"<p>lands will soon destroy the game and then want and starvation will ensue and <br/>
this will bring on war between the white and red men.</p>

<p>If my proposition is accepted by the American <br/>
Government and they will carry it out it will be of vast benifit both <br/>
to the Indians and the people of the United States.</p>

<p>1st the benefit to the Indians will be: It will give <br/>
them a permanent home where schools can be established among them <br/>
and their children taught the English language. Farms can also be opened <br/>
among them and when they see they have a permanent home <br/>
for themselves and their children and they have no game to <br/>
depend upon for food they will immediately <strike>immediately</strike> go to <br/>
work and cultivate the earth like ^the^ white man. The Gospel <br/>
can then be introduced among them to a good effect and they will <br/>
receive it with thankfulness when they can be made to believe <br/>
that the hand that deals out the Gospel to them is not laying a <br/>
plan to take the advantage of them and preparing a way <br/>
to drive them from their home and country. It will not only <br/>
unite their intrest and attachment towards each other but <br/>
their regard and interest with that of the United States.</p>

<p>The benefit to the Government is less <br/>
expenses:</p>

<p>1st buying their lands and paying them yearly <br/>
annuities which is costing the government immense sums of <br/>
money.</p>

<p>2nd: The continual transporting of Indians <br/>
from place to place. There has laready been 96,000 Indians<br/>
removed by the Government.</p>

<p>3rd: The keeping of many Indian Agents <br/>
at great expence to Government could then be dispensed with.</p>

<p>4th: Fortifications have now to be <br/>
errected on the borders of all Indian tribes with the intention <br/>
of keeping the Indians in Subjection. These would not be <br/>
needed if the Indians were in a Territory of their own for </p>",
42658.0,378,,"<p>by having this trail clear and no encroachments of the white man upon <br/>
their borders there would be no cause of war or fortifications.</p>

<p>I am going to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] soom to lay my petition <br/>
before the Congress of the United States and urge them to grant my <br/>
prayer for the benefit of both the white and red man.</p>

<p>I want your aid: I want you to sign <br/>
my petition that the voice of thousands may be heard in behalf <br/>
of this petition. I want the names of legislators governors <br/>
and American Citizens in general that my prayer may be <br/>
heard and answered.</p>

<p>Give the North American Indians <br/>
a home a place where the soles of their feet can rest in peace <br/>
in a situation where you can teach them literature agriculture <br/>
and commerce and give them the chance the white man has <br/>
and I prophesy in the name of the Lord that there will <br/>
ere long be found among them their philosophers their <br/>
[[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]s and [[George Washington|Washington]]s who would do honour to <br/>
any civilized or Christian nation on the globe. But <br/>
let this nation turn a deef ear to my petitions and the <br/>
petitions of the Indians—continue to oppress them and <br/>
drive them to desperation and the hour is near when the Camp<br/>
fire will be seen upon many a hill. The war hoop will<br/>
re-echo from one end of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]] to the other. The <br/>
Indian will then sell his life as dear as possible and deal <br/>
out death whereever an opportunity offers. When this <br/>
blow is struck it will be terrible to all. May God <br/>
forbid that such a blow should fall at all that the <br/>
scenes of <strike>bloody</strike> Bloody Brook should <strike>ever</strike> ^any^ more be <br/>
enacted.</p>

<p>American citizens it is to ward <br/>
off this blow that I now stand before you—that I <br/>
now call upon this nation hearing a petition unto them</p>",
42658.0,379,,"<p>Among other remarks he said ""I applied<br/>
according to the wish of President [[Brigham Young|Young]] for a Territorial <br/>
Government. I had my last sad and painful interview <br/>
with President [[James Knox Polk|Polk]]. I found he did not feel to favour <br/>
your people and had his men of his own stamp picked <br/>
out to serve as Governor and other officers who would <br/>
have oppressed you in any way to fill their own pockets<br/>
He would not appoint men from among yourselves <br/>
and I saw it absolutely necessary that you should <br/>
have officers of your own people to govern you or <br/>
you were better without any government. I had <br/>
to use my own discretion and I withdrew the petition.</p>

<p>We arrived at [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis Missouri]]<br/>
and I was soon visited by Elders [[Joseph Leland Heywood|Heywood]] and [[Nathaniel Henry Felt|Felt]].</p>

<p>I made a contract with Captain<br/>
Baker to take up our company on the Sacramento<br/>
to [[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Council Bluffs]] on the following terms. Cabin $13<br/>
deck $4 freight 50 cts per 100 lbs.</p>

<p>The Sacramento came alongside <br/>
the Clinton and took our freight on board which occupied <br/>
most of the day.</p>

<p>I felt thankful to God that we had <br/>
arrived at St Louis in safety and no lives lost and <br/>
up to this time we had no deaths among us but this <br/>
night Sister [[Margaret Montgomery Bird|Bird]] was taken sick with cholera and the <br/>
next <strike>day</strike>^morning^ she died.</p>",
42658.0,386,1850-05-06,"<p>We called upon the city authorities to bury [[Margaret Montgomery Bird|her]]<br/>
and the Sexton soon came with a coffin and we paid the last respects<br/>
to the remains of our sister.</p>

<p>After a hard days work to get our company <br/>
and boat ready we started at dark but brothers [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]] <br/>
and [[Joseph Russell|Russel]] were left on shore they however afterwards came <br/>
down and the Captain took them in.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",05/06/1850
42658.0,386,1850-05-12,""">6th</time> we stoped about 2 hours at <br/>
[[Bloomfield, Stoddard County, Missouri|Bloomfield]] and brother [[William Henry Branch| Branch]] went to the grave yard and <br/>
buried his child that had died of the worm fever<br/>
News met us on our way up the river<br/>
that many were coming back from the Plains and selling <br/>
out their teams and going home and so the price of oxen <br/>
was falling. They had made a rush to the mines <br/>
before any grass had grown to sustain their oxen.</p>

<p>We started for [[St. Joseph, Buchanan County, Missouri|St Joseph's]] on the <br/>
<time datetime=""",05/12/1850
42658.0,386,1850-05-14,""">12th of May</time> and early on the morning of the <time datetime=""",05/14/1850
42658.0,386,1850-05-15,""">14th</time> word <br/>
was given for the passengers to walk on shore to lighten<br/>
the boat and some of our company with mules left for<br/>
the [[Council Bluffs, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Bluffs]] and when we got ready they could not be found<br/>
It was supposed they had fainted by the way and our <br/>
Captain and others rode miles in search of them but came<br/>
back without finding them and then we started up the <br/>
river with our boat and came upon them about 5 miles<br/>
a head.</p>

<p>We arrived at [[Fort Kearny, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Kearney]] on the <br/>
morning of the <time datetime=""",05/15/1850
42658.0,386,,""">15th</time> and left all the passengers and freight<br/>
not bound for the Bluffs and went on to [[Bethlehem, Unorganized County, Iowa|Deseret Depot]] <br/>
where we arrived about dark. Here I found my brother<br/>
in law [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] Brother [[Alexander Badlam|Badlam]] and many others. I <br/>
spent most of the night on my feet taking charge<br/>
of our baggage.</p>

<p>Next day I reached [[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Kanesville]]</p>",
42658.0,387,1850-05-18,"<p>had a little time with Elder [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] and then returned to my company <br/>
which I had left to visit in [[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Kanesville]].</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",05/18/1850
42658.0,387,,""">18th</time> I again rode to Kanesville<br/>
with Elder [[Alexander Badlam|Badlam]] and [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]] spent a little time with <br/>
him and then went to Elder Hyde's where I found him and [[Orson Pratt|Orson <br/>
Pratt]].</p>

<p>I spent a long evening in conversation with <br/>
these brethren of the Twelve. Elder Hyde wished me to lay <br/>
before the Presidency in the [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Valley]] the affairs of the Church <br/>
in [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Pottawatamie County Iowa]]. He wished me to say <br/>
to them that all the men of capital were leaving for the <br/>
Valley; men from the East and [[England|England]] and all who<br/>
were able to go were making their fit out and talking of <br/>
starting.</p>

<p>There was another class he said who were <br/>
able to get a fit out in part even able to get waggons and <br/>
they were helped on by Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] so that the poorest<br/>
part of the community alone remained.</p>

<p>He did not think Kanesville and the <br/>
surrounding country should be broken up which would be the <br/>
case if it continued thus and wished me to lay the subject<br/>
before the Presidency with many more details that he gave<br/>
me of his views.</p>

<p>Elder Orson Pratt wished me to say to <br/>
the Presidnecy that there were many Elders in England of <br/>
power faith and talent who had to labour hard to get bread<br/>
for their famili<strike>s</strike>es and when Elders were sent to them from <br/>
America who could not edify them they felt it a tax upon <br/>
them and that their own Elders were more efficient in the <br/>
ministry than some of those sent unto them.</p>

<p>On the next day according to appointment<br/>
I met in Conference with Orson Hyde Orson Pratt and the <br/>
High Council near the Stand in the Grove one hour</p>",
42658.0,388,,"<p>before the General meeting.  Elder [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] addressed the Conference <br/>
in Substance as follows:</p>

<p>There was business left unfisnished at <br/>
the Conference which must be closed today. As some of <br/>
the officers were going to the Valley others must be appointed<br/>
Bishop [[Aaron Johnson|Johson]] wsa going and another Bishop must be <br/>
appointed in his place also men to visit the various<br/>
Branches who would attend the Council and carry the <br/>
Spirit of the Council to the people and bring back their <br/>
spirit to them. [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] and [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin <br/>
Clapp]] who were appointed last year were not with them <br/>
at all either in body or, spirit and whenever they did <br/>
attend a Council Joseph Young could not stay until <br/>
he went away. We will let that pass over we will <br/>
let them go.</p>

<p>Elder Hyde also remarked that it was <br/>
necessary to make arrangements to receive the poor<br/>
that had of late arrived among us. I have given <br/>
Counsel through the Guardian for the poor not to <br/>
come here and some have contrary to this counsel<br/>
through misguided zeal counselling them to come and <br/>
such must hear the consequences of it.</p>

<p>It was afterwards voted that <br/>
a Bishop be appointed to take the place of Bishop Johnson<br/>
and that Elder [[Lyman Stoddard|Stoddard]] be appointed to travel among<br/>
the Churches and call such men to his aid as he needed. Three men were appointed as committe<br/>
to locate the poor.</p>

<p>We then repaired to the Stand<br/>
before the congregation and each item of business<br/>
was presented to the people and Elder Hyde made<br/>
many remarks upon each item as it came along<br/>
and gave counsel to the people.</p>",
42658.0,389,1850-06-01,"<p>In the afternoon Elder [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] preached and related the <br/>
progress of the work in [[England|England]] of the thousands who were coming into <br/>
the Church the publications from the Millennial Star office and the <br/>
opposition manifesting. He was followed by Elder Woodruff.</p>

<p>The speaker said he had baptized while on this <br/>
mission about 200 souls. As to the poor coming to [[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Hanesville]]<br/>
he had received counsel from the First Presidency to streach out his <br/>
arms and gather all he possible could to Zion and when the <br/>
Lord told him to do anything or he received counsel through the <br/>
proper source he went at it with all his might. He<br/>
had laboured hard to gather out the people according to the <br/>
instruction given him. One company started from [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]<br/>
under Elder [[Jacob Gibson|Gibson]] and he himself had started from [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] <br/>
on the 9th instant with a company of 209 which was <br/>
increased at [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis]] to 225. There <strike>are</strike>^were^ a few<br/>
poor who had come with him who were not able to go <br/>
through and if in his zeal to carry out the instruction <br/>
of the Presidency he had been instrumental in causing more<br/>
of the poor to come to Kanseville than ought to have come<br/>
it was an error of the head not of the heart.</p>

<p>In outfitting the brethren paid from $45 to $80 per yoke for oxen.</p>

for [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]].</p>

<p>After the usual preparation and<br/>

<p>Remarks were made by Wilford Woodruff con<strike>c</strike>serning the <br/>
order of the camp and regulations for our journey strongly <br/>
opposing drinking swearing gambling whipping oxen &amp;c.</p>

<p>[[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus F. Carter]] had ten waggons of <br/>
merchandise and was appointed Captain over them but <br/>
in consequence of ^illness and^ the lateness of the season he concluded to <br/>
return home so we made out the report of our organization <br/>
and sent it by him to Elder [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]].</p>

<p>My brother in law [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus F Carter]] <br/>
left in my possession his train of merchandise which <br/>
with my own gave me 12 waggons 27 yoke of oxen 30<br/>
cows teamsters &amp;c under my personal care besides <br/>
the whole company to care for generally and this afforded<br/>
plenty of labour and anxiety. Several of the teamsters<br/>
were also not breth<strike>e</strike>ren and they were more difficult to <br/>
manage and during the journey they manifested much of <br/>
the Spirit of the devil and tried to make disturbance<br/>
in the Camp. They were gold diggers. Their object was </p>",
42658.0,391,1850-06-28,"<p>to take advantage of ^our^ situation and compel us to pay higher wages<br/>
I told them they might leave and discharged their ringleader<br/>
and the rest became more humble; but finally we had to cast them out.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",07/30/1850
42658.0,391,,""">30th</time> of July the 1st division of our camp<br/>
was called to pass through one of those scenes so much <br/>
dreaded by all emigrant companies—namely, a stampede.</p>

<p>^of all^ <strike>All</strike> the oxen with the families<br/>
and waggons of the first division with the exception</p>",
42658.0,392,,"<p>of the ten baggage waggons which were in the rear <strike>s</strike>.</p>

<p>No person who has not witnessed one of these <br/>
terrific scenes can form any correct idea of them and it is almost<br/>
impossible to give an adequate description of it.</p>

<p>Behold 30 or 40 ox teams with from <br/>
2 to 5 yoke of cattle in each team attached to a family waggon <br/>
of goods women and children all in an instant like the twinkling <br/>
of an eye become frantic all dart off with lightning speed <br/>
running their own way bellowing rolling and tumbling over <br/>
each others waggons upsetting smashing their wheels axes and <br/>
tongues ^spilling^ <strike>upsetting</strike> the goods women and children for the next <br/>
teams to trample under feet as they roar and charge along <br/>
with their yokes bows and chains flying in every direction. <br/>
Such is a Stampede and the scene is not easily immagined<br/>
nor described.</p>

<p>Our Stamped commenced in the <br/>
following manner:</p>

<p>While my son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]] was getting on <br/>
to his horse [[William Murphy|William Murphy]] ^struck the horse horse with a whip and^ started ^his^ <strike>his horse</strike> into a <br/>
run and Wilford's <sup>horse</sup> ^was^ flung <sup>him</sup> over his head onto <br/>
the ground the saddle ^was turned^ under <strike>his</strike> ^the horses^ belley and he ran away <br/>
and as he approached one of the waggons Mr [[Marsena Cannon|Cannon]]'s <br/>
team became frantic and started off with great spead <br/>
In a moment 20 or 30 teams followed the example and<br/>
the whole encampment apparantly was rushing into the <br/>
jaws of Death.</p>

<p>I was by my carriage when this <br/>
commenced. In my carriage which was drawn by a <br/>
fine black steed were [[Rhoda Harriet Foss Richards|Rhoda Foss]] and [[Susan Cornelia Woodruff Scholes|Susan Woodruff]] <br/>
and we were at the head of the company.</p>

<p>I saw Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] rush into the <br/>
midst of the scene when she was in danger of her life every <br/>
instant with many other women and children. I told</p>",
42658.0,393,,"<p>[[Rhoda Harriet Foss Richards|Rhoda]] to let my horse run into the Bluffs and to do the best she could<br/>
and then I gave him a cut to start him into a run and left them <br/>
to their chance and the care of Providence and rushed into the <br/>
midst of the Stampede to try to save the life of my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and<br/>
as  many others as possible but I had hard work to save my <br/>
own life.</p>

<p>Mrs Woodruff soon found an opening<br/>
and fled out of the midst of the scene. Brother [[Robert C. Petty|Petty]]'s two <br/>
waggons were turned over. My family waggon with 4 <br/>
yoke of oxen ran over one of his and a waggon ran over <br/>
[[John Petty|one]] of his children ^+(out)^ [[Samuel Prescott Hardy|Prescott Hardy]] was knocked down <br/>
by his own team and badly wounded in the thigh and arm <br/>
Wherever I saw women or children in danger I did what<br/>
I could to rescue them but only little can be done at such<br/>
times except for each to dodge the best he can and save <br/>
his or her life if possible.</p>

<p>When I found I could do no more for <br/>
the encampment in general I ran forward to see what <br/>
state my carriage, family−waggon and family were<br/>
in. I found my noble horse still running <br/>
but on three legs. Rhoda was knocked out of the<br/>
carriage and [[Susan Cornelia Woodruff Scholes|Susan]] was lying flat upon the bottom <br/>
of the carriage with her feet hanging out between the <br/>
wheels and she was screaming aloud. I hollowed <br/>
for her to hold on until I came and she did so until<br/>
I caught the horse by the bit and stoped him and<br/>
rescued my daughter.</p>

<p>One of the ox teams had run on to <br/>
the horse and carriage bent one of the axes smashed<br/>
one of the horse's legs to pieces and knocked my <br/>
wife's <strike>sister</strike> ^niece^ Rhoda out of the carriage.</p>

<p>As soon as I got the horse out<br/>
of the carriage I went through the encampment to see who </p>",
42658.0,394,1850-08-02,"<p>was killed or maimed; but was astonished to find that no one was<br/>
killed and only one badly wounded and but little damage done<br/>
either to the oxen or waggons. It was a miracle that so<br/>
many escaped. I had to shoot my horse however to put<br/>
him out of his misery. This was very painful to me<br/>
but I was thankful that my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] children and the company<br/>
were preserved so providentially.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",08/02/1850
42658.0,394,,""">2nd of August</time> we lost 20<br/>
head of cattle and I started out on the journey all who were able<br/>
to go and the rest of us went out to hunt cattle. I found<br/>
them in the Bluffs and drove them into camp and as the<br/>
men were out hunting cattle with the assistance of the<br/>
women and children I drove the encampment on and<br/>
when the men returned they found us gone and followed<br/>
and overtook us.</p>

<p>We got along well until we came<br/>
to the tremendious bluffs in [[Ash Hollow, Garden County, Nebraska Territory|Ash Hollow]]. Here my<br/>
teamsters [[Benjamin Watts|Watts]] and [[Brother Bess|Bess]] both smashed each a hind<br/>
wheel to pieces and broke every spoke out. I worked<br/>
until eleven o'clock at night to get the broken waggons<br/>
into camp and failing left them by the way side<br/>
and walked into Ash Hollow wearied out.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in<br/>
setting tires and mending waggons and the following<br/>
day being Sunday we held meeting and I advised<br/>
Elders [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Hardy]] and [[Robert C. Petty|Petty]] to go on with the first division<br/>
and I would stop and mend up and keep some of<br/>
the second division with me. This counsel was<br/>
heard with great surprise by the First Division and they<br/>
did not feel to leave me but after much reluctance<br/>
the next day they left me behind according to my<br/>
counsel and journeyed onward.</p>

<p>After 2 days tarry setting 80 tires</p>",
42658.0,395,1850-10-14,"<p>putting new spokes into two wheels making new tongues &amp;c we<br/>
started on and camped with brother [[Edson Whipple|Whipple]] who went the day<br/>
before. We then made two divisions of our company<br/>
and Elders Whipple and [[George Bryant Gardner|Gardner]] were organized with me.<br/>
The 3rd Division had 26 waggons and the 2nd 18. We made<br/>
this division to forward us on our journey</p>

<p>After the usual toilsome journey hunting of<br/>
lost cattle dying of cattle incidents with the Indians &amp;c we neared<br/>
[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] on the <time datetime=""",10/14/1850
42658.0,395,1850-10-16,""">14th of October.</time> I drove into the<br/>
City at the head of the company and was glad to gaze once<br/>
more upon the Valley of the Mountains--the New Home<br/>
of the Saints. I met with Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
and many others and I drove to the two rooms which I<br/>
had made while in the Valley before. President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
had come out to meet me the day previous but he<br/>
returned and I did not see him.</p>

<p>The sickness and deaths in our<br/>
company occurred in the earlier part of the journey when<br/>
besides those named Captains [[Robert C. Petty|Petty]] and [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Hardy]] were<br/>
very ill and myself and family had some little sickness<br/>
with the rest; but on the whole the journey was<br/>
performed with but few casualties of such a journey<br/>
and moderate mortality.</p>

<p>I set about arranging my affairs<br/>
and those of the company concerning our stock &amp;c during <br/>
the first days after our arrival in Salt Lake city.</p>

with the Saints in the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and was called upon to address<br/>
the meeting. I spoke of my mission to the East and related<br/>
a dream. I dreamt of dying and going to the place of<br/>
departed spirits. I saw brothers [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]]<br/>
and many of the Saints who had died. They all appeared<br/>
to be in a hurry and I thought it strange to find them<br/>
so. I enquired the cause and was informed that the<br/>
time was set for Christ to come as the great Bridegroom<br/>
and they had not time to prepare as those in other dispensations<br/>
and they had to be in a hurry in order to get ready.</p>

<p>Next Sunday [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
address the meeting upon the words of [[Saul (OT)|Saul]] when he returned<br/>
from battle, ""Obedience is better than sacrifice. He spoke<br/>
much upon the subject of tithing and was followed by<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] who told the people the consequences of<br/>
neglecting this duty.</p>

in the upper room and had prayers before the Lord and<br/>
I read to them the speech of Mr [[George Copway|Copway]] the Indian Chief<br/>
and also the views of Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]] upon the Government of<br/>
Deseret which I had recorded in my daily journal.</p>

<p>The Presidency on reconsidering the<br/>
affairs which I had to settle for my brother-in-law [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus Carter]]<br/>
thought it wise for me to sell out his merchandize myself<br/>
and so I commenced to sell on the Monday morning and<br/>
the people crowded hard around my waggon to buy sug<strike>g</strike>ar<br/>
coffee &amp;c as they had not had a supply in the Valley.</p>",

<p>On the <time datetime=""",12/04/1850
42658.0,397,1850-12-05,""">4th of December</time> I met with the<br/>
Legislature. Governor [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] had requested me<br/>
to meet with them and wished me to become a member of<br/>

<time datetime=""",12/05/1850
42658.0,397,1850-12-22,""">Dec 5th 1850</time></p>

<p>I met again to day with the Legislature of the State<br/>
of Deseret. The House of Representatives and Senate<br/>
sat in joint session. As there were two vacancies<br/>
in the Senate by the death of Bishop [[Newel Kimball Whitney|Newel K. Whitney]]<br/>
and [[Cornelius Peter Lott|Cornelius P. Lott]] the Governor appointed Wilford<br/>
Woodruff and [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] to fill their places in<br/>
the Senate. I was also appointed by the Lieu Governor<br/>
as Chairman of the Committee on counties in the place<br/>
of [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] who delivered his farewell address<br/>
to the Senate and had taken his departure to act<br/>
as Chief Justice of [[Iron County, Utah Territory|Iron County]]. Many bills came<br/>
up to day and passed the Legislature.</p>

<p>Sunday the<time datetime=""",12/22/1850
42658.0,397,,"""> 22nd</time> I attended<br/>
meeting at the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and heard an interesting discourse<br/>
from President Young. His text was truth<br/>
his subject salvation his circuit the world<br/>
He said we see the child seeking the knife fork</p>",
42658.0,398,,"<p><strike>poison</strike> raisor or something to hurt itself with: so with many of<br/>
the Saints and Elders. They seek for that which is<br/>
not good for them and they know it not. Many seek<br/>
for things which tend to death and not life. [[Brigham Young|He]]<br/>
spoke of the desire of some to go to the mines their<br/>
use of tobacco and spirits &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the last of the year I met with<br/>
the Presidency and Council of the <u>Perpetual</u> <u>Emigrating</u> <u>Fund</u> <u>Company</u><br/>
and was appointed by the President a member of that body<br/>
and gave bonds to the sum of the thousand dollars for the<br/>
faithful performance of my duty as a member of that body<br/>
according to the rules governing the Council. [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Abraham<br/>
O. Smoot]] and [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard W. Hardy]] were my bondsmen.</p>

<p>Thus ended another year the former<br/>
part of which was occupied on my mission in preparing<br/>
for my return to the [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Valley of the Great Salt Lake]]<br/>
and in gathering up the Saints the middle months in<br/>
our journey homeward and the latter end of the year<br/>
in the necessary business of daily life and preparing<br/>
for Winter and in a Ministerial and public capacity.</p>

<p>Patriarchal Blessing<br/>
of<br/>
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruf]]</p>

<p>Given by Patriarch [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] upon his head<br/>
December the 20th 1850</p>

<p>Brother Aphek:<br/>
Beloved of the Lord—I lay<br/>
my hands upon thy head in the order of the Priesthood and<br/>
notwithstanding thy great age I seal upon thee a father's<br/>
blessing.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as thou has obeyed the</p>",
42658.0,399,,"<p>Gospel with full purpose of heart left thy native land disregarding<br/>
persecution thou hast passed through many trials and difficulties<br/>
thy faith hath not failed, thou art determined to persevere<br/>
in the ways of truth and righteousness and thy name is<br/>
written in the Lamb's Book of Life and is not to be blotted<br/>
out.</p>

<p>The Lord will grant unto thee everything<br/>
which your heart desires for thou art a lawful heir to<br/>
the Priesthood of the blood of [[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]] which Priesthood<br/>
shall be confered upon you in its fulness in due time<br/>
Thou shalt have power to heal the sick in thine house<br/>
and do any miracle that was ever done by man in<br/>
the name of Jesus when it is necessary for the salvation<br/>
of Israel.</p>

<p>Thy posterity shall become numerous<br/>
upon the earth and shall fill a station in the house<br/>
of [[Israel|Israel]] which shall endure unto the end of time</p>

<p>The days of your years shall be<br/>
according to the desire of your heart even to see Israel<br/>
gathered and Zion established in peace in the earth.</p>

<p>Thou shalt have health peace and<br/>
plenty while you dwell in the flesh. Thou art called<br/>
to do much good in instructing the Saints even to preach<br/>
the Gospel not only while you live but beyond the veil, shalt<br/>
gather thousands of the remenants of the house of Israel and<br/>
bring them to a knowledge of the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p>Thou shalt live many years and see<br/>
much good accomplished among the Saints, be satisfied with<br/>
life come up in the resurrection with thy former companions<br/>
and all thy father's house to inherit a kingdom which<br/>
shall endure for ever and ever: Amen.</p>

<p>Our Sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Sarah B. Foss]] and her family<br/>
also received their Blessings at the same time. Myself</p>",
42658.0,400,,"<p>and wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]] had both, (she in 1836 and I in 1837)<br/>
received our blessings under the hands of [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith sen.]]<br/>
father of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph the Prophet]] and First Patriarch in this Dispensation<br/>
presiding in that office. These Patriarchal Blessings of<br/>
myself and wife Phebe W. will be found recorded in the earlier<br/>
part of my histroy and they were now recorded together with<br/>
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] and wife's [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|sister]] and family into the Church records<br/>
of Patriarch [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] who at this time also blessed<br/>
my wife Phebe W.</p>

<p>Before commencing to bless, Father<br/>
John Smith made some remarks upon the subject. He said<br/>
he considered the mark spoken of by [[Ezekiel (OT)|Ezekiel]] set in the<br/>
forehead of the righteous by the one having the writers<br/>
ink-horn by his side to be the Patriarchal Blessings and<br/>
seal in the last days and [[John (NT)|John the Revelator]] had the same<br/>
thing in view when he spoke of the one hundred and forty<br/>
and four thousand sealed out of the Twelve tribes of [[Israel (OT)|Israel]]<br/>
He also spoke of the blessings of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] and [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]]<br/>
to their children the Patriarchs.</p>

<p><u>Synopsis</u><br/>

led them through the States and across the Plains to the<br/>
[[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]] into the [[Salt Lake Valley, Mexican Cession Territory|Valley of the Great Salt<br/>
Lake City]] making a distance of 4617 miles</p>

<p>I held Public Meetings 32</p>",

<p>I baptized 14 persons confirmed 14 and administered unto<br/>
twenty sick persons.</p>

<p><u>Councils With the Presidency &amp; Twelve</u></p>

<p>I attended with the Presidency and Twelve Councils 5</p>

<p><u>Senate of the State of Deseret</u></p>

<p>I was appointed a member of the senate of the State of<br/>
Deseret and sat in joint session with the Legislature<br/>

<p>I was appointed one of the Regency of the<br/>
University of Deseret</p>

<p><u>Letters</u><br/>
I received 126 letters and wrote 172.</p>

<p>Thus ended my labours and the events of my<br/>
personal histroy during the year and the Saints in the<br/>
Valleys of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] had been greatly blessed and prospered<br/>
and had been fast building up their cities.</p>",
42658.0,402,1851-01-04,"<p>On the first of <time datetime=""1851-01"">January 1851</time> I met with the<br/>
14th Ward of the City of [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]] to dedicate a new<br/>
[[14th Ward School House, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|school house]] which we had built for the purpose of schooling<br/>
our children. Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] delivered a very interesting<br/>
address on the occasion and took for a text, ""The fear of the<br/>
Lord is the beginning of wisdom. He was followed by President<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Richards]] in a few remarks and the dedication prayer after<br/>
which remarks were made by W. Woodruff [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]]<br/>
and Bishop [[John Murdock|Murdock]].</p>

<p>We met again at 2 o'clock and it was<br/>
moved and carried that Wilford Woodruff deliver a discourse<br/>
from the text ""Bought wit is the best if you do not buy<br/>
it too dear"". I addressed the meeting briefly. The<br/>
evening was spent in recreation under the direction of<br/>
the Bishop of the Ward.</p>

<p>I met with the Regency at the School<br/>
House on the <time datetime=""",01/04/1851
42658.0,402,,""">4th</time> when remarks were made by the<br/>
Chancellor [[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] concerning the classifying<br/>
of the scholars of this city. Much was said upon</p>",
42658.0,403,1851-01-06,"<p>the subject.</p>

<p>I also attended in the evening a meeting with the<br/>
[[Brigham Young|President]] and Board of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company<br/>
[[Edward Hunter|Edward Hunter]] laid an account of his Summer's labour before<br/>
the board and his report and labours were accepted.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",01/06/1851
42658.0,403,1851-01-12,""">6th</time> I met with the Legislature<br/>
of the State of Deseret. The Supreme Court was in session<br/>
Two men were tried on the Saturday previous for stealing cattle<br/>
and two other men were brought in chains for breaking into<br/>
stores and stealing money.</p>

<p>The Legislature opened by prayer<br/>
after the adjournment of the Court, business commenced and<br/>
reports of committees were heard.</p>

<p>Next day a code of criminal laws were<br/>
presented to the Legislature and scanned closely through the<br/>
day without the assembly passing one section of the bill<br/>
The Governor made some interesting remarks to his council<br/>
in the evening.</p>

<p>The Legislature met again on the morrow<br/>
and both houses sat in joint session. The criminal<br/>
code of laws was re-taken up and during the day there were<br/>
many interesting debates upon the subject from many members<br/>
of both houses. The Governor in his remarks said<br/>
the law was written in their hearts and it was difficult<br/>
to put it upon paper and even in criminal cases it<br/>
should be left much to the discretion of the Court. Only<br/>
three sections of the Bill passed during the day.</p>

<p>On Sunday the <time datetime=""",01/12/1851
42658.0,403,,""">12th</time> President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] spoke upon the subject of swearing or taking the<br/>
name of God in vain. A covenant was thereupon<br/>
made by the whole congregation to put down swearing<br/>
throughout the city and State. The President said<br/>
that any righteous man who hears <strike>any of his</strike> any of my children</p>",
42658.0,404,1851-01-14,"<p>take the name of God in vain he might whip them until he was<br/>
satisfied.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",01/14/1851
42658.0,404,1851-01-16,""">14th</time> I met with the Legislature<br/>
and they passed several sections of the criminal code and during<br/>
the next two days other sections were passed and the criminal<br/>
code finished on the <time datetime=""",01/16/1851
42658.0,404,1851-01-19,""">16th</time>.</p>

<p>Next day was spent in the Legislature<br/>
We had an interesting speech from Councillor [[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]]<br/>
followed by one from Governor [[Brigham Young|Young]]</p>

<p>[[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]]President of the Seventy<br/>
appointed a two days meeting of the Seventies which opened<br/>
on the 10th at 10 o'clock. After the opening of this<br/>
conference of the Seventies Joseph Young called those who<br/>
were to be ordained as members of that body to come forward<br/>
when 104 came forward and were taken into the State House<br/>
and ordained under the hands of the Presidency of the Seventies<br/>
They then returned to the congregation which was large and the<br/>
assembly was addressed through the day and evening by<br/>
many persons. The Spirit of God rested upon the<br/>
congregation.</p>

<p>Sunday the <time datetime=""",01/19/1851
42658.0,404,,""">19th</time> the people assembled<br/>
in a vast body. The Presidency, Twelve and Seventies<br/>
were in their places. The meeting was opened as usual<br/>
and then the congregation was addressed by Joseph Young<br/>
[[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] and [[George Davis Grant|George Grant]] and then President Brigham<br/>
Young followed.</p>

<p>President Young informed the Saints<br/>
that the time had come to begin to prepare to build a<br/>
Temple and the people must pay their tithing and he requested<br/>
the Presidents of every quorum to take the names of every<br/>
member of their quorum and they should sign a paper and<br/>
covenant to pay their tithing and they who would not do it<br/>
should be cut off from the Church.</p>",
42658.0,405,1851-01-20,"<p>He said ""the ground wants to be laid off for a Temple<br/>
and Garden and materials prepared this season. A font <strike>wants to</strike><br/>
be built and the endowments commence as soon as possible.<br/>
Those who went through the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] at Nauvoo know but very<br/>
little about the endowments. There was no time to learn<br/>
them and what little they did learn they have most of them<br/>
forgotten.""</p>

<p>Many other interesting remarks were made<br/>
by the President and he called upon the congregation to raise<br/>
their right hand towards heaven as a token and covenant that<br/>
they would help him build a Temple. This was done<br/>
unanimously</p>

<p>President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] next spoke and sustained<br/>
President Young speaking much to our edification and he was<br/>
followed by Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] who spoke lengthily and to<br/>
much interest.</p>

<p>The meeting in the afternoon was<br/>
addressed by [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] and Wilford<br/>
Woodruff.</p>

<p>During the day [[Truman Osborn Angell|Truman O Angel]] presented<br/>
to the congregation a plan of the [[Seventies Hall, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Seventies Hall]] about to be<br/>
built. There were 30 others ordained to the Seventies<br/>
to day.</p>

<p>After the General meetings the Presidency<br/>
and Twelve met in Council and heard all the ordinances<br/>
read over that had been passed during the present Legislature<br/>
and next day the Presidency with several of the Twelve started<br/>
on a mission to [[Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Brownsville]].</p>

<p>Returning on the <time datetime=""",01/20/1851
42658.0,405,,""">20th</time> from my trip<br/>
to [[Big Cottonwood Canyon, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Cottonwood]] and elsewhere I learned that some brethren had<br/>
arrived from [[California|California]] bringing a mail with them bearing<br/>
the <u>news that Brigham Young was</u><br/>
<u>Appointed our Governor</u>.</p>",
42658.0,406,1851-02-02,"<p>There was great rejoicing in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] that the Government of the<br/>
United States had given <strike>in</strike> ^as^ a Governor the man of our choice.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] had gone North and was<br/>
within 15 miles of the city. The band and an escort went out to<br/>
meet him and on their arrival in the city a salute of 10 guns<br/>
was given him; and fireworks &amp;c also celebrated his appointment<br/>
as our Governor. I shook hands with him at his house<br/>
and spent the evening with him and his Council there.</p>

<p>A Pretended Elijah In the City</p>

<p>Sunday the <time datetime=""",02/02/1851
42658.0,406,,""">2nd of Feb.</time> the congregation<br/>
met in the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and Mr [[Samuel Bateman|Bateman]] requested the privelege<br/>
of addressing the meeting in behalf of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] the Prophet whom<br/>
he said was in the city.</p>

<p>President Young made some remarks<br/>
before he spoke and then Bateman addressed the meeting<br/>
nine minutes.</p>

<p>President Young followed and said:<br/>
""We have heard what Bateman had to say but he has<br/>
brought forth nothing.</p>

<p>""Many have arisen in these last days<br/>
professing to be Elijah the Prophet but they have brought<br/>
forth nothing of interest to the people.</p>

<p>Will any one tell me what the office<br/>
of Elijah the Prophet was to be to the earth when he came<br/>
The answer is to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers<br/>
and the fathers to their children lest I come and smite the ^whole^ earth<br/>
with a curse. The answer is right. In what way is this<br/>
to be done? By sealing upon the head of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
those keys to remain in the Church and Kingdom of God<br/>
until the winding up scene.</p>

<p>The Elders of this Church know those</p>",
42658.0,407,,"<p>keys were sealed upon the head of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and still remain in the<br/>
Church. What are they to accomplish? As the Saints could not<br/>
be perfect in former days without the Latter-day Saints neither<br/>
can we be perfect without our fathers who have died for many<br/>
generations and those keys of [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]] confered upon the President<br/>
of the Church are to seal the fathers to their children and the children<br/>
to the fathers and to assist in welding the great link connecting<br/>
every gospel dispensation.</p>

<p>I see the wheat growing in this dispensation<br/>
ripening for the harvest. I see the tares also growing for the<br/>
burning. I saw too the wheat and tares grow on together:<br/>
I saw the goats and sheep both go ahead unto the end.</p>

<p>The Saints of God are increasing in<br/>
knowledge fast but they have got to be a hundred times better,<br/>
wiser and advance in knowledge before the end.</p>

<p>I have watched the windings and progress<br/>
of this people and the Spirits that surround them. I have seen<br/>
many rise as it were to heaven and in a moment of temptation<br/>
fall down to hell and loose their hopes of Glory. I know the<br/>
spirits of men and the invisible spirits that affect men and operate<br/>
upon them better than I do the faces of men.</p>

<p>I want to speak a little upon natural<br/>
philosophy. We sow the grain. It dies—rots in the ground<br/>
and then it brings forth a hundred fold. The elements which<br/>
surround us produce these effects. If we had a correct knowledge<br/>
of the elements and know how to control and seperate them we<br/>
could make bread as well out of the elements as Jesus did<br/>
when he fed the multitude. The day will come when<br/>
we can go a journey without taking any food with us. We<br/>
shall then have power to make it as we go along.""</p>

<p>Many other interesting remarks were<br/>
made by the [[Brigham Young|President]]. [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] followed</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting President</p>",
42658.0,408,1851-02-03,"<p>[[Brigham Young|Young]] invited all the Twelve to come and dine with him. We did<br/>
so and feasted on a fine large turkey supposed to be the first ever<br/>
killed and eat in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]].</p>

<p>Captain [[Jefferson Hunt|Hunt]] met with us at Dr. [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
office in the evening and made a report of Williams Ranch, said<br/>
he wanted to sell to our people. A company was to be<br/>
organized to go down and settle a stake or colony and to purchase<br/>
the Ranch.</p>

<p>On the </p><p><strong><time datetime=""",02/03/1851
42658.0,408,1851-02-04,""">3rd</time></strong></p>

 I met with the quorum of the<br/>
Twelve at Brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|Bensons]]. Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] presided<br/>
pro. tem. There were present Parley P. Pratt W Woodruff<br/>
E. T. Benson and [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]]. The meeting ^opened^ with<br/>
prayer by Charles C. Rich and Parley P. Pratt then<br/>
presented the Record of the Twelve Apostles which was <br/>
read to us.

<p>This record was since the filling<br/>
up of the quorum in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley of the Great Salt Lake]]<br/>
and it contained many items of interest.</p>

<p>After the Record was read and<br/>
remarks made it was moved and carried that the Record<br/>
of the Twelve Apostles be put into the hands of Wilford <br/>
Woodruff to be kept by him; and for him record such facts<br/>
as was necessary.</p>

<p>We then appointed a meeting for the<br/>
Twelve each Monday night.</p>

<p>According to adjournnment the<br/>
Legislature met on the </p><p><strong><time datetime=""",02/04/1851
42658.0,408,,""">4th</time></strong></p>

 to transact business for the<br/>
State.

<p>An ordinance was passed granting to the<br/>
community a liberal charter protecting them in their religious<br/>
rights.</p>

<p>During the passage of this ordiance the<br/>
[[Brigham Young|governor]] said ""We do not want the Church to pass laws to</p>",
42658.0,409,,"<p>punish crime but only to try members on Church fellowship. If the<br/>
members shall transgress the laws of the land turn them over to the <br/>
laws of the land; but we want to protect the Church in their rights of<br/>
worship and so we will every other sect that comes here.</p>

<p>When the Kingdoms of this world become the<br/>
Kingdoms of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will they all be<br/>
members of the Church of Jesus Christ and obey the Gospel?<br/>
No not one eighth part of them. No more than a telestial<br/>
kingdom is a celestial one and they stand in about the same<br/>
relation one to the other.</p>

<p>If a society of Shaking quakers were to<br/>
come here and settle in this Valley and wanted a charter to be<br/>
protected in their worship let us give them one and if they<br/>
think it right not to marry a woman let them live without<br/>
it and not compel them to it.</p>

<p>So if the Latter-day Saints wish to have<br/>
more wives than one to live holy and raise up holy seed unto <br/>
the Lord let them enjoy that privilege.</p>

<p>Now the Gentile Christian nations<br/>
and Legislatures guard very stricly against putting any law<br/>
to do away with whoredoms but they will make it almost<br/>
death for a man to have two wives but they will have as<br/>
many whores as they please and they think this is all right<br/>
but for a righteous man to have several wives like [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]]<br/>
[[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] and [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]] [[David (OT)|David]] and others to raise up holy seed unto<br/>
the Lord who will keep themselves pure before God they think<br/>
this is an awful sin. But if [[Brigham Young|I]] had power I would take<br/>
all good virtuous females from all wicked corrupt adulterous<br/>
husbands and give them to holy men of God that they may<br/>
raise up seed unto the Lord.</p>

<p>I have more wives than one. I have<br/>
many and I am not ashamed to have it known. Some<br/>
deny in the States that we have more wives than one</p>",
42658.0,410,1851-02-05,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] never deny it. I am perfectly willing that the people of [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] should<br/>
know that I have more then one wife; and they are pure before the Lord<br/>
and are approved of in his sight. I have been commanded of<br/>
God to pursue this course.""</p>

<p>Many other interesting remarks were made<br/>
by the Governor.</p>

<p>On the </p><p><strong><time datetime=""",02/05/1851

 the subject of distilling spirits <br/>
in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] was before the Legislature. Many arguments<br/>
were brought up on both sides. The Governor thought<br/>
we should learn to handle and controle all the evils and that<br/>
we ought to be able to controle ardent Spirits.

<p>Several days later I went to <strike>Toille</strike> [[Tooele Valley, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Toollie<br/>

<p>The Sunday following [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah M. Grant]]<br/>
spoke well on prayer faith industry and other matters and<br/>
was followed by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]].</p>

<p>During the intermission President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
Kimball and the Twelve called upon Brother [[Willard Richards|Richards]], and his sister,<br/>
[[Rhoda Richards|Rhoda]] lay at the point of death. We administered unto her<br/>
and President Young said she should live and not die at this<br/>
time.</p>

<p>In the afternoon President Brigham Young<br/>
addressed the congregation upon the subject of building the<br/>
Temple Tithing &amp; labour on the public works. He said<br/>
if every man was willing to do what was right there would<br/>
be no need of tithing. He would not be responsible <br/>
personally for the labours of every man on the public works<br/>
If the people paid their tithing. The wardmen would<br/>
get their pay. If we build Temples public<br/>
works or fit out missionaries to go abroad or feed the<br/>
poor it had to be by the tithing of the people.</p>

<p>He who spoke <strike>to</strike> of the merchants and<br/>
said that if they did not get their pay from those whom<br/>
they trust they were not to turn round up the Presidency<br/>
and Church for it.</p>

<p>On the </p><p><strong><time datetime=""",04/21/1851

 President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and many others<br/>
left the city to visit the bretheren South, I wote to Bro [[Thomas Kington|Kington]]<br/>
and spent the night with him; and next day prepared myself <br/>
to go on the journey with [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]]. He came along<br/>
in the morning and I went with him to [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoots]] and<br/>
joined Presidents Young and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and we started on our <br/>
journey.

<p>We had in our company 20 waggons<br/>
and about 40 men in our visiting trip 250 miles to our Southern<br/>
brethren <strike>and</strike> to comfort their hearts. I thought there were. was <br/>
a company of the same members who ever left as much<br/>
bsuiness to get on a visit as we did.</p>

<p>An Account of our Journey South.</p>

<p>After we left brother Smoots we crossed the<br/>
mountain into [[Utah Valley, Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah Valley]] and camped for the night. This<br/>
was the first time I ever was in Utah Valley. I found it<br/>
to be a spendid Valley of land.</p>

<p>The company went on in the morning<br/>
and I rode to the Fort on the South West side of the [[Utah Lake, Utah County, Utah Territory|Lake]]<br/>
dined with some friends on some fine trout and then rode<br/>
to our encampment on the [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]] Fort.</p>

<p>Next day I rode to Brother [[Isaac Behannan|Behannan]]<br/>
and spent several hours with him at [[Hobble Creek, Utah County, Utah Territory|Hobble Creek]]. I here<br/>
found [[Chief Walker|Walker]] the Utah Chief with his band. This was the <br/>
first time I ever saw him. I thought him an ugly<br/>
cunning looking chief. </p>",
42658.0,413,,"<p>Next day I rode with Brother [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] across the battle<br/>
ground where the Indians fought our bretheren with Brother Well<strike>s</strike> as<br/>
the leader of the Saints. He gave me an interesting account of<br/>
the battle.</p>

<p>We rode to Peletinck Creek where we met<br/>
the or teams who were appointed to go to [[Beaver Valley, Iron County, Utah Territory|Iron County]]. We travelled<br/>
to [[Summit Creek, Woodland Hills, Utah County, Utah Territory|Summit Creek]] and camped for the night.</p>

<p>In the evening a meeting was called to <br/>
organize the Camp. Brother Wells was our captain<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] President and [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] W. Woodruff<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. <strike>Benes</strike> Benson]] and [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] Councillors.</p>

<p>President Young while speaking of the <br/>
ressurection said that we should receive the same bodies that <br/>
we lay down even if our chest was blown to the fourwinds<br/>
of heaven.</p>

<p>When we came in sight of [[Sanpete County, Utah Territory|San Pete]]<br/>
Settlement three days later we were saluted by the fireing <br/>
of cannon and waving of flags. We were receieved with<br/>
much warmth by Father [[Isaac Morley|Morely]] and the people in general<br/>
There were at this time about one hundred families in<br/>
San Pete. They were farming had a school house <br/>
and had commenced a Council House Etc.</p>

<p>I called upon Brother Brown Captain<br/>
[[Dan Jones|Jones]] and other friends.</p>

<p>We held a meeting in the evening and<br/>
Brigham Young addressed the people. <strike>His belief</strike>  ^It was his belief^ that <br/>
the earth would not have produced for the Gentiles as it<br/>
had done for us and if we had faith and power with God<br/>
to have the curse taken off; <strike>as well as</strike> ^instead of^ the sage bush and<br/>
useless shrubs, we should have the apple pear peach<br/>
grape and every good fruit, but if this people do not take<br/>
a different course from what they do in some things then<br/>
blessings will prove a curse.""</p>",

<p>We met this day for the purpose of organizing a High<br/>
Council. There were twelve men chosen and ordained to be<br/>
High Councillors and I were ordianed to be High Priests under<br/>
the hands of [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] and W. Woodruff. The meeting<br/>
was then addressed by [[John Young Jr.|John]] and [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] and in<br/>
the afternoon by W. Woodruff E. T. Benson and [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]].</p>

<p>Next day </p><p><strong><time datetime=""",05/01/1851
42658.0,414,,""">May the 1st</time></strong></p>

 we left<br/>
Sanpete in the afternoon travelled 10 miles and camped on<br/>
South Creek and next evening we camped on [[Salt Creek Canyon, Utah Territory|Salt Creek<br/>
Kanyon]] and on the morrow we went three miles up the<br/>
Creek to explore it. We visited one mountain of rock<br/>
salt pure and clean and the body was more than 40-<br/>
feet high and so hard it was difficult to cut it with an<br/>
axe. We also saw plenty of the quartz rock and<br/>
issinglass. We rode to the [[Sevier River, Utah|Severe]] and camped<br/>
on its banks and shot one deer while it was swimming <br/>
the Creek.

<p>Sunday we crossed the Severe rode <br/>
25 miles through sage and camped on Cottonwood <strike>wells</strike> ^[[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Bro Wells]]^<br/>
<strike>and</strike> explored the other Kanyon but could not get through.</p>

<p>Next day we crossed the mountain into<br/>
[[Marysvale, Piute County, Utah Territory|MaryVale]] and three days later travel <strike>and</strike> ^with^ a pleasant morning<br/>
brought us into a beautiful romantic mountain scenery<br/>
a gentle breeze and the air clear serene and healthy.</p>

<p>But next moring we were met<br/>
with a tremendious snow and hail storm in our faces<br/>
and we suffered much therefrom. We started early </p>",
42658.0,415,,"<p>before breakfast hoping to get down off the mountain out of the storm,<br/>
and travelled 25 miles before we stoped to eat. We came in sight of<br/>
the Valley of [[Little Salt Lake Valley, Iron County, Utah Territory|Little Salt Lake]] about noon drove down into a<br/>
Canyon made a fire warmed ourselves took dinner and there<br/>
descended into the Valley over a rough road of rock and sage<br/>
drove to [[Red Creek, Iron County, Utah Territory|Red Creek]] and camped for the night.</p>

<p>We had pressed over the worse road for the<br/>
few days past that I ever knew waggons to go over for we had<br/>
to draw our waggons up and let them down with ropes the<br/>
road was so sideling and we had to hold our waggons up to<br/>
keep them from turning over.</p>

<p>We camped within 4 miles of [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Ceder City]]<br/>
and during the evening [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and two other brethren<br/>
come down to see us. We found Red Creek a good<br/>
place for a settlement.</p>

<p>We took breakfast next morning and then<br/>
started for Ceder City and we were met on the way by George<br/>
A. Smith and a company of horsement who came out to <br/>
escort us in. When we arrived we were saluted by the<br/>
fireing of cannon and the flag of the Stars and Stripes<br/>
We took up our abode among the brethren in the Fort<br/>
Brother [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] and myself stoped with Bishop [[Joseph L. Robinson|Robinson]].</p>

<p>We found the brethren had done much<br/>
since their arrival in Ceder Valley. They were about 100<br/>
men had been there ^three^ months had enclosed a fort containing<br/>
19 acres and 96 rods of ground ploughed and sown about<br/>
1000 acres with wheat fenced 600 acres of land built a<br/>
saw mill and had got a Council House up the first story.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday but as it was<br/>
a stormy day George A. Smith addressed the people for a short<br/>
time and dismissed them.</p>

<p>A company started out on the Monday<br/>
to examine the coal and iron but the [[Brigham Young|President]] and</p>",
42658.0,416,,"<p>council remained in Fort to hold a council meeting and do such business <br/>
as was necessary.</p>

<p>A meeting was called at 11 o'clock to ascertain the<br/>
minds of the brethren. It was found that about 30 wished to go<br/>
home 15 to get their families and the other 15 to remain at<br/>
[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]]. Each one made his excuse.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] then addressed them and <br/>
said he would express his feelings upon the subject to those who<br/>
wished to go home.</p>

<p>""If you were now on a mission to [[France|France]]<br/>
[[England|England]] or any other part of the earth preaching the Gospel<br/>
you could not sit down and counsel together about going<br/>
to get your families or going home until your mission was <br/>
ended. This is of quite as much importance as preaching<br/>
the gospel for the time has now come when it is required of<br/>
us to make the wilderness blossom as the rose. Our mission<br/>
is now to build up stakes of Zion and fill these [[Rocky Mountains, United States|mountains]]<br/>
with cities and when your mission is ended you are at<br/>
liberty to go and be free but only do right.</p>

<p>""When I go on a mission I leave my <br/>
affairs in the hands of God. If my house fields flocks<br/>
wife or children die in my absense I say Amen to it;<br/>
if they live and prosper I feel to say Amen to it and thank<br/>
the Lord""</p>

<p>President Young wished the brethren<br/>
to finish the fort and secure the grain &amp;c, and to survey<br/>
the land so that the brethren who laid the foundation<br/>
could have the choice of farms.</p>

<p>On the morrow the brethren assembled<br/>
again and [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] addressed them in the morning<br/>
and in the afternoon the people were addressed by<br/>
[[John Young Jr.|John Young]] [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] and W. Woodruff and then<br/>
President Young followed and advised to have the logs</p>",
42658.0,417,,"<p>so close that arrows could not be shot into the Fort. [[Brigham Young|He]] wished the<br/>
boundries of the city to be altered on the charter as there was a mistake,<br/>
also that the name was to be altered from [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Cedar city]] to the indian<br/>
name [[Parowan, Iron County, Utah Territory|Parowan]].</p>

<p>Next day we rode to [[Red Creek, Iron County, Utah Territory|Red Creek]] to see<br/>
the country. We had a feast at Brother [[G. W. Bayliss|Baylis]] house and our<br/>
exploring party returned from the coal and iron mines and brought<br/>
specimen and on the following day we rode to Summit <br/>
Creek where we could view the country 10 miles from the<br/>
Fort South. He concluded to return home on the morrow.</p>

<p>On the 16th the day on which we had concluded<br/>
to return we met the citizens to agree upon electing officers<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said he cared nothing about the feelings of the<br/>
nation who had driven us out. We should not follow in the <br/>
path of the political foolery. We should have one candidate<br/>
and but one as delegate to Congress. We can speak our<br/>
feelings freely here but when we vote let it be for the<br/>
candidate of our choice. Should we have two candidates<br/>
and they have about equal votes the United States would know<br/>
we had a<strike>p</strike>postatized from our faith and union or that we<br/>
were trying to decieve them. We shall stand better in their<br/>
eyes to take our own indipendant course and act unitedly. <br/>
If we have had one track the Saints will walk on it: if<br/>
we had two tracks there would be plenty of devils to run<br/>
on them. If we begin right we shall go right <strike>we</strike><br/>
<strike>shall go right</strike> if we begin wrong we shall go wrong<br/>
The United States are afraid of our union and so<br/>
is all the world.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Indians he said<br/>
these Indians are the descendants of the old Gadianton<br/>
robbers who infested the mountains for more than<br/>
a thousand years.</p>

<p>We dined together in the city of</p>",
42658.0,418,,"<p>[[Parowan, Iron County, Utah Territory|Parowan]] and then left amid the roar of cannon and drove to [[Red Creek, Iron County, Utah Territory|Red<br/>
Creek]] and camped for the night. About 30 of the citizens returned<br/>
with us for [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]].</p>

<p>On the 24th we arrived at Great Salt Lake<br/>
City. One hundred horsemen came out to meet us and we<br/>
entered the city with the roar of cannon saluting our return<br/>
Our journey had been 500 miles.</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday. The people<br/>
assembled in the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]] and filled the place and President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
addressed the assembly relating our journey over the <br/>
mountains.</p>

<p>The following was deliverd on the next Sunday</p>

<p>Synopsis of A Discourse<br/>
by<br/>
President <strike>Yo</strike> Young<br/>
Delivered June 1st 1851</p>

<p>If a man does right he shall have the Spirit of God to<br/>
enlighten his mind in all things; yet all men will be<br/>
tried buffeted and tempted more or less in this probation and<br/>
he that governs himself is wise. If a man is unrighteously<br/>
angry he should let it sleep and not show itself until<br/>
he is himself again.</p>

<p>A good man may be left to commit<br/>
a gross sin but if he had watched closely he would have escaped <br/>
the evil. The Lord intended for all men to be<br/>
tried in this life and if you build your faith upon a true<br/>
foundation that faith has to be tried.</p>

<p>All men have an apportunity of<br/>
appearing wise or foolish of governing themselves or<br/>
making their folly manifest.</p>

<p>[[Peter (NT)|Peter]] committed a gross error. Had</p>",
42658.0,419,,"<p>[[Peter (NT)|he]] been in the watchtower he might have turned away in the silence<br/>
and not denied his Lord.</p>

<p>Many have been tried and turned away from<br/>
us at a time when they expected to have gained something by it<br/>
and in doing so they have lost all. Others have been blinded and<br/>
overcome and done evil then their eyes were open to see the <br/>
consequences.</p>

<p>But if it is the privilege of all men to live<br/>
so that they can see what each act will amount to either good<br/>
or evil how different the prospect would be <strike>before</strike> of the world<br/>
<strike>of</strike> or even this people if they would live so from what it now<br/>
is.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] endevour to do right in all things and then leave<br/>
the event in the hands of God and am satisfied with the result<br/>
If a man is led or tempted to do a thing therof you do not <br/>
comprenhend the result of and that result not lead to good <br/>
then let it alone.</p>

<p>During the past week one remarked to<br/>
me that my observation of last Sunday ought to be made and was<br/>
good but it ought to have been spoken in the right spirit. But<br/>
I wish to say that I am satisfied with the power and influence<br/>
the Lord has given me. The Lord directs things according <br/>
to his ^own^ will.</p>

<p>I know my feelings and zeal would<br/>
make my words like a sharp two edged sword so that<br/>
they could seperate the sins from the people that they<br/>
should practise sin no more not to be tempted with<br/>
it; but this is not the will of God. The people still<br/>
must have their warefare and trial and if the storms<br/>
and waves overwhelm the ship still all is well for we<br/>
have a good captain at the helm.</p>

<p>Some people are very anxious to<br/>
reprove others while they are wrong themselves and do</p>",
42658.0,420,,"<p>not know the spirit they are of. They are ready to say, ""How do you<br/>
do [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] and [[Judas (NT)|Judas]]; Jesus and how do you do Mr. Devil and are<br/>
very pious and will go to hell and the whole world will go to hell<br/>
with the same spirit.</p>

<p>Awake ye Elders of Israel and make<br/>
your calling election, sure lest you go to hell with the<br/>
wicked. [[Brigham Young|I]] do not point you to the Sectarian hell<br/>
where devils are tossing you with a pitchfork, in the billows<br/>
of hell fire eternally; but go and mingle with the wicked in<br/>
the States wrangle &amp; fight with them get their spirit and<br/>
feelings and loose the light and spirit of God and you will<br/>
begin to feel the true state of the damned.</p>

<p>The wicked killed Jesus Christ out<br/>
of malice and wickedness and they did not know that<br/>
his death was to save the world. The Lord turns<br/>
many things for good which the world means for<br/>
evil.</p>

<p>The whole earth is filled with <br/>
misery sin and wickedness. I could find no worse<br/>
hell than to be confined among them. I labour for<br/>
the welfare of the whole people. I wish my bretheren<br/>
to be a happy free people that their course of life may<br/>
be such as to get an eternal and temporal salvation<br/>
I labour to effect this.</p>

<p>There is time and change to all things<br/>
There has been a code of laws given in former days<br/>
which was for all people—namely the Gospel of Jesus<br/>
Christ. In the days of Christ the Apostles<br/>
and Elders were sent out to preach the gospel and warn<br/>
the people. They did so but were then martyred <br/>
for preaching it and the Saints were killed off<br/>
the earth.</p>

<p>That time is gone. The change</p>",
42658.0,421,,"<p>has come; for now the set time has come to favour Zion to build<br/>
it up in strength power and glory — to gather Israel to build Jerusalem<br/>
and Zion to fight for our freedom and liberty.</p>

<p>We have sent the Gospel forth and preached<br/>
the Book of Mormon and the ministry of Jesus on this continent<br/>
in ancient days. Now the time is come to gather Israel<br/>
and polish them.</p>

<p>There is a great excitment in the world<br/>
about slavery; and the Abolitionists are fearful that we shall <br/>
have the Negro or the Indian as Slaves here. We have a few<br/>
who were prisoners whom we have bought to save their <br/>
lives. But what will the Abolitionists do? If you owe them<br/>
a dollar they will jug you up. Neither will they liberate the<br/>
Slave by buying them and setting them free. The master of <br/>
Slaves will be damned if they abuse their slaves yet the seed<br/>
of [[Ham (OT)|Ham]] will be servents until god takes the curse off<br/>
from them.</p>

<p>But they are not all the slaves who are <br/>
in the world. The whole world are slaves to sin and<br/>
wickedness and passion.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] have two blacks. They are as free<br/>
as I am. Shall we lay a foundation for Negro slavery?<br/>
As God forbid; and I forbid. I say let us be free. We will<br/>
be rich but we must be rich in faith first or we shall be<br/>
rich in no other way.</p>

<p>We must lay a foundation to manufacture<br/>
our own goods. If we do not we shall be slaves to our<br/>
enemies. We must stop living so dependent upon<br/>
our enemies and foreign markerts or it will make us<br/>
trouble. And this people must cease getting into<br/>
debt to the merchants for if you will get into debt you<br/>
shall pay your debts. But I say stop getting into<br/>
debt. Let no one come to me and complain that</p>",
42658.0,422,,"<p>he has got in debt and that the man will sue him and ought to <br/>
be cut off from the Church for you who get into debt and<br/>
wont pay your debts are the ones who ought to be cut off from<br/>
the Church.</p>

<p>Don't get into debt. Go in the Spring <br/>
and get the bark off the shrub oaks. There is enough in<br/>
this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] to tan two hundred thousand dollars worth of <br/>
leather; and here your hides are rolling over the earth and<br/>
you are paying 50 cents per pound for leather and you<br/>
pay the merchants 80 thousand annually for shoes.<br/>
Instead of persuing this course if you will lay a foundation<br/>
for taning leather making cloth and what we want you will<br/>
be laying a foundation to build and sustain Zion.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] drove sheep to this valley and<br/>
brought others and brought a carding machine here to<br/>
card wool. Who ^will^ put it up? I have done more to<br/>
stock this valley than any to man in the place<br/>
I want others to do something. Set up the machinery<br/>
and make the cloth.</p>

<p>Is there any woman in this Valley<br/>
who will make me a suit of clothes? See if I do not wear<br/>
them. What is the spirit of the times in the world?<br/>
If a woman pays a great price for an article it is considered<br/>
very nice and all want some of the same; but you<br/>
get a thing cheep and all are ashamed to wear it— you<br/>
are looked upon with disdain if you do; but if you<br/>
pay a great price you are very respectable</p>

<p>There are many practices not right<br/>
To see men ride through the street; they go as though<br/>
they were in a hurry to get to hell. To men of <br/>
wisdom such things look vain and foolish but to<br/>
the world it look glorious and the mark of fellowship<br/>
with them is fine clothing and splendor.</p>",
42658.0,423,1851-06-05,"<p>I want the Saints to adorn themselves: first their<br/>
hearts with faith and grace and then their bodies with the workmanship <br/>
of their own hands. If it is silk and satin all the better<br/>
It will show your art wisdom and ingenuity in temporal<br/>
things.</p>

<p>True freindship is not known upon the <br/>
earth. If it <strike>it</strike> is not among this people; but the friendship<br/>
of this people is the fruits of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br/>
This must continue to improve until they are perfect.""</p>

<p>In speaking upon the subject of tithing<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] thought there had not been $200 paid<br/>
in cash which there had been paid the merchants in<br/>
cash two hundred thousand and there were then<br/>
30,000 bushels of wheat due on tithing.</p>

<p>He said, ""Shall we dispense with<br/>
tithing? Do you want a building to meet in to workship<br/>
God? We want a Tabernacle and a Temple for <br/>
our endowments also a tower to hang a bell on and we want <br/>
to keep building up Zion that Israel may have a place of rest. If <br/>
we do this we do our duty. We have duties to perform and a<br/>
warefare to accomplish but the victory will soon be ours if we<br/>
can gain a victory with ourselves so as to have peace with ourselves<br/>
our wives and children we shall do well.</p>

to speak to thousands even to the whole world if they could hear. I<br/>
would not like to preach in this house to 20 or a hundred persons when<br/>
more than 1000 could get in here and then for 20 or a hundred more<br/>
to come and to have to preach from 20 to 50 times to have the people<br/>
learn when they could learn all together.</p>

<p>The [[John Van Cott|President]] of the Seventies called a seperate <br/>
meeting to day. I came and dismissed it. What if the Twelve<br/>
Seventies High Priests Elders Priests Teachers Deacons and Members<br/>
should do the same? There would be bare walls or the house to<br/>
preach to; and what good would it do? If the Presidency of the <br/>
Seventies have such important things to lay before the quorums <br/>
to get them together on Sunday let them come and teach us<br/>
all.</p>

<p>I now want to give counsel in this matter<br/>
from this time forth and forever; Let not the President of<br/>
any quorum ever again call a seperate meeting from the public<br/>
congregation unless the President of the church order it.</p>

<p>The Seventies should be here and all<br/>
the people should be here. Let the [[Seventies Hall, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Seventies Hall]] go and<br/>
all other business when Sunday comes. Let the Seventy of God<br/>
come together and hear the Elders teach. Apply your hearts<br/>
with wisdom and get it. If I am full of the Spirit I<br/>
shall not get any more than I shall want. It is the duty<br/>
of all to come here who can come and let The power of eternity<br/>
rest upon us and you should not be asleep but wide<br/>
awake.</p>

<p>When I contrast the present with the past<br/>
situation of the Saints it gives me a great variety of feelings<br/>
both good and bad joyful and sorowful.</p>

<p>I have seen this people waiding through</p>",
42658.0,425,,"<p>a school of afflictions. They then were prayerful and had faith. Their<br/>
trying situation made them remember the Lord their God; but now<br/>
prosperity is heaped upon you and as this people are to be tried in all<br/>
things: when prosperity comes some forget God was fat and wide and<br/>
do not realize the blessings they are enjoying.</p>

<p>Some who are in poverty abroad desire to <br/>
gather with the Saints. When they arrive and get rich they forget<br/>
what they have been. Could you see the feelings of thousands <br/>
who are abroad who desire with all their hearts to come here they would<br/>
be willing to lick up the dust of your feet if they could be here<br/>
They are still with the wicked. Bring them here. They look<br/>
upon many who were poor but now rich. They then desire<br/>
to be rich also. They want gold and will soon be willing<br/>
to sacrifice the society of the Saints and go to the Gold mines<br/>
and plunge themselves again into hell as it were from whence<br/>
they come to gratify an unlawful desire.</p>

<p>Thus it is with many men. Some<br/>
want to go to the [[Platte River, Nebraska Territory|Platte]], to [[Bear River, Cache County, Utah Territory|Bear River]], to keep a ferry<br/>
to get gold and wait on wicked ungodly men. Were are their<br/>
minds? Like the fool's eyes. [[Brigham Young|I]] told them I would not<br/>
wait on the devils for loads of gold. I would rather stay<br/>
here and serve the Lord All I want of property <br/>
is to serve the Lord and build up his kingdom with it.</p>

<p>I suppose many of the bretheren and<br/>
sisters are much tried to think they cannot have all they<br/>
want. I will tell you what ^to^ you <strike>do</strike>. Do<br/>
all you can to day and let the rest go till tomorrow<br/>
Do your duty to day and all will be right.</p>

<p>What good would it do you to<br/>
have 999 years to search and learn the revelations and commandments<br/>
of God if we have no time to carry out one of them<br/>
If any men want to get more revelation than they <br/>
can improve upon they are greedy dogs.</p>",
42658.0,426,,"<p>It will take twenty years to do the work that God<br/>
has revealed through the mouth of his servant [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], which<br/>
he laid out for us to perform before his death, even during<br/>
the last year of his life to say nothing of what he gave<br/>
before.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] will tell you your duty. Command<br/>
your minds from everything that is not for you to-day<br/>
and sit and worship God not sit and sleep. Worship the<br/>
Lord to-day. Go home at the close of the meeting and<br/>
get your food and rest, then come to meeting again<br/>
ponder and reflect upon the course of the Lord Jesus <br/>
Christ and his sufferings. If there is anything<br/>
necessary to be done do it and if an ox or an ass<br/>
falls into the pit pull him out; drive any beast<br/>
out of your neighbour's grain and put up the fence.</p>

<p>Do you meditate? Do you<br/>
pray in your families, and in secret to get the Spirit<br/>
of God?</p>

<p>You say you have your trials? I<br/>
have mine. I will tell some of them. Brethren<br/>
will come here to meeting; on Monday morning go<br/>
through my field leaving my fence down and let their<br/>
cattle and horses eat my wheat, borrow my cart waggon<br/>
shovel hoe and everything I have got and that without<br/>
liberty and never bring it home. If it was not<br/>
my duty to stay here I would lay my hands upon<br/>
some I could pick out whom I have confidence in<br/>
and would go and form a colony by ourselves and would<br/>
not admit of any person who was not proven.</p>

<p>I cannot get grass in the big<br/>
field but many of you do it; but I now warn you<br/>
not to steal any of my wood nor any of my<br/>
property for if you continue to do it I will put</p>",
42658.0,427,1851-06-15,"<p>a mark upon such men that they will carry all the days of their<br/>
lives. They are hypocrits and think all others are the<br/>
same. [[Brigham Young|I]] dont love them very well.</p>

<p>Again I say to you, it is not your<br/>
duty to get in debt to those merchants. I say you<br/>
shall pay your debts. If you say you cant pay, I say<br/>
you shall pay them.</p>

<p>I speak of the faults of my brethren<br/>
You may ask shall we forgive our brother his trespasses<br/>
if he repents? I say yes. How many times?<br/>
Until seventy times seven in one day if he repents<br/>
and asks for it, even all sins except the sin against<br/>
the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>If you will bring back my tools<br/>
grass grain or any of my property which you have<br/>
taken unlawfully and ask forgiveness I will forgive <br/>
you. I will not cast off any man until<br/>
he casts himself off. I will not reject any man<br/>
until he rejects himself. I will hold on to any<br/>
man as long as he has any prospect of salvation</p>

<p>I would like to say enough in few words to fill<br/>
three sermons. I have to deliver my discourses<br/>
in few words.</p>",
42658.0,428,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] wish the people to sustain the Priesthood as<br/>
the Priesthood. As to the opinion of man concerning myself<br/>
as a man I care no more about than I do the dust under my<br/>
feet. I dont care what you say about me, if you<br/>
will only serve the Lord our God.</p>

<p>Do this people live so as to know<br/>
the voice of the Good Shepherd? I wish to state one<br/>
item here which concerns you seriously. That is concering<br/>
the Indians here. They are ignorant have been taught<br/>
to steal and kill from their childhood and those who could<br/>
do the most of it were considered the greatest Braves and<br/>
Chiefs. As soon as they begin to steal here<br/>
many of you want them killed and compare their <br/>
circumstance with your own. You are taught<br/>
from your cradle not to steal or kill as it is a great<br/>
crime. Now do you kill a white as soon as <br/>
he steals? Weigh the subject well.</p>

<p>Those who wish them killed for stealing<br/>
a horse reduce themsevles far below the Indian. You love<br/>
them as well as I do but when the curse is taken off they<br/>
will again be fit for society; but while they are in their<br/>
dependant state it rests with as to use wisdom and judgement<br/>
in their behalf.</p>

<p>I say to the saints kill every white<br/>
man you see stealing and not kill the Indian for it for<br/>
the white man know better.</p>

<p>I speak to the Saints not as Governer <br/>
of Utah; but you and I are sent to save Israel not <br/>
to kill them.</p>

<p>Every Elder that crosses a certain<br/>
line I do not wish to see him; but those who do<br/>
right or seek to do right if they commit an error<br/>
we will forgive them. </p>",
42658.0,429,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] do not ask for influence only what God gives<br/>
me; neither will I give any man influence only what the <br/>
Lord and his own good conduct gives him; for if God does<br/>
not give a man influence all else will be of no use to him.</p>

<p>If I do the work of God all is well but<br/>
I will give no man influence only what God gives.</p>

<p>A few words to families who have not a <br/>
head to govern. They will be destroyed. The man is the <br/>
head of the family and should govern it. The hand may say<br/>
to the head if I really thought you would govern right I would<br/>
be governed by you; but I am afriad you will not; and<br/>
I want to govern you and dictate the head. Then the<br/>
shoulders and stomach will want to dictate. But does<br/>
not good sense tell you that your head should govern<br/>
your body? Your experience teaches the same<br/>
Your head didctates you what to do and when your head<br/>
dictates your body wickedly and polutes the body then<br/>
the head should be cut off so das not to polute the<br/>
body any longer.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] remarked that<br/>
there w<strike>as</strike>ere some bodies who could not act unless the belly<br/>
told the head what to do. <strike>In the strict sense of<br/>
the word</strike></p>

<p>In the strick sense of the word no man<br/>
is quallified to judge and rule until he is qualified to rule<br/>
himself and he king over himself.</p>

<p>It is thus in families. Children<br/>
and mothers have you a good husband and father?<br/>
Let the wife rule the husband and she will keep him<br/>
tied to the dish cloth and kitchen all the days of<br/>
his life and it proves a curse upon him</p>

<p>There is a curse upon man that I<br/>
would not take off if I could for in the experience<br/>
you have you are led to salvation through our Lord</p>",
42658.0,430,,"<p>Jesus Christ</p>

<p>Do you know your calling matters? It is<br/>
your duty to brace up your feelings as men have to do and be<br/>
mistresses of your house.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] go to the house to rest. The mother<br/>
says I cannot govern the children; I wish you would; but<br/>
this is not right. The Elders of this Church have to go<br/>
abroad to preach the gospel. They cannot be with thier <br/>
children. When they come home to spend a little<br/>
time they want to dandle their children upon their knee<br/>
and not go to whipping them.</p>

<p>The mothers should govern them<br/>
until the sons go with their fathers into the field. Then<br/>
let the fathers govern. I can govern my children<br/>
when they are with me. I would rather one of my<br/>
sons to stab me to the heart and kill me dead than<br/>
conquer and master me.</p>

<p>In government when any undertake <br/>
to govern out of their place they do not prosper <br/>
As an example; [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] undertake<br/>
to govern and control and set right my affairs at <br/>
[[Council House, Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] while I was on a pioneer journey<br/>
to the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Mountains]] and they were likely to have destroyed<br/>
many; but I said Peace be still and I saved<br/>
the people.</p>

<p>I say to mothers in the name <br/>
of the Lord God of Israel do your duty. Dont ask<br/>
the Father to whip the child. Do it yourself if <br/>
necessary and let the mothers control their daughters<br/>
until they go to their husbands.</p>

<p>But let the man rule and<br/>
preside over his household. And I say to the<br/>
men do not go home and abuse wives because</p>",
42658.0,431,1851-06-22,"<p>of what I have said but treat them kindly. What would you<br/>
think of a man who would get up before a glass and tear his<br/>
own heart out? As well of him as I would of a man who<br/>
would beat and abuse his wife.""</p>

<p>If I can see the motives of the heart of man<br/>
and know eternal things by the Spirit of God it is far<br/>
more beautiful than to hear the words of men</p>

<p>Should an angel come and converse<br/>
with any man in the congregation no other one might<br/>
know it. He would think the person spoke to<br/>
him as one speaks to another face to face when the<br/>
angel would not be seen at all only by the Spirit of<br/>
God or by vision.</p>

<p>We may know by the Spirit of God<br/>
what is in a mans heart before he speaks. At<br/>
all times listen to the still small voice of the Spirit<br/>
of God and it will save the Saints from many<br/>
snares.</p>

<p>If you get angry dont sin nor let<br/>
the s<strike>i</strike>un go down upon your wrath. I do not<br/>
expect to see perfection in man, not what the<br/>
world calls perfection. I have seen a perfect<br/>
Peophet and perfect Apostles: that is perfect in</p>",
42658.0,432,,"<p>their calling; but not the perfection the world looks for. If [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
had been as perfect as the people wished him to be he could<br/>
not have lived with the people nor stayed this side of<br/>
the veil as long as he did. We could not have heard his <br/>
voice nor have seen his face: he would have been veiled.<br/>
Israel could not endure the face of [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] at times.</p>

<p>The Lord expects us to be in the<br/>
path of duty. When we get in eternity we shall be<br/>
angels or Gods. We shall there advance to the Godhead<br/>
if we do right.</p>

<p>In speaking of the law, what a <br/>
simple thing it is? What is the law to those who<br/>
do right? It is not made for anybody but the<br/>
transgresser and the lawless and wicked. If we do<br/>
not infringe upon the rights of others all things are ours<br/>
in heaven and earth, time and eternity; life and death<br/>
because earth and hell and all that is therein is ours.<br/>
If we do not infringe upon the rights of any other being<br/>
we shall become Gods and fill immensity as our<br/>
Father in Heaven does.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] can weigh all the <strike>sleepers</strike> philosophers<br/>
and learned men of the earth in a scale and know just what<br/>
they weigh and can circumscribe them all.</p>

<p>All is mine: heaven earth and hell, —<br/>
wives, children; and I am Christ's and Christ is God's.</p>

<p>It is not known to us where the<br/>
stakes are set to God's immensity. Take the world<br/>
at large. Can they get to the end of their chain when<br/>
they get to the mill pond?</p>

<p>It is a startling idea ^to think^ that we are<br/>
worshiping a God who was once in the situation that we<br/>
are in ourselves. They had to pass through a<br/>
probation of pain suffering and the fall like ourselves</p>",
42658.0,433,,"<p>and be made perfect through suffering. The Son of God passed<br/>
through it and the Father would not require of a Son what he would<br/>
not do himself.</p>

<p>All our sufferings will exalt us in the presence<br/>
of God if we endure them patiently.</p>

<p>A word of advice concering leaving. [[Brigham Young|I]] <br/>
never want to hear of another law-suit among the bretheren.<br/>
Is it anything but good common sense to never have another<br/>
suit before a Judge to say nothing of revelation? It does not<br/>
require any great perfection to accomplish this. Let men do<br/>
right. Do your neighbour good not evil.</p>

<p>The Lord will burn up the earth and<br/>
clense it as you would an old pipe.</p>

<p>You think it hard to have to water your<br/>
land here but it is far more healthy than to have rain. It <br/>
was so in [[Egypt|Egypt]]. If It did not rain more in [[Illinois|Illinois]] and<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] that it does here it would be far more healthy <br/>
there. This could be reasoned upon natural principles.</p>

<p>A word more upon lawsuits. There <br/>
would not be a lawsuit in this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] if all men would<br/>
do right and were Saints; but the net has gathered all<br/>
kinds good bad and worse. Let twelve men get<br/>
drunk in this community and it ruins the place in the<br/>
estimation of good men. We have to bear the character<br/>
of drunkness and a few stinking fish in the net defile<br/>
it and the whole net stinks and it creates a prejudice<br/>
against it.</p>

<p>Those who were acquainted with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
know that if he dealt any in temporal things it created<br/>
a prejudice against him. He bought many goods<br/>
to help carry on the public works but the people<br/>
were ready to get it all away from him. So it<br/>
is now but I say unto all men who are Saints</p>",
42658.0,434,1851-06-29,"<p>put to your hands and help build up Zion and the Kingdom of<br/>
God. We are scholars in the great school and must learn<br/>
We are a Kingdom and must bring the Kingdom in subjection to<br/>
the will of God.</p>

<p>I join in testimony with the brethren, I wish to be a doer<br/>
of the word. I feel the importance of the last speaker Brother<br/>
Spencer.</p>

<p>Those who are not ready to meet the Bridegroom<br/>
will not be invited to the supper; and the time is near.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ is an example to all Saints<br/>
He was filled with wisdom in his youth; but in his childhood<br/>
and infancy he was like other children. It has been said that <br/>
he was in infancy wise as in manhood but this is not the case<br/>
He was subject to temptation as we are but was not overcome by<br/>
it.</p>

<p>If we have become acquainted with our follies<br/>
let us put them away and apply our hearts to wisdom. Let <br/>
us have compassion on others as we wish God to have compassion<br/>
on us.</p>

<p>We should increase in wisdom until the day<br/>
of perfection. ^out^ Apply your hearts to wisdom and it will produce<br/>
peace health wealth and every good thing.</p>

<p>Should you see a people carry out<br/>
the principles of wisdom, peace would be the fruit and you would<br/>
never see contention unto the day of your death. Ask the <br/>
world if they do not like a people who live in peace and are</p>",
42658.0,435,,"<p>conte<strike>l</strike>nted and they will say, Yes; it is beautiful.</p>

<p>Take the world of the present <strike>day</strike> time; and they<br/>
are like wolves and eat each other up. They fight and contend<br/>
and devour each other. The [[abolitionists|Abolitionists]] become heated and say<br/>
the [[Negro|negro]] must be made equal to the white man at the table and<br/>
all other places. They will at the same time turn away<br/>
the widow and orphan and put into prison a poor man for debt<br/>
^out^ Instead of this we should feed the hungry and do good to all men<br/>
as we have an opportunity. Then we have a Zion. His <br/>
peace in the heart.</p>

<p>We should bear an evil from a friend as well<br/>
as our enemy. You ask the Lord to bear with your<br/>
infirmities so we should bear with each other.</p>

<p>What is the necessity of doing wrong having <br/>
law suits and contending with each other. Go to law and<br/>
spend $100 to collect $5.</p>

<p>You may be told you are indipendant<br/>
and have rights. You have a right to do good and not evil. The<br/>
God I serve will deal out good to his Saints and everything<br/>
that is necessary for them and reveal his will unto them and<br/>
teach them what to do. He will not lie or deceive me. [[Brigham Young|I]] <br/>
will ask O Lord, did you do this or that? Did you bless<br/>
this man or that man so and so or did you suffer that evil?<br/>
Yes I have done this to try men. Do you want me to do<br/>
so and so?</p>

<p>If I am going to do a thing I ask is it<br/>
the will of God? If I cannot get the will of God upon<br/>
it I refuse to do it lest I do a thing wrong.</p>

<p>We want to do right: then we prosper<br/>
Is the people doing right? Is the Kingdom growing?<br/>
Are there principles in this Kin^g^dom to govern all mankind<br/>
with?</p>

<p>All that the nations of the earth now possess</p>",
42658.0,436,,"<p>would not make this people happy as they now are. Give us<br/>
the Kingdom of God instead of the glories of the world.</p>

<p>There has been a great stir to exalt the<br/>
[[Negro|negro]] and make him equal to the white man but there is a curse<br/>
upon the seed of [[Cain (OT)|Cain]] and all hell cannot wipe it out and it<br/>
cannot be taken off until God takes it off.</p>

<p>When a <strike>A</strike> person unlawfully seeks for power and<br/>
exaltation by taking the blessings which belong to another<br/>
<strike>He</strike> he will sink far below the other. As Lucifer the Son of the<br/>
Morning sought the glory that belong to Christ the First Born<br/>
and was thrust down to hell so Cain sought [[Abel (OT)|Abel's]] blessing<br/>
and took the life of his brother. The consequence was<br/>
Cain was cursed and his seed and this curse will remain<br/>
until Abel's posterity will get all the blessing there is for him<br/>
Then the curse may be taken from Cain or his posterity <strike>will</strike><br/>
but his posterity will be below Abel's.</p>

<p>All are slaves. Polititions are <br/>
the worse slaves. And if we dont do right we too shall<br/>
catch the lash. We are the freest people on the earth<br/>
Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Victoria]] is a slave. She had to ask the liberty <br/>
to marry Prince [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, b. 1819|Albert]]; but we are free. We have the right, <br/>
God and his Kingdom.</p>

<p>Let us not dishonor God his Kingdom <br/>
or our brethren. If we dishonour our brethren we shall<br/>
sink below them and their children. If the wife dishonour<br/>
her husband the children will dishonour the mother and <br/>
she must welter under it.</p>

<p>Honour the Priesthood in all its parts<br/>
be more faithful be more prudent. Administer to the<br/>
wants of all as far as you can.""</p>

<p>In ^the^ celebration of the Indipendance of America the city<br/>
of the [[Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]] poured forth her inhabitants in good<br/>

<p>The procession organized at the [[Temple Square, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple square]]<br/>
at 9 o'clock in the morning to take a ride to the Great Salt<br/>
Lake. There were about 140 carriages and waggons<br/>
besides the horsemen. The car containing the band of<br/>
musicians was drawn by 16 mules.</p>

<p>We arrived at the ^Black^ rock on the Lake<br/>
at 2 o'clock. We held a meeting were addressed by<br/>
Governor [[Brigham Young|Young]] and several orators who spoke much to the<br/>

went into the Salt Lake to bathe. at 10 o'clock the <strike>if</strike> signal<br/>

<p>We get good from all men who speak by the Spirit of</p>",
42658.0,438,,"<p>God according to their calling. [[Brigham Young|I]] speak freely; so may all<br/>
men. If we speak incorrectly we shall be corrected. We want to<br/>
speak freely that we may gather good whether it is in the past present<br/>
or to come.</p>

<p>Brother [[John Kempton|Kempton]] has been speaking. He professes<br/>
to be a scholar; I do not, but he has murdered the English language<br/>
to day. I want speakers to speak the English language<br/>
correctly for our childrens sake.</p>

<p>As to principles there are no principles<br/>
in heaven earth or hell but what the Saints have to apply<br/>
in their prayer place.</p>

<p>If we could understand all things we <br/>
should know that here is the place to begin to make the people<br/>
happy. If we could understand the dealings and Providence<br/>
of God with us and the object of it there would not be the<br/>
discontent and murmuring of the people that there now is<br/>
but we should have peace and joy and contentment concerning<br/>
spiritual and temporal things.</p>

<p>I would say that temporal and<br/>
spiritual things are one; but what we call temporal are the<br/>
coarser things which we see with our eyes but the finer or<br/>
spiritual things we cannot see with our eyes unless They are<br/>
touched by the spirit of God. Then we could see spiritual<br/>
things.</p>

<p>To say the spiritual eye cannot see temporal<br/>
things is folly but it looks unnatural to see people put out<br/>
their own eyes to spite their neighbours.</p>

<p>Anciently God angels and eternal things<br/>
were considered natural. My mind can see many<br/>
things when clothed with the Spirit of God that my<br/>
eyes cannot.</p>

<p>In speaking of hell it is called very<br/>
hot but our God is a consuming fire. Hell is here.</p>",
42658.0,439,,"<p>It is said the Devil was cast down to the earth; also that he was cast<br/>
down to hell. He is in our midst striving to lead captive the<br/>
children of man.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] want the brethren to speak freely, to speak<br/>
all that is in them and if they have an error let it out and exchange<br/>
it for true principle.</p>

<p>Some of the Saints want more revelation<br/>
mysteries, great things; but do they know what they ask for<br/>
or what they have already got. If the request of many men<br/>
were granted it would be like casting pearls before swine.<br/>
They would trample them in the mire.</p>

<p>We have enough now of the Key words and<br/>
tokens to take us through the veil into the celestial world and<br/>
lead us to the throne of God and what more do you want?</p>

<p>Have you ever pondered in your hearts<br/>
by visions and the Spirits of God eternal things even the<br/>
redeeming of all worlds and from them down to the smallest<br/>
things God has made? Have you ever reflected upon<br/>
the great system of salvation of the creatures of God?</p>

<p>Is man contented? He is not.<br/>
Can man alter the decrees of God concering the seed of <br/>
[[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] or anything else? He cannot. Why not<br/>
quarrel about Christ coming instead of the Father?</p>

<p>When the Father appointed Jesus Christ<br/>
the First Born to come and redeem the earth there was<br/>
contention got up. ^The second Brother^ Lucifer the Son of the Morning<br/>
wanted the honour to come and redeem the earth; but<br/>
Christ was the appointed one. It was his right by<br/>
appointment and birthright; but the war and contention<br/>
became so hot and the influence of Lucifer was so great<br/>
that he got one third part of the host of heaven to join his<br/>
standard; and when he was hurled down to hell like<br/>
lightning from heaven, one <strike>One</strike> third was cast down</p>",
42658.0,440,,"<p>with him. Where is he and those spirits that were cast down with<br/>
him? They are here on the earth and have blinded the children<br/>
of men and who are still seeking to overthrow the Kingdom of God<br/>
<strike>but this is all right</strike></p>

<p>But this<br/>
is all right and we should be contented with what God sees fit<br/>
to grant unto us and be contented with our lot. If the devil<br/>
had been contented and acted in his place he would not have<br/>
been thrust down to hell.</p>

<p>Any man who seeks to do a thing he<br/>
cannot do and should not do is cast into hell: it makes a <br/>
hell for him. When a man asks for <strike>a</strike> things <strike>of</strike> that<br/>
does not belong to him it makes him unhappy; but do what<br/>
God wants you to do and wait on those who are above you<br/>
and all will be right.</p>

<p>Why did not one of the Apostles quarrel <br/>
with Jesus Christ to redeem the world? Jesus set a little<br/>
child in their midst and said if ye do not become as this<br/>
little child you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>If you would be the greatest man in the <br/>
Kingdom of God you must be the greatest servant. You<br/>
will do more than any other man.</p>

<p>The Apostles did not quarrel to know<br/>
who should or should not be President. Why do [[Brigham Young|I]] or you<br/>
not quarrel because we were not [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]?</p>

<p>To <u>want to,</u> <u>and</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>is hell</u>! Never<br/>
seek to do a thing you cannot accomplish. Every man has<br/>
[h]is lot appointed him and he should be contented with it<br/>
There is the work of God ^angels^ men and Devils.</p>

<p>Is the Bible good? and the Book <br/>
of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants? Yes they are<br/>
good. Those books contain the works of God angels <br/>
men and devils; and if you dont want to be in hell<br/>
all the time be content with your lot. If you dont learn</p>",
42658.0,441,,"<p>to be contented <strike>with your lot</strike> ^you will^ in hell with brother [[John Kempton|Kempton]] who says he<br/>
was in hell one year.</p>

<p>Then learn to be content and you will be happy<br/>
Dont complain about you are not God Jesus Christ an angel [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham]] a man a woman ^a brother a mother^ a son a daughter or anything else; but<br/>
be content with the lot in which God has placed you: there you<br/>
will be happy and blessed.</p>

<p>The [[Blacks|blacks]] cannot take the curse off themselves<br/>
until God takes it off. So the [[Lamanites|Lamanites]] are cursed but is<br/>
there and blessings for them? Yes the same as there is for the<br/>
Saints for Joseph Brigham and Jesus Christ and all ^faithful^ men and<br/>
women in their time and season. So be content.""</p>

<p>Among the remarks of the President the next Sunday<br/>
he said,</p>

<p>""Why should we not know our own talents and abilities<br/>
as well as others? If we do not there is something lacking<br/>
Concerning singing there are some men who know sound and<br/>
^others^ <strike>those</strike> who do not and those who do not, ought not to sing. We should<br/>
act upon what we know and let the rest go.""</p>

<p>Upon the remark of [[Henry Garlick Sherwood|Sherwood]] that he thought<br/>
we were kicked out of the frying pan into the fire"" the<br/>
President said we were kicked out of the fire into the middle<br/>
of the floor. When people get their eyes open to see that<br/>
their interest lies in the building up of the Kingdom of God<br/>
then the Kingdom of God will roll on and the people will do <br/>
better.</p>

<p>I spent the next day in council and<br/>
heard two letters read from our friends Col. [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]]</p>

<p>Synopsis<br/>
of</p>",
42658.0,442,1851-07-20,"<p>A Discourse <br/>
<u>Delivered by</u><br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
<time datetime=""",07/20/1851

<p>Brother [[John Kempton|Kempton]] was very anxious to preach from the<br/>
text [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham's]] bosom. Liberty was granted him and<br/>
President Young followed and said:</p>

<p>""Bro Kempton has had his liberty as<br/>
is given to every man who speaks here. He has not<br/>
satisficed his mind at all. He may have much in his<br/>
mind but can say but little here. He is not able <br/>
to handle the Scriptures and know all the spirtis in<br/>
the world as some can.</p>

<p>When the dark sayings in the <br/>
Scriptures are understood they are plain. The<br/>
Scritpures here that speaks of Abraham's bosom is not as<br/>
given by brother Kempton. Abraham is in Paradise. <br/>
[[Lazarus (NT) |Lazarus]] is with him.</p>

<p>For me to explain is to tell the truth<br/>
A man that feels and talks to the people should be a Bible<br/>
of himself. If a man that teaches and leads the people<br/>
is not filled with truth so as to be able to teach the people<br/>
without quoting the teachings of others altogether, then he is<br/>
a blind guide and will go to help with those he leads.</p>

<p>It is the intention of the Lord to teach<br/>
man principle in progression until he shall know all things;<br/>
that he may rise through faith power and victory until he<br/>
obtains every good thing, even to rise to be gods, even the<br/>
sons of God. This blessing we cannot obtain without<br/>
experience.</p>

<p>We should not sin when we are tried, <strike>but</strike></p>",
42658.0,443,,"<p>and tempted, but overcome, which will give us glory honour and eternal life.</p>

<p>As fast as [[Brigham Young|I]] improve upon what I have more will<br/>
be given me. The Savior was subject to all that we were from<br/>
his birth to his death. He applied his heart unto wisdom. We<br/>
should do so too. Apply your hearts unto wisdom from day to<br/>
day and you will receive all that he did.</p>

<p>If I through out all that is in me what faults<br/>
I have will give place for truth and that which is good.</p>

<p>I feel to praise the name of God for all<br/>
that he has done for me. My heart is like [[Aminidab (BofM)|Aminidab's]] continually.</p>

<p>All persons see times when they wish truth to<br/>
pervail. Mormonism is all truth. The Lord has raised<br/>
up a Prophet and Seer who brought it forth and established it. He<br/>
was faithful unto death and sealed [[Joseph Smith Jr.|his]] testimony with his blood.</p>

<p>A certain prophecy says when the Book<br/>
of Mormon shall come unto the Gentiles the Jews shall be<br/>
gathered to [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]].</p>

<p>All truth is ours in heaven earth and hell.<br/>
It is all truth we want. But does the Church or Elders want<br/>
correcting? Yes for they have errors and false notions. The <br/>
net has all kinds of fish. We have some as cursed rascals<br/>
among us as dwell on the earth and we find evil here as well <br/>
as anywhere else. Yet Zion is here. It is in my heart<br/>
Peace dwells with me and good principles will prevail here<br/>
until all evil is overcome even in all the earth.</p>

<p>Let no man find fault with his neighbours<br/>
until he is righteous. I dont ask anything of others that<br/>
I wont do myself and never find fault with another about anything<br/>
you allow in yourself. Dont you swear scold and do wrong<br/>
yourself? Then dont find fault with another for it until you<br/>
subdue your own passions and the evil that is in yourself.</p>

<p>Some will do anything to preside over <br/>
another when they cannot preside over themselves. </p>",
42658.0,444,1851-07-24,"<p>Now remeber this that we will have Zion when<br/>
all wickedness is gone. We have got to fight, fight, fight, until<br/>
we gain the victory over ourselves. Remeber this and overcome<br/>
What are the feelings of [[Brigham Young|my]] heart? It is to bless <strike>them</strike> ^the people^ and<br/>
do them good.</p>

<p>The anniversary of the enterance of the Pioneers in<br/>
the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] of the great Salt Lake this day was celebrated with<br/>
much display and enthusiasm by the citizens.</p>

<p>At the rising of the Sun the stillness of <br/>
the morning was broken by the roar of cannon saluting the<br/>
rising D<strike>d</strike>ay. The mammoth carriage of the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Brass<br/>
Band was soon in motion and the band sent forth on<br/>
the wings of morning strains of martial and inspiring <br/>
music. The citizens poured forth from their homes<br/>
dressed befitting the occasion of a celebration and gathered<br/>
together a congregation of rejoicing people.</p>

<p>The order of the day was kept up by<br/>
the firing of cannon 110 times and the procession paraded<br/>
the streets. The escort consisted of the Nauvoo Brass<br/>
Band the Military Band and the Pioneers of '47 the<br/>
Regency; the Aged Fathers; Young Ladies followed by the<br/>
Mothers in Israel; young girls; young men and young<br/>
women. The Presidency and the officers of State formed<br/>
the escorted party.</p>

<p>After the escort came the rear party of<br/>
the procession, 24 Bishops forming a phalanx of the combined<br/>
wisdom and strength of the kingdom of God in the last days<br/>
The numerous flags and banners the various emblems of art.</p>",
42658.0,445,1851-08-01,"<p>agriculture and industry with the music accompanied the procession which<br/>
started from the [[Brigham Young|President's]] residence to the [[Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Bowery]].</p>

<p>The burst of feeling in music singing speeches orations<br/>
toasts &amp;c during the exercises in the Bowery was truly delightful. ""Here<br/>
was the power of truth the literature of God's Spirit the eloquence of Apostles<br/>
the laws of the Kingdom of heaven, the songs of Zion sung not in a<br/>
strange land and the harps hung not upon the willows.""</p>

<p>The shades of evening come over the city but no<br/>
accident had marred the proceedings of the hallowed day nor curses<br/>
drinking rabble or strife.</p>

<p>In many respect this day was the most interesting<br/>
one that had come in my life. My [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] myself and my children<br/>
making three generations of my linage were in the escort.</p>

I had 20 acres of wheat. Five acres of 7 headed wheat yielded from<br/>
100 to 70 bushels to the acre. The harvest was good this year.

<p>Dr. [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisal]] on the Sunday gave an account<br/>
of his procdings of [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] and his obtaining a library for Deseret.</p>

<p>I spent </p><p><strong><time datetime=""",08/25/1851

 in Council with<br/>
my brethren and during it the mail arrived from the States. It<br/>
was 20 days from [[Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Indipendance]] and was the largest up to this date<br/>
ever received in the [[Utah Territory|Territory]] being about 1000 lbs.

<p>I received three letters one from [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus Carter]] <br/>
one from my brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] and the other from my brother<br/>
[[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]]! My brothers informed me in their letters<br/>
of</p>

<p><u>The Death of My Step-Mother</u><br/>
<u>[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Azubah Woodruff]]</u><br/>
<u>March the 20th 1851</u></p>

<p>She died at half past 7 o'clock in the evening. Also [[Elizabeth Norton Hart Woodruff|Elizabeth]]<br/>
wife of my brother Azmon died January the 3rd 1851. They<br/>
were own sisters by birth.</p>",
42658.0,446,,"<p>I found from my brother Azmon's letter that<br/>
he was in much sorrow. He was baptized into the Church of<br/>
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with myself the last of December<br/>
in 1833. He was ordained an Elder and myself a Teacher with<br/>
the hands of Gerah Pulsipher. Elizabeth his wife with the<br/>
assistance of the Devil made war upon my brother and cursed<br/>
him to leave the Church. He had been in sorrow ever <br/>
since.</p>

<p>On my arrival home with my letters I<br/>
called my aged Father into the room with me and read him<br/>
the letters from his two oldest sons containing the news<br/>
of the death of both his own wife and his son's wife<br/>
My father was resigned to the Providence of God.</p>

<p>A Special <strike>General</strike> Conference of the Church<br/>
<strike>of Jesus Christ of Latter</strike>day Saints<br/>
Held in the Tabernacle<br/>
Great Salt Lake City<br/>
<u>Sept 7th 1857</u></p>

<p>There were present the First Presidency — Brigham <br/>
Young Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards and of<br/>
the quorum of the Twelve Orson Hyde W. Woodruff G. A. <br/>
Smith and E. T. Benson, the first seven Presidents of <br/>
the Seventies and the other quorums and a large congregation</p>

<p>President H. C. Kimball arose and said<br/>
the Conference was not for the benefit of one but for the whole<br/>
""Is the Store House full of wheat? Is the tithing butter and cheese<br/>
brought in? Some of you will ask can I get my endowments? </p>",
42658.0,447,,"<p>But [[Heber Chase Kimball|I]] will say not one of you will get your endowments until you pay your<br/>
tithing.""</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] arose and said:</p>

<p>""As far as you can exercise patience<br/>
you should do so. We are in comfortable circumstances and<br/>
now let us sit here and worship God and let our business rest and<br/>
let us reflect a little and exercise ourselves on our religion. Let<br/>
our houses rest and farms and crops and let the people be<br/>
still and not talk in the house or about the window.</p>

<p>In my meditations I am like other men<br/>
who refelct; and I marvel to see men so intent upon objects<br/>
that will soon perish.</p>

<p>How many there are here who ask the<br/>
question, ""How long will the conference last? I want to go. I<br/>
cannot stop."" While others will be willing to stop and<br/>
worship God.</p>

<p>Some Spirits are like the troubled sea, weary.<br/>
If I could have my wish about it, I would wish such spirits to<br/>
pass out of our midst, leave the congregation and let us worship<br/>
in peace.</p>

<p>We are such an industrious pople that we<br/>
could not commence conference until Sunday. I care as<br/>
little about our gardens farms hurders &amp;c as you do about<br/>
snuffing ashes.</p>

<p>If you get all the riches of the wared<br/>
you cannot hold them. If you will get the wisdom <br/>
if is your privilege to possess you will know that God<br/>
cares more for you than the ravens. If you seek the <br/>
Kingdom of God and its righteousness the Lord will add<br/>
all things else that is necessary</p>

<p>Our first duty is to provide for our<br/>
families, but we must take a course to accomplish it<br/>
Goals are often rich and the wise in legery. This is the</p>",
42658.0,448,,"<p>providence of God. We may be ever so rich to day; we may be<br/>
beggars to-morrow. This is the case with those who are before [[Brigham Young|me]]<br/>
Let me draw the line between the good and the evil. Have you not<br/>
had more good than evil? — more than you would have had if<br/>
you had been in the world? More peace than in the world and<br/>
happiness in the meditations of the things of God than in the world?<br/>
Yes you have. Then shame upon the man who complains of <br/>
his hardships.</p>

<p>The worse persecutions of the people are their<br/>
best days. I went to [[Missouri|Missouri]] in 1834, walked 2000 miles<br/>
in 70 days was so weak I could not step over the fences three<br/>
feet high. I now have better health and strength than<br/>
ever before. I would give all [[Geauga County, Ohio|Geauga]] county for the experience<br/>
I have had in six months</p>

<p>Now stay here. Dont go home until<br/>
conference ends. Many of the Saints forget Mormonism.<br/>
Any body who enjoyed the light of the revelations of Jesus Christ<br/>
must have the Spirit of God. The key to Mormonism is all<br/>
the truth in all eternity that ever was revealed or ever will<br/>
be that exists with God [[angels|angels]] or men. Where shall I go<br/>
to find truth? In Mormonism. If you get a truth<br/>
anywhere it is there for that covers all truth</p>

<p>When the light came to me sin did not<br/>
revice in me and I died but I revived and lived. I had<br/>
not consented to the death of any good man like [[Stephen (NT)|Stephen]]<br/>
as [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] did. But let him come to any of the <br/>
Churches reared to his name and the world would kill<br/>
him if they could.</p>

<p>I will ask you, are you accepted<br/>
of the Father and the Son? You will say I don't know.<br/>
Well it is because your minds are taken up with the<br/>
things of the world. Then let us stay here<br/>
until we know.</p>",
42658.0,449,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] am a Mormon or what is called so and I know<br/>
that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] was a Prophet. It was revealed to me long before his<br/>
death. I always thought while reading the <strike>world</strike> bible about a <br/>
Prophet that I would go around the world to see one or any man<br/>
who knew things as they were and not have to guess at them.</p>

<p>Everything will have to bow to Mormonism<br/>
or eternal light and truth. We have the true government of<br/>
all the earth. I know the path this people has to walk.<br/>
I am prepared for Mormonism. <u>There has no better man<br/>
than Joseph Smith ever lived on earth.</u> <u>Hear it O ye<br/>
Heavens,</u> — <u>O ye Earth</u> <u>and all men:</u> <u>This is my testimony<br/>
that he was as good a man</u> <u>as ever lived since Jesus.</u></p>

<p>Th<strike>ir</strike>e world will not vote for a man<br/>
because his religion governs. They will not have God govern<br/>
them, because of their vursed meannesss; but if God did<br/>
not or can not deal out justice and rule in righteousness,<br/>
who can?""</p>

<p>[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]], [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]], [[George Albert Smith|George A.<br/>
Smith]] and Wilford Woodruff followed in speeches and then<br/>
President Young again arose and said:</p>

<p>""I read that when the wicked rule the<br/>
people mourn. Ask the world, do the wicked rule?<br/>
Yes; and they mourn. Do they week a righteous man<br/>
to rule? No. If the curse has followed the rule of<br/>
the wicked will follow. But let them sleep on and<br/>
take their rest; but we understand the Lord has rent the<br/>
veil, sent angels to us and the Gospel is preached to the poor</p>

<p>The difference between us and the world<br/>
is that they say but do not, believed not. We say and <br/>
both believe and do. The world spend thousands<br/>
of dollars to preach the Gospel but do not believe it</p>

<p>When the judgements of God rest upon<br/>
the wicked and they are cut off then will be the gleaning</p>",
42658.0,450,,"<p>of the grapes after the vinetage is done.</p>

<p>Let the righteous reign and the righteous will<br/>
rejoice in the house of Israel. God takes up the isles as a little<br/>
thing; builds up and pulls down at his pleasure and why are not<br/>
the people willing he should reign? Because of their meanness.</p>

<p>Some may ask do not good men reign?<br/>
[[Brigham Young|I]] will ask a question: Should an angel come to President [[Millard Fillmore|Filmore]]<br/>
and tell him how to govern ^the nation^ <strike>it</strike> and he was to tell of it would they<br/>
not shut him up in a mad house? And if God was to reveal<br/>
to him truth concerning the people and he was to tell of it the<br/>
people would kill him. This is the situation of this<br/>
government _ the best on earth. But let the President sware<br/>
take the name of God in vain and curse God in all its<br/>
forms they w<strike>ill</strike>ould let him and ^stay with them [illegible]^ hail fellows well met</p>

<p>The nation will be damned and<br/>
go to hell who killed [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]: The States of [[Illinois|Illinois]] in<br/>
connection with the carthage mob, and the whole government<br/>
sustain it and they will be damned from the President to<br/>
the least member.</p>

<p>I think no more of a King of President<br/>
than of the poorest beggar. The worse scoundrel is the<br/>
most popular man in the nation</p>

<p>This nation is the first the Gospel<br/>
was sent unto. She has killed the prophets that God<br/>
sent unto them and their doom will be the neither most hell.""</p>

<p><u>Testimony of [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]</u><br/>
<u>To the Mob at Carthage</u></p>

<p>Willard Richards said</p>

<p>""We have had much testimony to day<br/>
I will add a few words. When [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] fell in<br/>
Carthage Jail and exclaimed ""I am a dead man Joseph fell dead</p>",
42658.0,451,1851-09-08,"<p>[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] fell wounded. [[Willard Richards|I]] carried him to another part of the jail<br/>
and covered him up. I walked out before the people and said that<br/>

privilege of addressing the people and it was granted him

<p>He arose and commenced his speech<br/>
by testifying of his kind reception among this people. He<br/>
had been sick among them he said and kindly treated.<br/>
The flys had been brushed from his face by a lady and he<br/>
was thankful.</p>

<p>He then refered to the Judiciary and <br/>
requested the people to sustain it and professed to be very<br/>
sorry that he was going to leave it. He then refered<br/>
to a report in circulation that he came here for the purpose<br/>
of being returned a delegate to Washington and other<br/>
things that were reported against him &amp;c.</p>

<p>Next he took up the subject of his<br/>
appointment and said that President [[Millard Fillmore|Filmore]] had appointed him<br/>
although he was a democrat; and observed that he should<br/>
not have been appointed had he not been a <u>capable</u> <u>virtous</u> <br/>
<strike>was a</strike> <u>good</u> man.</p>

<p>He then addressed the ladies upon</p>",
42658.0,452,,"<p>the subject of the Washington monument and wished them to procure a<br/>
block of marble and present it to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]; also wished them to<br/>
donate for the building of the monument and talked much about<br/>
[[George Washington|Washington]] and his battles and good deeds</p>

<p>[[Perry Brocchus|He]] spoke of the pers<strike>c</strike>ecutions of the Saints<br/>
considered them badly treated, had sent to [[Council House, Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] where<br/>
our dead was burried and had a spring of myrtle plucked<br/>
He carried it in his bosom. It was now dryed up. He<br/>
showed it to the congregation</p>

<p>In speaking to the ladies he said he<br/>
hoped they would become a virtueous people. He did<br/>
not wish them to send the block of marble unless they <br/>
could do it in full fellowship with each of the seperate<br/>
States composing the United States</p>

<p>He had read something casting<br/>
reflections upon the United States Government concerning<br/>
our persecutions; but he would defend the Government as<br/>
long as he had a tongue to speak or hand to lift; and<br/>
said the Government could not do anything for us as they<br/>
had no power; but if we wanted redress of our wrongs<br/>
apply to Missouri and Illinois where we had received<br/>
them.</p>

<p>This part of Brochus speech stirred the<br/>
blood of the whole congregation; and much more was said <br/>
by him calculated to arrouse the indignation and<br/>
wrath of the people.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] Reply.</p>

<p>President Young arose and said that Judge Brochus was<br/>
either profoundly ignorant or wilfully wicked in presenting<br/>
some sentiments which he had to the assembly that<br/>
day. How he supposed for a moment that Brochus</p>",
42658.0,453,,"<p>was going to throw out a challenge upon that stand in a religious<br/>
meeting and presented such sentiments as he had he should not for<br/>
a moment have given his consent to the [[Perry Brocchus|Judge]] to speak on that<br/>
occasion. The [[Brigham Young|President]] said several stood by and wished<br/>
to take up the challenge given by Brochus but he would not<br/>
permit of it for some might have got their hair pulled if not<br/>
their throats cut and he would not have it</p>

<p>The President then wished the meeting to<br/>
adjourn and the assembly to meet again <strike>in the Conference</strike> and<br/>
transact business in the capacity of a conference for which the meeting<br/>
had been called. Meeting adjourned for one hour.</p>

<p>After the adjournment following previous speakers<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] spoke. He said ""I will tell one <strike>tell one</strike><br/>
thing that will have a great effect upon us and remove the<br/>
mist. When we come to the house of the Lord bring<br/>
an offering to the Lord. I will make an offering to<br/>
the Lord and the Priesthood as [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] did to [[Melchizedek (OT)|Melchezedic]]<br/>
And offer the best you have.  Did not this law come<br/>
from [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] who was ordained under the hands of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]]?  Brigham<br/>
Young was ordained under the hands of Joseph to hold the keys<br/>
of the Kingdom of God. If you strive against him you<br/>
strive against God who sent him.""</p>

<p>After Brother Heber had spoken President<br/>
Young then arose and said:</p>

<p>""I will speak of principle. You may<br/>
think it is a novel Conference. How long has it ^been^ since<br/>
we have had the privilege of spending a Conference undisturbed?<br/>
A long time.</p>

<p>I would like to hear brother [[John Kempton|Kempton]]<br/>
speak or any good man. I will preach brother <br/>
[[Lewis Abbott|Abbot's]] funeral sermon and the funeral sermon of all <br/>
the faithful. His body is laid in the dust to rest until the resurrection. For ever blessed is the man</p>",
42658.0,454,,"<p></p><p><strong><time datetime=""1851-09""><u>September</u> <u>1851</u></time></strong></p>



<p>who lives and dies a Saint.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] will tell whether the messanger sent to brother<br/>
[[John Kempton|Kempton]] was of God or the Devil. If the messenger was<br/>
not of God he would know it. If the messenger was anywhere<br/>
else but here he must have come from heaven or from another<br/>
hell for we are in hell</p>

<p>Go to the world and preach the Gospel.<br/>
You will find some people as honest and good as angels as far<br/>
as they know; but do they have revelations from God and know<br/>
the things of God. No they do not. If brother Kempton<br/>
has had his sins forgiven and remitted without baptism so<br/>
could all men. But this is false. No man could<br/>
have forgiveness without the sheding of blood and baptism.<br/>
The Bible says unless you Keep the commandments you<br/>
cannot be saved.</p>

<p>When brother Kempton says he knows<br/>
his sins were forgiven before he was baptized he knows<br/>
not what he says. At times the Spirit of God is<br/>
given to men to see the Kingdom of God and they think<br/>
they are in it shen they have not entered the door of <br/>
baptism</p>

<p>Dont go and tell the different denomination<br/>
that because their sins are not forgiven that they are always<br/>
going to dwell in hell for if they are honest they will have<br/>
a glory greater than many who carry the Gospel to man</p>

<p>There is a good people among all sects<br/>
Gentiles Jews and Heathen as there is on earth. They<br/>
act according to the best light they have</p>

<p>What is the condition of this government<br/>
Light has come into the world and men love darkness rather<br/>
than light. They reject<strike>ed</strike> that light fight the <br/>
Prophets and shed their blood. For this they<br/>
are damned""</p>",

<p>In the afternoon the officers of the church was <br/>
presented and then President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said.</p>

<p>""I want to establish some travelling Bishops, a thing<br/>
which we never have done. When I approach the subject of<br/>
Bishops I pause not with a trembling hand but I want to take<br/>
time and look at it all day until we can see clearer than we now<br/>
do. This people stick to the world love the world. We<br/>
should use the world not worship it. No man is free<br/>
indeed until he is free in Christ and above the world. Don't<br/>
worship the world. You will not be free. Is there any<br/>
one that has anything but what God gave him. You cannot<br/>
make one hair white or black. Now it is our duty to <br/>
feed clothe and sustain the families of those who are in<br/>
the vineyard preaching. If we let them suffer and they die their<br/>
blood will be required at our hands. We as a people have never<br/>
done it ^yet^;  but it is time it were done. The Bishops are peproved<br/>
They dont do their duty.""</p>

<p>[[John Banks|John Banks]] and [[Nathaniel Henry Felt|N. H. Felt]] were ordained Travelling Bishops<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]], [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] and [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] were set apart<br/>
to go back to [[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Kansville]] and gather out all the Saints in that<br/>
region.  [[Samuel Whitney Richards|Samuel Richards]] was appointed to go to [[England|England]] and<br/>
also [[Willard Trowbridge Snow|Willard Snow]] and [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]]; [[Daniel Carnes|D. Carnes]] to [[Germany|Germany]]<br/>
and [[Dorr Purdy Curtis|Dorr P. Curtis]] and [[Vincent Shurtleff|Venson Shirtliff]] on a foreign mission<br/>
and Dr. [[John Lewis Dunyon|Dunyan]] to the Eastern States.</p>

<p>[[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] the Patriarch said he had<br/>
been in the work since Jan 1832 and was about the oldest<br/>
man here. ""I was ordained an Elder under the hands of <br/>
[[Joseph Wakefield|Joseph Wakefield]]. The Smith family was chosen to<br/>
bring forth this work. My team halled the first load<br/>
of stone to build the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland Temple]]. My son [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A]]. drove the teem. There were four brothers of us<br/>
in the stand in Kirtland. I am now left alone<br/>

<p>night before they were killed. Next day three guns were snaped at <br/>
me. [[John Smith, b. 1781|I]] could not weep for a long time. When I did weep 2<br/>
wept much. I have laboured much from that day until this to<br/>
keep things right. It is said that it is the little foxes that spoil<br/>
the vines. We have a Prophet for a leader. Now pay your<br/>
tithing and make good measure when you sell anything, and fulfil<br/>
all your covenants if they are made right. We shall then prosper<br/>
in this Valley. I am an old man and cannot say much<br/>
but I will write a piece to be published in the paper.""</p>

<p>[[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] said ""I am going to make<br/>
an offering to President [[Brigham Young|Young]]. [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] paid tithes to<br/>
[[Melchizedek (OT)|Michezedick]]. A certain woman gave a purse others filled <br/>
it. Brother [[Joseph Rhodes|Rhodes]] gave sixty four pounds of gold for<br/>
the public works. He has not laked anything. You<br/>
should give the best you have to the Lord. He will<br/>
pour you out a blessing that there will not be room<br/>
enough to receive it.""</p>

<p>After others had spoken President Young<br/>
said</p>

<p>""I will put the motion, will the sisters vote to quit<br/>
using tea and coffee? The brethren have voted not to<br/>
use tobacco.</p>

<p><strike>I will speak of the Bishops. I spoke of<br/>
them Yesterday and reproved them sharply. Some<br/>
wanted me to offer an apology to them. I will not.<br/>
I will see them in hell before I will do it. If this people<br/>
do not do better than the Bishops have they will and<br/>
if you do not do better than you have done you will <br/>
go to hell.</strike></p>

<p><strike>I will begin with myself. I have<br/>
taught the Bishops principle and their duty. Ask<br/>
them if they can do it. No. I will cut the Bishops<br/>
off from the church if they do not do better. Did I</strike></p>",

<p><strike>ever council them wrong. You have trampled my counsel<br/>
under foot. I shall not shrink from duty.</strike></p>

<p>I say to all old and young learn to pray<br/>
Pray in your families. Be content in all circumstances<br/>
where the Lord shall place you.; cease your contentions<br/>
one with another; never go to law; gather your famlies<br/>
together and pray for me and my brethren and yourselves until<br/>
a blessing rests on us.""</p>

<p>Others spoke and then President [[Brigham Young|Young]] again<br/>
during the day. He said he wished to say a few words to the <br/>
Mormon Battalion</p>

<p>""Those who are wanting their extra pay are<br/>
applying to Williams Blair and Babbit. If you apply to<br/>
those men and give them the papers and they cheat you out<br/>
of it dont complain and I say to those men not to take<br/>
any papers from those <strike>f</strike>who have had their pay or sold<br/>
their claims to others. If you want your pay apply<br/>
here and you can get it.</p>

<p>You did not enlist to get $8 per month<br/>
They enlisted us to kill us and because we speak our sentiments<br/>
we are accused of treason. I dont ask any odds of the <br/>
United States. I will express my feelings. To drive<br/>
us from our mullions and our possessions ^and then require us to fight their battles^ is not right.</p>

<p>I shall pay my tithing. The Twelve<br/>
will pay one tenth of their possessions and the Bishops and<br/>
all will pay their tithing.</p>

<p>This is the Kingdom of God and if it<br/>
falls I am willing to fall with it. I would rather fall<br/>
then stand if the Priesthood falls""</p>

<p>All the people covenanted to pay their<br/>
tithing and Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] and others spoke. Upon the<br/>
remarks of Elder [[John Banks|John Banks]] upon the law of liberty<br/>
President Young said:</p>",
42658.0,458,1851-10-06,"<p><u>September:</u> <u>1851.</u> <u>October</u></p>

<p>The liberty of the holy Gospel is peace and righteousness<br/>
We have no liberty to take away another man's rights; but the<br/>
first principle of liberty is resignation and submission for go<br/>
where you will to heaven or hell you have to submit to laws<br/>
We are at liberty to adopt every holy principle to all eternity</p>

<p>Go East West North or South. Keep<br/>
everything ^you want for^yoursel<strike>f</strike>ves wife children houses and cattle and create<br/>
out of the elements everything you can; Yet you are not at liberty<br/>
to infringe upon the rights of man.</p>

<p>You may have the privilege to<br/>
do all things that is done in heaven. Organize the elaments<br/>
give commands and rule over Kingdoms but the subject to<br/>
such laws as you are under. The law of liberty is to<br/>
do right for God to all eternity. The opposite principle<br/>
is to be discontented with things: to be different from what<br/>
they are. This is hell and all the hell there is.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] dont care how things are if I <br/>
do right. We shall find the law of liberty to<br/>
be eternal life light and peace which will increase to<br/>
all eternity</p>

<p>We ought not to do an evil to cause<br/>
pain to any creature; still there are some things which<br/>
appear to be evil that I know to be good.</p>

<p>God will increase his Kingdom to<br/>
all eternity. [[Abraham (OT)|Abrahams]] seed will reign as kings of<br/>
kings and lords of lords and to his seed there is no end</p>

<p>Let this people live and do right<br/>
and the blessing of God will attend you to all<br/>
eternity</p>

<p>and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] preached and in the afternoon the President<br/>

.

<p>We hear the brethren arise and return thanks for the<br/>
blessings received. We can respond to it. The work is<br/>
of all importance to the human family. The brethren are all<br/>
willing to do right; and they say Lord not my will but thine<br/>
be done. If the Lord should say come and preach to us we<br/>
would say Amen to it.</p>

<p>The Lord has his means to carry on his<br/>
work and also his own means to do it. When the people's<br/>
hearts are prepared to do the will of God the victory is ours</p>

<p>If we come to understanding so as to <br/>
have the organization of the Kingdom so that every one will<br/>
act in unison like a beautiful piece of machinery we gain<br/>
the victory. We shall then know how to order our spe<strike>e</strike>ach<br/>
and converstaion aright before God</p>

<p>This is a good people. Cannot we<br/>
be better? We have faith and knowledge. Cannot we<br/>
have more of it? Yes there is an eternity of it</p>

<p>We have learned to obey by the things<br/>
we suffer. But what do we behold? There is evil surmising<br/>
sp<strike>ad</strike>eaking and doing. The evil intruders ha<strike>d</strike>ve not left us<br/>
Who is keeping the commandment that thou shalt love thy<br/>
neighbour as thyself? We will save his neighbours<br/>
garden crops &amp;c. We shall then believe and pra<strike>l</strike>ctise</p>",
42658.0,460,,"<p><u>October:</u> <u>1851.</u></p>

<p>all the commands. We shall have but one common interest. [[Brigham Young|I]]<br/>
dont care what you believe if you practise right and as though you<br/>
loved the Lord and then you will do right.</p>

<p>There is no school like your own experiance<br/>
When I heard [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] speak I thought of former days<br/>
when men from [[Canada, British North America|Canida]] and other places would stop 50 miles<br/>
this side of [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] leave the money with the wife go and<br/>
see [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] say how I love you; but let Joseph ask them for<br/>
a few dollars and they would immediately dodge at it</p>

<p>While you were in the world you<br/>
would go away. Now you are here I cannot get you<br/>
to go to the fat Vallies because [[Warsaw, Hancock County, Illinois|Warsaw]] and [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] are not<br/>
there. I felt like crying about [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa's]] company. They<br/>
were ready to go to hell. How ready the perople are to go to<br/>
hell! Let the eyes of the Saints be open. I had<br/>
to <strike>be plead</strike> pled with Amasa Lyman and company for days not<br/>
to go. I could not stay them. Now I want you<br/>
to go and you wont go. I want to have you go to<br/>
[[Iron County, Utah Territory|Iron County]]. The people here are so full of wheat and <br/>
good things that they loathe it. if you dont want to pay <br/>
your tithing the Lord dont want your tithing until you<br/>
go into hell. If you dont want to save yourselves<br/>
nor your children nor your dead dont you pay your<br/>
tithing; if you do want to save them pay your tithing<br/>
for it is for your benefit not mine. You cannot<br/>
do the Lord any good in it nor add to his glory<br/>
but it is for yourself</p>

<p>The cattle have come in well of late<br/>
and I think the best have been sent in. You should<br/>
be industrious and saving. I do not want <strike>an</strike>my<br/>
children to be lazy. If I die I do not want any<br/>
man to foster them in <strike>laziness</strike> idleness. I wish my boys<br/>
had to work as I did for a living.</p>",

<p><u>General Conference</u><br/>
<u>October the 6th</u></p>

<p>Conference assembled according to adjournment.<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said the time had come to commence<br/>
the business of the Semi-Annual Conference. The business of<br/>
the last Conference was productive of more good than any Conference<br/>
we ever held. The keeping of the ""Word of Wisdo"" has done<br/>
much good. I will be exceedingly glad when we arrice at<br/>
wisdom in all things.</p>

<p>The Word of Wisdom was given in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]<br/>
twenty years ago for the benefit of all Saints. When we<br/>
live 20 or fifty years longer we shall see that we do not<br/>
understand much of the Word of Wisdom.  We are but babies<br/>
in understanding wisdom. Who understands it were all<br/>
spoken that might be spoken. There is but one system<br/>
of explaining any revelation and that is the revelation of Jesus <br/>
Christ in the heart of man when he prossesses the Holy Ghost</p>

<p>We are forbidden to eat meat in hot<br/>
weather. Hot drinks and tobacco is not good for man<br/>
You should not eat to over loading your stomach. There<br/>
is a greater lack in my system of wisdom of tempering my<br/>
food and ^exercise^ than in eating meat or tobacoo.</p>

<p>Tithing is coming in so fast there<br/>
will  not be room to receive it.</p>

<p>I wanted this Conference to come together<br/>
so that I could see their faces not to scold them. I want<br/>
to see the faces of the Saints. They look better to me than<br/>
all the glories of the earth. I said when the brethren got<br/>
out of prison I wanted o sit and look at them three weeks</p>

<p>Our Graineries and Store House are full</p>",
42658.0,462,,"<p><time datetime=""1851-10""><u>October</u> <u>1851</u></time></p>

<p>of wheat and good things.</p>

<p>If this people are rich beautiful and happy, <br/>
I am with them; if they are miserable, I am still with them<br/>
if the people are not all crowned and saved none of us will be</p>

<p>It is in vain for one man to build himself<br/>
up and neglect his brother's interest. He will fail in it.</p>

<p>We must begin to manufacture all we want or<br/>
we are slaves to everything in all the earth</p>

<p>Everything is against Mormonism, and Mormonism <br/>
is against everything; everything is against us. Hear it<br/>
O Earth for the Kingdom of God is against all earth and hell<br/>
This is true and we shall fight them until the kingdoms<br/>
of this world become the Kingdoms of our God. We shall<br/>
fight battle after battle until the victory is won. We<br/>
have to fight and lay down our lives for Christ's<br/>
sake.</p>

<p>We now want to gather companies to<br/>
go to the different VAlleys. I want the potters to remain<br/>
here and work at their business.</p>

<p>Jesus descended below all things<br/>
before he assended above all things. We have to sacrifice<br/>
ever freely in order to be exalted before God. I once<br/>
said I will go and build me a house on the hill<br/>
out of the mud. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said you will stay where<br/>
you are. This was enough. I dodged as quick <br/>
as I could. I said, Enough. Since I have been <br/>
willing to be governed by circumstances that have <br/>
surrounded me and leave the event in the hands of<br/>
God""</p>

<p>Judge [[Zerubbabel Snow|Snow]] then spoke and afterwards<br/>
the President said:<br/>
""At our Conference we appointed [[Nathaniel Henry Felt|Felt]] and<br/>
[[John Banks|Banks]] to be travelling Bishops to visit other Bishops and</p>",
42658.0,463,,"<p><u>October</u> <u>1851</u> <u>December</u><br/>
call them to an account and see that they are faithful Bishops<br/>
and you should feed the poor and do your duty untl the Spirit<br/>
of God rests upon you and you hold the Keys of the Melchezedick<br/>
Priesthood and the power of it rest upon you forever.""</p>

<p>Brothers [[John Banks|Banks]] and [[Nathaniel Henry Felt|Felt]] were then<br/>
ordained under the hands of the Presidency.</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] [[David Fullmer|O. Fulmer]] <strike>and</strike><br/>
[[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] ^and [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]]^ were appointed as missionaries and after a discourses<br/>
from [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]], and from [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] upon the <br/>
opening of the new settlements President [[Brigham Young|Young]] closed with<br/>
our address upon the education of our children. This was<br/>
one of the most interesting conferences ever held by this people.</p>

<p>President Young's Medical Lecture.</p>

<p>Delivered before the Board of Health<br/>
At [[Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]]<br/>
<time datetime=""1851-12"">Dec. 1851</time></p>

<p>""I wish to impart intelligence to the people. My first<br/>
proposition is the science of <strike>health</strike> medicine. The study and<br/>
practice of medicine as a science, if it may be called a<br/>
science is the most imperfect of my science in exist<strike>e</strike>ance<br/>
as it is practised by the doctors of the present day. The<br/>
doctors and priests of the day send more to death and<br/>
hell than anywhere else. About one in a million may<br/>
get some glory. A bigger set of cursed scoundrals<br/>
never graced the earth than that class. Surgary is a<br/>
different class and is very necessary in many instances and<br/>
that system can be learned. But to learn the system<br/>
of man they cannot: no more learn that than they can<br/>
learn the heavens</p>",
42658.0,464,,"<p>A worse set of ignoramuses do not walk the earth<br/>
They do not know how to turn wind in a man's body when it gets<br/>
cross ways. If you cut their infernal throats the people will<br/>
live. I know what this society is here for. It is to<br/>
import what knowledge they have to others. But I have seen<br/>
the fally of the doctors even at my own doors. Take them as<br/>
a whole they are the most damnable set on earth. Their practices<br/>
are infamous and their medicines produce death. If the people<br/>
want to eat calomel let them do it and be damned; but dont<br/>
feed it to any of my family. If any doctor does and I know<br/>
it I would kill him as quick as I would for feeding arsnic<br/>
I do not employ such doctors to visit <span class=""unclear"">[me]</span>. I do not employ<br/>
any doctor to visit me.</p>

<p>The practice of doctors in visiting women<br/>
child birth is damnable. Women should be let alone<br/>
and let Nature have its perfect work. Let a woman keep<br/>
her child if she can two or three years but she cannot do<br/>
it. When the time has come Nature will deliver<br/>
her of her child without a doctor. Dont fret. Let<br/>
everything take it's proper course and sickness w<strike>ill</strike>ould depart<br/>
away.</p>

<p>The doctors in New Haven ^Ct.^ met by mutual<br/>
agreement to see how far they could frighten a man and did<br/>
actually frighten him to death, a robust hearty man.</p>

<p>Many things should be said to this<br/>
people. There has not been a doctor baptized into<br/>
this church that has the Holy Ghost but what will acknowledge<br/>
he is a fool. There is not a physician in the church or<br/>
in the world ^that is taught from on high by revelation^ but what will acknowledge this to be a true<br/>
doctrine: If there is a doctor who can see and know<br/>
man from head to foot and know how to care his diseases<br/>
by revelation such are the only true and safe doctors on earth<br/>
All other are fools.</p>",
42658.0,465,,"<p>I see <strike>medicine</strike> ^men die^ in the hands of the doctors. The medicines<br/>
kill them. Wdy dont they tell what ails th patient or acknowledge<br/>
they dont know. The factory there is among this class is disgraceful and<br/>
makes me mad and the day will come when you will not wonder at<br/>
my feelings</p>

<p>You are natural persons and God has made you<br/>
natural. If you are with child that child will come forth by<br/>
nature without a doctor. The earth is just so will bring<br/>
forth of itself seed after its kind.</p>

<p>If a person is sick and has not faith to be<br/>
healed give them herbs the products of the earth and it will care<br/>
you, until it is time to die.</p>

<p>When a cat is sick she will eat catnip without<br/>
a doctor, and she gets well. Nature prompts her to it<br/>
If a dog is bit with a rattlesnake he will dig a hole in the earth<br/>
and lie in the ground until the poison is gone. So nature<br/>
will teach us as well as the cat and dog. When a toad is bit<br/>
by a spider it will go and eat plantain if it can get it</p>

<p>If a child is to die in being born let<br/>
it die but dont employ a doctor to kill it. How will you<br/>
be instructed? I will tell you what to do. If  you are<br/>
taken sick dont be frightened but be calm. If you<br/>
get a cold let Nature be judge. Disease will go up and<br/>
down through the system to find a place to be located</p>

<p>It is as uch our duty to know how <br/>
to cure our system as to feed our body. The doctors would<br/>
say you are diseased but dont know it. Who made the<br/>
doctors? The Devil. The Lord did not make the<br/>
doctors of the present day</p>

<p>Such a thing as a man midwife <br/>
was not known until about the year 1500. Why did not<br/>
all the women di before this time? Look at the Indians<br/>
for one thousand years. Millions of children have been</p>",
42658.0,466,,"<p>born in the wilderness male and female and they live and not die<br/>
without a doctor.</p>

<p>You may ask what shall we do? I will<br/>
tell you. I will give you a lesson and I want you to<br/>
remember it. When you go to visit a woman in travel<br/>
let her alone until her full time has come. Remember<br/>
it and let the mother alone. Let your system be<br/>
natural. Teach them also to execise all they can<br/>
that when they come to be delivered it iwll be better<br/>
for them.</p>

<p>A doctor if he had good sense would<br/>
not wish to visit women in childbirth and if a woman<br/>
had good sense she would not wish a man to doctor<br/>
her on such an occasion</p>

<p>I want you to teach your<br/>
children the <strike>truth</strike> principle of birth.  I talk as I do<br/>
for the epeople will not sens anything unless they are<br/>
half knocked down or thunder rolls in their ears<br/>
soft words will not do. I want you to hear<br/>
and understand</p>

<p>There has been some difficulty in<br/>
this Board of Health. If I had been with you, you<br/>
would not have had any difficulty. It has been<br/>
through misunderstanding. If you understood<br/>
prinicple you would not quarrel. You may spread<br/>
culomel on your bread and butter and eat it if you<br/>
wish but it is as deadly poison as arsinic but not<br/>
as quick. It is not good. You may ask if<br/>
it was ever good in any case? There are cases<br/>
where it might be a benefit; but it would want a <br/>
revelation to tell when it was.</p>

<p>There is not poison in lobelia.<br/>
I will give 5000 dollars for the 16 part of an oz. of</p>",
42658.0,467,,"<p>poison that can be extraded out of all the lobelia in this Valley</p>

<p>It is not probable that any two persons are<br/>
organized just alike in all respects. Then who is a physician<br/>
None, unless he be taught of God and is a prophet or revelator<br/>
he cannot understand the human system know disease and<br/>
what will cure it.</p>

<p>I dont care how a man acts if he intends<br/>
to act right and when he acts wrong is willing to be righted</p>

<p>We will take the best physician of the day that<br/>
lives the closest to the Lord, I dont care how well he is<br/>
he will be brought down as a fool, for he will be made to<br/>
let God be honoured</p>

<p>I have been on a journey in the dust.<br/>
I have got dust on my brain: that is what ails me. It<br/>
will work off. Could a doctor tell what ails me? No.<br/>
Can a doctor tell what ails a sick man by feeling of his<br/>
pulse? No more than he could by feeling of a dogs tail <br/>
There is no Physician unless he is taught of God</p>

<p>You should learn how to doctor yourself<br/>
You should study your own system. Any people who<br/>
must trust to a doctor at all times will die. But trust<br/>
in God and you will live longer</p>

<p>What a different time it would be if all<br/>
trusted in God rather than in the doctors; for 9 out of<br/>
10 die under the doctors' cure who would live if they trusted<br/>
in God alone. Dont get frightened and and you will <br/>
do well enough. It is just as reasonable to send for a<br/>
doctor to have a calf colt or pig brought forth as it is<br/>
for a chlid</p>

<p>After you have received your resurrected<br/>
bodies you will bring for Spirits to all eternity who <br/>
will go to some world and take a tabernacle or body the<br/>
same as we have. You dont want a doctor anymore</p>",
42658.0,468,,"<p>here than there.</p>

<p>If the membrs of this socity are true either<br/>
male or female they will impart all teh useful knowledge they<br/>
hae to others. If they are not willing to do this they are<br/>
corrupt. If one man knows more than another let him tell<br/>
his knowledge and if a man knows more than all the rest let<br/>
him be a father unto the people and teach them and not act like<br/>
a boy. If I hold myself equal I am equal. If I listed<br/>
myself superior let me manifest it by doing a better deed and being<br/>
superior myself.</p>

<p>It is the man that rejects light and knowledge<br/>
when shown to him that God condemns and I condemn him<br/>
Some say we have spiritual wives but I think God has made<br/>
us all natural and I think we should be natural.""</p>

<p>President Young took for his <strike>test</strike>subject ""Sin and the forgiveness<br/>
of sin.""</p>

<p>""I speak upon this subject because we are in the<br/>
midst of it. It has been among all the elements; it has been<br/>
in our houses in our families and in our hearts and although<br/>
it has been our constant companion there are but few who<br/>
understand the nature of sin.</p>

<p>""Many have made themselves miserable<br/>
by thinking they had sinned against the Holy Ghost; others<br/>
that they had sinned a great sin. But what have the<br/>
revelations of the Lord said upon these subjects?</p>

<p>""We learn that Jesus Christ came and<br/>
took a body and redeemed the world but that Lucifer rebelled<br/>
and was ca<strike>m</strike>st down without any body and he has sought to<br/>
vex and destroy the children of men. He seeks<br/>
diligently to draw all from the right path especially if a <br/>
Saint tries to follow the track and get where Jesus was</p>",
42658.0,473,,"<p>then the Devil will try hard to overthrow them</p>

<p>Many have thought they have committed much<br/>
sin when they have not understood the nature and works of sin<br/>
We must understand many principles and arrive at much knowledge<br/>
before we can ^fully^ understand the nature of sin</p>

<p>The v<strike>ai</strike>eil of darkness is owver the earth so that<br/>
the inhabitants of the eart are so overwhelmed in tradition and<br/>
darkness they do not know light from darkness truth from error<br/>
right from wrong or the difference between the dictation of the<br/>
Holy Spirit or that conscience which has been framed for them<br/>
by the dictation of their mothers and Priests. Many think<br/>
far more of the traditions of their youth than of any principle<br/>
that God could reveal unto them. Their mother must not<br/>
do anything on Sunday. To darn a stocking would<br/>
be a great sin.</p>

<p>Sin is one thing and tradition another. The<br/>
word of God revealed will tell what sin is while tradition will<br/>
not.</p>

<p>The education of the world is good as far as they<br/>
have any truth found in science which they possess; but<br/>
they do not understand truth in connection with the plan<br/>
of salvation.</p>

<p>I want the Saints here to understand that<br/>
they cannot sin against God and Jesus Christ and the<br/>
Priesthood against <strike>his</strike> ^their^ gamilies and the Saints and then come<br/>
and ask forgiveness of the Church then pass on smoothly<br/>
and think they will go to heaven. This is too cheep a way<br/>
to get to heaven. I want this subject riveted on your<br/>
hearts; if it is not you will not remember it</p>

<p>You must remember your covenants and<br/>
the law of God that is given to us. It is written that sin<br/>
is a transgression of the law. Where is the law? In the<br/>
books that is given us in the main; yet this does not go into</p>",
42658.0,474,,"<p>all the meanderings of life. Where do you find a law that<br/>
you shall not drive a teem across your neighbours lot not go to<br/>
his hay stack or suffer your famlies to take liberties that<br/>
you are not willing should be done to you? Yet you know<br/>
it to be wrong. But do unto others as you wish others to<br/>
do unto you is the law and the Prophets.</p>

<p>Some men who have been ordained<br/>
unto the Priesthood and are very high in authority will take<br/>
the name of God in vain and swear by this and that.<br/>
Does such persons suppose that the Church can forgive that<br/>
sin? If you do your hope is in vain. They<br/>
can never forgive that sin? No man can do it. None<br/>
but God alone and it never will be forgiven until he does it.</p>

<p>The time will come that if a man will <br/>
take the name of God in vain he will be hewn down without<br/>
judgement or trial. Hear it O, ye Elders, for it is<br/>
time. Let this people sanctify their hearts, and then<br/>
take the name of God in vain and it will not be forgiven<br/>
The time will al[s]o come when the parents are sanctifyed<br/>
before the Lord and their children rise up in disobedience<br/>
against them and they will be hewn down.</p>

<p>If you sin against God and take<br/>
the name of God in vain if you get forgiveness you will<br/>
have to be forgiven by Him and not from man.</p>

<p>Some think if they are alone and sware<br/>
or sin nobody will know it; but they will find themselves<br/>
mistaken. Still if a man has to sware let him<br/>
be alone. If a man damns himslef let him be alone<br/>
that others may not be propheted by his sin.</p>

<p>If you take the name of God in<br/>
vain I will not forgive it, for I cannot. If the Lord<br/>
will forgive you will forgive you for maring my feelings<br/>
by speaking in my ears</p>",
42658.0,475,,"<p>The more you see the veil parted and the more ^you^ <strike>we</strike><br/>
learn the more you will see that God's ways or not as our ways<br/>
This people are passing through a great school of experience. I remember<br/>
while in Kirtland that if any of the brethren felt their rights infringed<br/>
upon in anywise or abused they would retaliate and be ready<br/>
to quarrel about it and get up a lawsuit for a debt of three dollars<br/>
But the minds of Saints have become more noble</p>

<p>Now if a man is abused who understands<br/>
principle he is above quarrelling about it and he feels to say<br/>
it is nothing to me: I am not to suffer by it; but you who<br/>
have abused me have the penatly to pay. But if the devil<br/>
can only make you think that you are abused or illtreated<br/>
and you begin to fret about it and you give the devil power<br/>
over you in the end it is an bad as though you had done<br/>
wrong yourself.</p>

<p>Now if a man sins against you until<br/>
seventy times seven and he repents and with an humble<br/>
heart asks forgiveness you should forgive him for this is<br/>
the law. He must ask forgiveness and be honourable<br/>
or he cannot be forgiven</p>

<p>As much as been said, and many<br/>
fears entertained concerning the sin against the Holy Ghost<br/>
I wish to speak farther concerning that subject. To<br/>
sin against the Holy Ghost is a sin against God the Father<br/>
the Son and the Holy Ghost that bears<strike>eth</strike> <strike>witness</strike> record of them<br/>
A man cannot sin against the Holy Ghost until the<br/>
Holy Ghost has revealled unto him the Father and the Son<br/>
and a knowledge of eternal things in a great degree. When<br/>
he has a knowledge of these things and with his eye open<br/>
he rebels against God and defys his power, he sins against<br/>
all three. If a man does sin against the Holy <br/>
Ghost the people have nothing to do with it; for they<br/>
cannot forgive that sin and none but God can do it, and</p>",
42658.0,476,,"<p>probably he will not in this world nor in the world to come for<br/>
they become sons of pedition and probably will never repent of nor<br/>
have a disposition to.</p>

<p>If you blaspheme the name of God dont<br/>
ask this people to forgive you. ^for they cannot do it &amp;c out^<br/>
If God forgives the sin then<br/>
you can go down into the waters of baptism. When you get<br/>
knowledge you will be ashamed to sin</p>

<p>Now I want to bring this subject home<br/>
What are the acts of the people? Do they not sin and trespass<br/>
against their brethren, parents against their children and children<br/>
against their parents, the husband against the wife and the wife <br/>
against the husband? This is with us and this we can reach<br/>
and manage and tell what ought to be done.</p>

<p>You ought to cease from taking the<br/>
liberty of any person and do unto all as you would wish them<br/>
to do unto you. Infringe upon the rights of no one; borrow<br/>
no tool but what you will return according to promise. Take<br/>
no wood nor anything else but what belongs to you and if<br/>
you find anything that is not your own do not hide it<br/>
away but report it that the owner may be found</p>

<p>If I had some stones here I could<br/>
cast them and his two or three in this congregation in the<br/>
head who are guilty of these acts. You may say why<br/>
dont you tell who they are? Why you poor devil are<br/>
you not going to repent of it by and bye? If not when<br/>
the day of clensing and sanctifying of Israel comes you<br/>
will have to be sacrificed and your blood spilt upon<br/>
the ground; for the day will come when iniquity must<br/>
cease in Zion and the profane man who takes the name<br/>
of God in vain will be slain.</p>

<p>In the days of ancient Israel Justice<br/>
was dealt out in a manner that showed they understood<br/>
principle and revered the commands of God.</p>",
42658.0,477,,"<p>It was a mercy to many to have justice and<br/>
judgement executed upon them on the earth even to be stain and have<br/>
their blood poured out upon the earth that it might be tolerable<br/>
for them.</p>

<p>God made a covenant with [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] and his seed<br/>
that he would save them. When they committed sin he<br/>
slew them that he might save them by their <strike>sprinkling</strike> ^spilling^ their<br/>
blood as an offering. Glad they had lived in sin they might<br/>
have sinned so as not to have been forgiven or saved. It<br/>
was a mercy to slay them</p>

<p>Now brethren if you sin against God<br/>
go to God to get forgiveness if that sin is not unto death. There<br/>
is a sin unto death which we are told we need not pray for.<br/>
If you sin against your brother go to him to get forgiveness<br/>
Ask forgiveness at the hands of the innocent. If you <br/>
sin against your family your parents your husband<br/>
your wife your child seek forgiveness at their hands; <br/>
but what is done in secret should be forgiven in secret<br/>
and go no further that sins may be hid. But if<br/>
sins are committed openly they should ask forgiveness<br/>
and be forgiven openly. These are true principles<br/>
and let them be remembered forever</p>

<p><u>Goverenor [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]] Address</u><br/>
<u>On Slavery</u></p>

<p><u>Before</u> <u>the</u> <u>Legislative</u> <u>Assembly</u> <u>of</u> <u>Utah</u></p>

<p>The whole world are slaves. Eve partook of<br/>
the forbidden fruit and also [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] and this act<br/>
brought slavery upon all their posterity in some way or</p>",
42658.0,478,,"<p>other and this will continue in some way or other until we become<br/>
righteous enough to drive the devil and evil from the earth</p>

<p>[[Adam (OT)|Adam]] had two sons, [[Cain (OT)|Ca<strike>n</strike>in]] and<br/>
[[Abel (OT)|Abel]]. Cain was more given to evil than Abel. Adam<br/>
was called to offer sacrifice so also were his sons. The<br/>
sacrifice of Abel was more acceptable than Cain's and Cain<br/>
took it into his heart to put Abel out of the way so he<br/>
killed Abel</p>

<p>The Lord said I will not kill Cain<br/>
but I will put a mark upon him and it is seen in the<br/>
face of every Nigro<strike>l</strike>e on the earth and it is the decree of<br/>
God that that mark shall remain upon the seed of Cain<br/>
and the Curse until all the seed of Abel should be redeemed<br/>
and Cain will not recive the Priesthood or salvation until<br/>
all the seed of Abel are redeemed.</p>

<p>Any man having one drop of the seed<br/>
of Cain in him cannot hold the Priesthood and if no other <br/>
Prophet ever spake it before I will say it now in the name<br/>
of Jesus Christ. I know it is true and others know<br/>
it.</p>

<p>The Nero<strike>e</strike> cannot hold one particle of government<br/>
but the day will come when all the seed of Cain will be<br/>
redeemed and have all the blessings we have now and a great<br/>
deal more but the seed of Abel will be ahe<strike>i</strike>ad of the<br/>
seed of Cain to all eternity.</p>

<p>Let me consent to day to mingle my<br/>
seed with the seed of Cain and it will bring the same<br/>
curse upon me and it would upon any mean; and if<br/>
any man mingle his seed with the seed of Cain the<br/>
only way he could get rid of it or have salvation would<br/>
be to come forward and hae his head cut off and spill<br/>
his blood upon the ground and it would also take the<br/>
life of his children</p>",
42658.0,479,,"<p>It is said that if a man <strike>takes</strike> ^kills^ another he takes<br/>
that which he cannot give. If a man's head is cut off his life is<br/>
not destroyed nor his Spirit. That lives. His tabernacle is<br/>
destroyed. But I can make as good tabernacls as I can<br/>
destroy. If you will not believe it look at my children</p>

<p>Much blood was shed in ancient times<br/>
both of man and beast. The firstlings and best of the <br/>
flock was sacrificed on the Altar; and in some instances<br/>
many men and almost whole nations were sacrificed or put<br/>
to death because of their sins and wickedness. This was the<br/>
only way they could be saved at all.</p>

<p>If Jesus Christ had not had his blood<br/>
shed the blood that he received from his mother [[Mary (NT)|Mary]]<br/>
the world would not have been saved.</p>

<p>There is not one of the seed of old<br/>
[[Cain (OT)|Cain]] that is permitted to rule the reign over the seed of<br/>
[[Abel (OT)|Abel]] and neither you nor I can help it.</p>

<p>Those that do bear rule should do it in<br/>
righteousness. I am opposed to the present system of<br/>
slavery. The [[Negro|Negro]] should serve the seed of <br/>
[[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] but it should be done right. Dont abuse<br/>
the Negro and treat him cruel.</p>

<p>It has been argued here that many<br/>
of the Jews were [[Black|black]]. Whenever the seed of [[Judah (OT)|Judah]]<br/>
mingled with the seed Cain they lost the Priesthood and<br/>
all their blessings.</p>

<p>As an example; let the Presidency Twelve<br/>
Seventies High Priests Bishops and all the authorities say<br/>
Now we will all go and mingle with the seed of Cain<br/>
and they may have all the privelegies they want; and<br/>
we lift our hands to heaven in support of this.<br/>
That moment we lose the Priesthood and all its blessings<br/>
and we should not be redeemed until Cain was. I</p>",
42658.0,480,1852-02-08,"<p>will never admit of it for a moment. Some may think I dont<br/>
know as much as they do; but I know that I <strike>do</strike> ^know^ more than they.</p>

<p>The Lord will watch us all the time<br/>
The Devil would like ot rule part of the time but I am determined<br/>
he shall not rule at all; and [[Negroes|Negros]] shall not rule us, I<br/>
will not consent for the seed of [[Cain (OT)|Cain]] to vote for me or my<br/>
brethren. If you want to know why we did not<br/>
speak of this in the Constitution it was because it was none<br/>
of their business.</p>

<p>Any man is a citizen [[Black|black]] white or red<br/>
and if the Jews come here with a part of the Canaanite blood<br/>
in them they are citizens and shall have their rights but<br/>
not to rule for me or my brethren.</p>

<p>Those persons from the Islands and<br/>
foreign countries know nothing about governing the people<br/>
The Canaanite cannot have wisdom to do things as the<br/>
white man has.</p>

<p>We must quarrel against all evil. I am<br/>
not going to let this people damn themselves as long as<br/>
I can help it""</p>

<p>I trust in the Lord for light as I have heretofore done<br/>
When the minds of men are open to understand they will see things<br/>
as they are. We are subject to all the evils which there are<br/>
in the world.</p>

<p>I have thought this world as fallen as any of</p>",
42658.0,481,,"<p>the creation of God. When the Lord created the earth or any world<br/>
if they leave an exaltation they will have to experience all that we<br/>
experience. I see no reason why they should not be tempted<br/>
as we are tempted. If we are candidates for exaltation and<br/>
glory and we cannot get that exaltation and glory in any other way<br/>
then we should be reconciled to it and be satisfied to let the<br/>
Lord do with us as he pleases</p>

<p>Is there any evil upon any person or<br/>
affliction upon any nation or Kingdom that God does not permit?<br/>
There is not. We should then be faithful to God in all things<br/>
<strike>to be his secret counsellor. If necessary</strike> Why should we complain<br/>
or find fault with God about anything? We should not. See<br/>
the example of the nations of the earth. They complain<br/>
about everything and against all this Providences. There is<br/>
no proceeding of ours of act or experience but what he knows<br/>
all about</p>

<p>If it would be any satisfaction to you<br/>
I would say that God has passed through all the trails and<br/>
experience that we have. Jesus Christ has passed through<br/>
all the trials and experience the same as we. It would not<br/>
be prudent to say that the Father has not the same<br/>
experience that his Son has. He had quite as much<br/>
as his Son.</p>

<p>Let the Saints look about themselves and<br/>
see if they have as great things as they expected. When<br/>
they first received the Gospel and the Holy Ghost opened<br/>
their minds they saw that Zion was to be built up and<br/>
Israel gathered, the power of God and the Holy Ghost<br/>
to be poured out upon us. ""If we could get a place by<br/>
ourselves how faithful we would live and thank God."" Do<br/>
you have the same things that you looked for? Will<br/>
I dont know you say. This shows that somebody<br/>
has let down their watch and influenced others and they</p>",
42658.0,482,,"<p>have not lived up to their privileges</p>

<p>When we first received the Gospel we were<br/>
humble but since then the Tempter has come and we are tempted<br/>
with many things. But this is right. The Lord permits<br/>
it. We could not get glory without it.</p>

<p>Let me ask if any one is here who<br/>
went to Jackson County in 1831? The feeling was if I could<br/>
get with the Saints all y sorrow and trouble will be at an end<br/>
So it is with the Saints in England. Before we preached the <br/>
gathering to them the Lord revealed <strike>it</strike> to them that they would be<br/>
gathered. We told them not to reveal it till the time came</p>

<p>Do you have anything now that you looked<br/>
for in the beginning. If not something is the matter. You<br/>
don't do right. You dont settle this difficulty or that. But<br/>
what is the matter? You are wrong yourself. What<br/>
hinders you from praying all day or having fasting and <br/>
prayer? You have enough to eat; but the great<br/>
difficulty is when they moved to Zion they broght themselves<br/>
with them.</p>

<p>You had so many devil in you that<br/>
they trouble you. When the devil and wicked men<br/>
have afflicted and persecuted us as far as was for our<br/>
good then the Lord says stop and go no farther. But<br/>
if we take everything patiently all our afflictions will work<br/>
together for our good. But do you at the present<br/>
time have anything to mar your peace except what you<br/>
bring upon yourselves. You have privileges here but<br/>
do the people prize their privileges?</p>

<p>Why do the people go to teh Kanyons<br/>
after wood on Sunday? Why have they gone to day?<br/>
Why dont I do it? Why do I not visit my farm<br/>
or the bath house on Sunday? Because it is not right<br/>
and sets a bad example. I cannot do these things<br/>
</p>",
42658.0,483,,"<p>on the Sabbath</p>

<p>Some will take poles from his neighbours fence or<br/>
take a chain or an axe without liberty. This is wrong. There<br/>
is nothing on earth to mar our peace but our own acts. But<br/>
the great difficulty is we cannot get away from ourselves. Some<br/>
think perhaps that if they go to the Gold digings they can get<br/>
away from themselves but they cannot</p>

<p>When persecution and trials come they scord<br/>
the good seed and it dries up.</p>

<p>How are you going to get Zion. Nothing<br/>
hinders our having Zions but ourselves. We have all the<br/>
priveleges of angerls to worship God and get all blessings we<br/>
need.</p>

<p>We have to war with all devils temptations and<br/>
trials until we overcome. I will fight until I overcome<br/>
If I fall into the grave there are others who will take my<br/>
place. There are many who will fight and if needs<br/>
to will take the Sword</p>

<p>I hope all who want good principles will<br/>
hae the privilege of receiving them To day is a day of<br/>
tithing and sacrafice; to morrow comething the burning.</p>

<p>I would say that you cannot be<br/>
perfect without me nor I without you. The Providences<br/>
of God have so interwoven and identified the interest of the<br/>
children of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] together that they cannot be perfect<br/>
without each other.</p>

<p>Do you enjoy yourselves and have peace. I<br/>
have peace and no man can take it from me. If you do<br/>
not have peace and no man can take it from me. If you do<br/>
not have peace it is because you drive stakes and the Lord<br/>
will not let you do it.</p>

<p>But let the will of God be done. If<br/>
you dont enjoy Zion it is because you dont say ""Let the<br/>
will of God be done. There is nothing to take your Zion</p>",
42658.0,484,,"<p>away but yourselves.</p>

<p>We are to be tried and tempted in every way in order<br/>
to prove ourselves the friend of God in all things and God will bless you<br/>
My prayer is that God may bless this people and that they may be<br/>
faithful and the friends of God.</p>

<p>I told the Legislature that I should<br/>
be proud to have the world know that I told the Assembly to<br/>
fast and pray until they got the Spirit of God to do their duty<br/>
I would like to see the judges upon the Bench to ask God to<br/>
bless them and all the Jury and witnesses to assist them in all<br/>
their testimony and decisions.""</p>

<p>On the 1st of March I was 45 years<br/>
of age.</p>

<p>On the 4th the [[Brigham Young|Governor]] President of the Council<br/>
Speaker of the House with all the members of both branches<br/>
of the Legislature assembled who their ladies at the Council<br/>
House and partook of an excellent feast. The Governor<br/>
gave an interesting address in the evening which closed<br/>
with the shout of hosannah.</p>

<p>Two days later and the Legislative<br/>
Assembly adjourned until the next December and the<br/>
Governor blessed the Assembly.</p>

<p>-[On the 1st of April I attended a party<br/>
at the Bath House. About 51 gentlement and 100 ladies<br/>
were present. I addressed the Assembly at 8 o'clock in the evening<br/>
and returned home. The Presidency and Twelve and those<br/>
who had been at work in the Council House assisting in the<br/>
endowments were washed and anoited. I did not get<br/>
word of it and was not present.]-</p>

<p>This evening the mail arrived which <br/>
had been anxiously looked for during man weeks. From it<br/>
we gathered American and European news and found that there</p>",
42658.0,485,1852-04-06,"<p>were warm times in Congress in consequence of the Utah Judges<br/>
having gone home and made reports against Governor [[Brigham Young|Young]] and others.</p>

<p><u>General Conference.</u><br/>
<u>of</u><br/>
<u>The Church</u> <u>of Jesus</u> <u>Christ</u> <u>of Latter</u>-day Saints<br/>
<u>held</u><br/>
In the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]]<br/>
<time datetime=""",04/06/1852
42658.0,485,,"""><u>April 6 1852</u></time></p>

<p>There were present Brigham Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] and<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] of the First Presidency; and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
Wilford Woodruff and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] of the quorum of the<br/>
Twelve. Also Patriarchs [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] and [[Isaac Morley|Isaac Morley]],<br/>
[[Daniel Spencer|Daniel Spencer]] President of the Stake the Presidents of the several guorums and a congregation that filled the Tabernacle<br/>
to overflowing. Hundreds could not get into the house.</p>

<p>The President took the Stand at 10 o'clock<br/>
and said</p>

<p>""We adjourned last conference to meet in the<br/>
Tabernacle to day. We are here in the New Tabernacle<br/>
according to appointment.""</p>

<p>The hymn was then sung — ""Lord in<br/>
the morning thou shalt hear""</p>

<p>The dedication prayer was offered up<br/>
by Willard Richards and is published in the Deseret News<br/>
President Young arose and said</p>

<p>I arise to say a few words, as we <br/>
have offered the ""Dedication Prayer"", upon that subject</p>

<p>Who could foresee the way of the Lord</p>",
42658.0,486,,"<p><time datetime=""1852-04""><u>April</u>: <u>1852.</u></time></p>

<p>as we now see it? We can now behold the manifestation<br/>
of the Lord. He has done what we could not but we<br/>
hae an experience that teaches us to trust in the Lord</p>

<p>We should not undertake to dictate the<br/>
Lord for his work will go on. We have seen plenty<br/>
try to dictate the Lord and tr<strike>a</strike>y to build up themselves<br/>
and not this kingdom; but they soon fall and the Lord<br/>
overthrows them; but this work goes on the Gospel is<br/>
preached and all his work rolls forth</p>

<p>Let the wicked do what they please:<br/>
we have the privelege of worshiping God and being happy<br/>
I wish to dedicate all I possess unto God and praise him<br/>
and do all he requires of me</p>

<p>At the last Conference I was sick<br/>
and not able to be with you — not able to be up. I<br/>
meditated upon the State of the Church. I saw some<br/>
going to the right and some to the left: some after gold and<br/>
the riches of this life. I said I would tell the brethren<br/>
my feelings. I said I would go to work and build a<br/>
tabernacle and worship the Lord so that we would not<br/>
be driven home by a storm. I saw also that some<br/>
would say I cannot go for I must take care of my<br/>
cattle my farm my fields &amp;c; but I said I would go and<br/>
worship God as long as I wished if the whole earth sunk</p>

<p>Some delight in a fine horse farm<br/>
or house or good things of this life; but this is nothing to<br/>
you. It is good in its place. But you cannot<br/>
pray because you cannot spend time.</p>

<p>Some women cannot spend time to<br/>
have prayers. You know it is your duty to pray and<br/>
dedicate yourselves to God and your family and all you<br/>
possess</p>

<p>Some feel as though they must go to</p>",
42658.0,487,,"<p><time datetime=""1852-04""><u>April</u> <u>1852.</u></time></p>

<p>night to the Kanyons;but if you will hearken to counsel you will <br/>
say to all the world stand by: I am going to worship the Lord. Let<br/>
the dead bury the dead; but I will dedicate myself and <strike>aff</strike> family<br/>
and all I hae unto the Lord. No matter what the Lord<br/>
sets you about go at it and do it</p>

<p>There is a great change with this people<br/>
We have been sick; now are we well: We have been poor, now<br/>
are we rich, — have been distressed and mobed now we have peace.<br/>
How long will it last? As long as this people do right.</p>

<p>It ha<strike>v</strike>s been 22 years since this Church<br/>
was organized. We should serve the Lord, love the Lord<br/>
with all our hearts cease to do wrong or find fault with any<br/>
of the Saints. If they do wrong chastise them and not<br/>
hate them.</p>

<p>Are the people prepared to make a covenant<br/>
to dedicate themselves and their hearts to God from this hour?<br/>
I feel to urge all the brethren and sisters to dedicate themselves<br/>
unto the Lord.</p>

<p>If we can gain the victory and say I will<br/>
do the work of the Lord in all things; if he will make<br/>
his will known I will perform it. Not only say but<br/>
perform it and dedicate our affections unto the Lord.</p>

<p>We may find some that cannot do this<br/>
They say I want some gold or something to help myself<br/>
with to get out of difficulties. What will be done in<br/>
such a case? I will tell you what I would do.<br/>
If I had got but one cow and she plaqued me I would<br/>
give her away. If you have anything that is in your <br/>
way give it to the public works</p>

<p>Let nothing get between you and God<br/>
and I will tell you what to do. If anything gets<br/>
between you and God give it to his service or you<br/>
cannot get through the gates of the celestial city.</p>",
42658.0,488,,"<p>Why are you not as <strike>poor</strike> ^pure^ an the Church of Enoch?<br/>
Because you have not the mind to be. I will make my<br/>
hands do the will of God and my heart will go with it. The<br/>
spirit of envy will not obey. Then unite your interest<br/>
with this kingdom for this kingdom will stand forever.<br/>
Put your interest with it so that you cannot get away and<br/>
then you will stick to the kingdom; but if your purse<br/>
of gold is in your pocket and you apostatize you may<br/>
go away but if your interest is with the church and you<br/>
do wrong you may stay until you get the Spirit of<br/>
God again and may be saved</p>

<p>We must build up this kingdom first<br/>
and dont be afraid of storming for this kingdom will be<br/>
an everlasting kingdom that will not be thrown down<br/>
It will stand forever. The more the wicked try to<br/>
throw it down the more it wills tand. If you<br/>
want it to stand unite your interest with it in such<br/>
a manner that you cannot get it away. Then you are<br/>
safe.</p>

<p>If I was to ask what was your opinion<br/>
concerning the Millinnium I should get a great many<br/>
opinions; but the truth is all will be in one sense as it is<br/>
now. You will eat built and do all things as now<br/>
only you will be more pure and untied and all will serve<br/>
the Lord and not the devil any more. Let this people<br/>
possess this spirit and here would be the Millinnuim<br/>
as it would be with any people who will do this.""</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] closed with blessing the<br/>
people and after singing and prayer the meeting [a]djourned</p>

<p>In the afternoon the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] was<br/>
crowded to excess. [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and [[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]]<br/>
delivered discourses.</p>

<p>Next morning the Tabernacle was</p>",
42658.0,489,,"<p>at an early hour filled to overflowing and in the morning of this day's<br/>
Conference the authorities of the church were presented. Among<br/>
the rest [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] moved that [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] be the Governor<br/>
of the State of Deseret which was carried unaminously; and<br/>
that Heber C. Kimball be the Lieut. Governor which was<br/>
sustained with applause.</p>

<p>President Young remarked that ""no doubt<br/>
before you get home you will hear we have committed treason</p>

<p>""With regard to the labour of this [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]]<br/>
I will say the cost will be read before the meeting and all the<br/>
tithing and outlay; but you feel that your expectations<br/>
are realized you should be satisfied.</p>

<p>I will say I never saw any room as<br/>
convenient as this. It will seat 2,200 persons and these<br/>
<strike>is</strike> are 2,500 persons here to day. I expect the Tabernacle<br/>
that we intend to build on this block will seat 15000<br/>
people. We never did build a house large enough to<br/>
hold the people. If we were to enclose this whole 10<br/>
acre block so that it would hold two hundred thousand<br/>
people by the time we go it done there would be enough<br/>
to fill it.</p>

<p>""The Lord is controling our affairs and does<br/>
more for us than we can do for ourselves or ask him to do for<br/>
us. The momre we are humble and will labour and<br/>
prepare for the gathering of Israel the faster they will gather.</p>

<p>""The establishment of this Tabernacle was<br/>
the result of my meditation while on a sick bed.</p>

<p>""I feel as usual to praise the Lord with all my <br/>
heart. The hand of God has been as visible in leading<br/>
this people as it was in leading Israel in teh days of [[Moses (OT)|Moses]]<br/>
Some had not faith to come on for fear of starving to death.</p>",

<p>Brother [[John Kempton|Kempton]] spoke for a few moments and then<br/>
again President [[Brigham Young|Young]] spoke and observed</p>

<p>""The Gentiles will take exception to what is<br/>
said here. I know as the Lord lives that the people of<br/>
the United States have departed from the Spirit and letter of their<br/>
Constitution and this people will be the only people who will<br/>
sustain it""</p>

<p>[[William Wines Phelps|W<u>m</u> W. Phelps]] in an address remarked<br/>
that this was the third time he had been to a ""dedication<br/>
of a house built to worship God in. He was at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]<br/>
when the angel of the Lord came in and sat there during<br/>
service.</p>

<p>""In the afternoon the manifesto of the<br/>
recepts and expenditures of the tithing from <time datetime=""1848-10"">Oct 1848</time> to<br/>
<time datetime=""",03/27/1852
42658.0,490,,""">March 27th 1852</time> was laid before the Conference. The<br/>
sum total of the numerous items stood as follows:</p>

<p>Total of all $353,765.69<br/>
Yet to be accounted for 36,495 12<br/>
Property on hand 75,550 04</p>

<p>President Young remarked<br/>
""For my own satisfaction and great<br/>
consalation there has not one dollar gone into the hands of a<br/>
lawyer as in the days of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] At that time almost<br/>
every dollar had to go into the hands of lawyers and they<br/>
pro^se^cuted him all the day long. But I said I<br/>
would kill any man who sought to take me.</p>

<p>Many thought my purse reached<br/>
from eternity to eternity — that there was no end to it<br/>
We were called ""bogus makers."" Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
said we would go where we could coin the pure gold<br/>
$10 at a lick. We have done so even $20 at a<br/>
time.</p>",
42658.0,491,,"<p><time datetime=""1852-04""><u>April</u> <u>1852</u></time></p>

<p>Our brethren went to [[California|Calafornia]]. The hand of God<br/>
was in all this. They opened the gold mines and the Lord<br/>
had a design in it to see who would be tried by it. Never<br/>
did nor ever will any of the Saints go to dig gold there without<br/>
being sent without being damned by it. Mark my words.<br/>
If we go on to the devils ground we shall be left to smell<br/>
hell: we shall feel the wrath of God. If [[Brigham Young|I]] was sent there<br/>
by the Lord I would go but the Lord has not called me<br/>
to go. Many Elders in Israel some good men<br/>
have tried it and smutted themselves up so that it is<br/>
quite a question if they will ever be washed clean</p>

<p>I have said I did not think that there<br/>
was one dollar in 20 paid in tithing that had been spent<br/>
on the Public Works but it seems from the Books that there<br/>
has been about one fourth. The other 3 fourths I <br/>
have had to borrow. If I had to borrow all the monies<br/>
that is used and none assist me to pay it, it will make my<br/>
head ache</p>

<p>I have trusted the Lord and served<br/>
him all the day long and when I undertake anything I <br/>
persevere until I accomplish it. I see the difference<br/>
in trusting in God and doing business according to the<br/>
order of the world.</p>

<p>There is not one hair droped from<br/>
my head unnoticed and does God not know what I want</p>

<p>There never was a miracle only to the ignorant<br/>
It is all to be accounted for on natural principles. The<br/>
Lord will not turn <strike>w</strike>a stone and clay into gold to suit me<br/>
There is enough without it. Jesus did not make<br/>
bread out of a stone; but he had knowledge and power<br/>
and did call together the elements to make bread and<br/>
the elements into the water to make wine. ^out^ But<br/>
the Lord is not going to work a miracle to clothe us</p>",
42658.0,492,,"<p>Raise your wool and flax and spin and weave it and make it up<br/>
and not have to pay cash for every pound you use. What you<br/>
buy is hardly worth making up but what you make is strong<br/>
and will wear.""</p>

<p>In the evening the Priesthood filled the<br/>
[[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] at an early hour and was addressed by President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]. He arose and said:</p>

<p>""This is certainly a mixed congregation<br/>
of all the officers of the Church. We are to be instructed<br/>
in all things. The knowledge that is now in the midst of<br/>
this people is more than in all the world besides. All<br/>
science is in the midst of this people even if they have not learned<br/>
it as the world has.</p>

<p>I have my cagitations and views of the<br/>
affairs of this Kingdom; but I have learned that we must<br/>
work to the scribe if not we may fail in it; but if we<br/>
work in faith and confidence the Lord is apt to help us</p>

<p>I asked a favour of the Bishops to<br/>
divide the money debts in each ward that it might be paid</p>

<p>Let us contend with ourselves and dicipline<br/>
ourselves until everything within us is brought into subjection<br/>
to the law of Christ. You have been taught the first<br/>
principles of the Gospel now teach yourselves and the Church</p>

<p>Our school is the School of the Prophets<br/>
This is a school to paline and polish ourselves. And<br/>
suppose under such privilege we should indulge in evil<br/>
and neglect our families and our duty to God? All<br/>
our former sins would be upon our Heads.</p>

<p>It is for a man to commit himself<br/>
and all that he presides over unto God to do his will <br/>
and to continue to do it until he is santified</p>

<p>If your neighbour does you evil, do<br/>
not do evil to him. Bear with him and set him</p>",
42658.0,493,,"<p>right but dont quarrel with him; but be careful that you conduct yourself<br/>
well until you are prepared for the society of holy men</p>

<p>This is as I said the school of the Prophets<br/>
Our baptism is only the beginning of our work. You must<br/>
then go on the perfection. You must perform this work. Our<br/>
children understand the Gospel but do they understand the way<br/>
to govern their lives? We shall never see a day but what <br/>
we can learn. We shall not inherit the glory of God all<br/>
at once or understand all knowledge; but God teaches us<br/>
small principles to prepare us for greater ones.</p>

<p>Let us learn in this school. There aer<br/>
a great many books of education of the present day. The main<br/>
branch of our study is theology. I understand it better than<br/>
any in the world. [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] [[Enoch (OT)|Enoch]] [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] [[Aaron (OT)|Aaron]] Jesus<br/>
and the Apostles have all been in the same school in their day<br/>
and have faithfully learned that they might be perfected. They<br/>
are my brethren and will be my company; and I now tell<br/>
you if you want me to have full fellowship with you cease<br/>
speaking evil of God and all good men whether in heaven<br/>
or earth</p>

<p>When a man is in the right track he will<br/>
come and lay down anything at the feet of a brother to settle<br/>
a difficulty and rather wrong<strike> themselves</strike> himself than have a difficulty out</p>

<p>If you wanted revelation written diging gold<br/>
going to [[England|England]] or any other place. I profess to be an<br/>
Apostle. Every Apostle will have to be a revelator and<br/>
have revelations if there are thousands of them if they do their<br/>
duty and live up to their calling if not they will have to be<br/>
removed. But a man who is not an Apostle has<br/>
not power to stand at the head of the Kingdom of God,<br/>
hold the Keys of the Priesthood and build up and lead<br/>
the Church of God. The highest authority on the earth</p>",
42658.0,494,,"<p>is our Apostle.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ will have a class of men who will do all<br/>
that he requires of them. They will have the greater flory; but<br/>
those who cannot endure will have a lesser glory.""</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] delivered a discourse after the<br/>
president had closed.</p>

<p>Next day the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] was filled at 9 o'clock<br/>
and the meeting opened by prayer from Elder Wilford Woodruff who<br/>
then addressed the assembly. He was followed by [[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] Judge [[Zerubbabel Snow|Z. Snow]] and [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] and then President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] made the following remarks</p>

<p>""The subject I am at is to enlighten<br/>
the mind. It is expected we have to learn letters<br/>
With regard to the principle of education it commences<br/>
with the mother. I do not like to see mothers<br/>
attend to everything else but their children. They should<br/>
teach their children all they can for early impassions<br/>
will last persons during their lives whether they be <br/>
good or bad. I will tell  you the truth as it is<br/>
in eternity. If the child does not have good<br/>
instruction in early life it will be requird at the hand<br/>
of the mother and not at the hand of the father</p>

<p>The child will think the mother is<br/>
the best woman on earth and the mother has power to <br/>
instill into the mind of the child what she please and what<br/>
she imparts unto ^it^ <strike>them</strike> will stay with <strike>them</strike> ^it^ through life</p>

<p>Mothers should take care of their children<br/>
and not spend their time watching their husbands. It is<br/>
the duty of mothers to stay at home and take care of<br/>
their children. My duty calls me to be in the stand<br/>
I know not what my children are about or what they<br/>
are doing. They may be in the street swearing for<br/>
what I know as others do. If they should go to hell</p>",
42658.0,495,,"<p>it would be required at the hands of the mother and not at my hands<br/>
A child of mine shall not conquer me. [[Brigham Young|I]] would sooner see them<br/>
die than that they should conquer me. If any one of my<br/>
children will not follow my footsteps I will disinherit or disown<br/>
them. They shall not have part in my kingdom. I <br/>
would rather get children adopted to me who would keep the<br/>
commandments.</p>

<p>No child should rise up and teach and control<br/>
the mother; nor should woman rise up and dictate the<br/>
husband and the husband should not rise up and try to dictate<br/>
his president or the Lord.</p>

<p>Education begins with the mother to the<br/>
child. You must keep it in remembrance that the Lord<br/>
has commanded you to multiply and replenish the earth<br/>
that you may have joy and rejoicing in the day of the holy<br/>
resurrection.</p>

<p>Do you keep your minds pure and do<br/>
you pray night and day. Now pray from the time of<br/>
conception till the time of delivery that your child may be<br/>
filled with the Holy Ghost and that a noble spirit from eternity<br/>
may come into the Tabernacle and that the Holy Ghost may<br/>
rest upon the father mother and child.</p>

<p>When some speak you cannot understand<br/>
they make use of such high flown words; but when I speak<br/>
you can understand the verity in the English language</p>

<p>I would like to be with the Holy Ones who <br/>
are full of eternal light. A point of the finger or emotion <br/>
would communicate without words. When I am full of<br/>
the Holy Ghost I can see a man as well behind as<br/>
before. I can see their hearts by the Spirit of<br/>
God and know what is in them.""</p>

<p>In the afternoon one hundred were<br/>
called for to go with their teams to meet the emigrants</p>",
42658.0,496,,"<p>and some were appointed to go on foreign missions:</p>

<p>The Seventies held a meeting at night<br/>
on the subject of building the Seventies Hall, and they were<br/>
addressed by Joseph Young [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] Wilford<br/>
Woodruff and others.</p>

<p><u>Synopsis of An Address</u><br/>
<u>by</u><br/>
<u>President</u> <u>Young</u><br/>
<u>April</u> <u>the</u> <u>9th.</u></p>

<p>""This people are blessed with all that heart can with and<br/>
yet many are not satisfied. This is the case with some<br/>
spirits and they want things illegally.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that we should have<br/>
a Temple. It is absolutely necessary that we should have<br/>
a Temple to worship the Most High God in. A Tabernacle<br/>
is to assemble the multitude for meeting but a Temple is to<br/>
gather the Priesthood in that they may do the work of the Lord</p>

<p>Are we prepared to go and redeem our<br/>
dead? Is there a place prepared that we may go and<br/>
redeem our dead? No there is not. We give endowments<br/>
here but it is like trying to step on to the top round first</p>

<p>If we had the privelege of building<br/>
a temple our works would not be legal but we do these things<br/>
until we have time to build a temple. If we had gone on<br/>
to the top of the mountains if we had no room it would be <br/>
legal and right</p>",
42658.0,497,,"<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] says we have to make our own<br/>
heaven. The Lord cannot save us if we do not save ourselves. If<br/>
we expect to get our endowments we have got to follow the footsteps<br/>
that God has set for us to walk in and if we walk in that channel<br/>
God owns our labours and acknowledges all that is done.</p>

<p>Now all the ordinances will have to be attended to<br/>
again when we get a Temple. Yet if any one dies in faith those<br/>
ordinances will be legal; but all that live will have to do it again<br/>
and [[Brigham Young|I]] will say as a revelation that if you will not help build a <br/>
Temple and have faith in the work you will be lost.</p>

<p>A word to those who have got their endowments<br/>
We shall work as fast as we can and what we have done is<br/>
legal. If we had been in our own lands and had a right to<br/>
a temple we should not do as we now do.</p>

<p>Many have died in the faith, have been<br/>
worn out: their ordinances are legal. Those who came into<br/>
the church first and are faithful have a right to the ordinances<br/>
first.</p>

<p>I wish the people to understand that when the<br/>
Lord has anything for them they will have it; but when the<br/>
Lord has nothing for the people I don't want for them to teaze<br/>
me for what they cannot have. When there is to be a work<br/>
done I will tell you.</p>

<p>Now we shall begin to build a temple in <br/>
1853. This [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] will have to accomodate the <br/>
people until the Temple is built. If this wont answer for<br/>
the people until we build a Temple we will make a Bowery<br/>
on the North and South sides of the block.</p>

<p>At soon as the Temple is built we will<br/>
give you your endowments. If there are any who were in<br/>
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] and other places and have helped to build up<br/>
the Kindom of God in the early days we want to bless them<br/>
first; and if there is any man or child who went in the Battalion</p>",
42658.0,498,,"<p>or Pioneers come forward and get your blessings before others and<br/>
we will bless you. If you are faithful there is no blessing<br/>
in the celestial law or kingdom of God but what you will<br/>
get.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] want to be sealed to my [[John Hayden Young|father]] before I<br/>
shall be a legal heir. If I were to die and there was<br/>
not a child of mine to live to do it for me some friend<br/>
would be raised up to do it and if not my body will<br/>
soon be raise up and I should be in some Temple with<br/>
my brothren to tell them what to do</p>

<p>I can see the hearts of men and <br/>
the spirits of men. If they do try to be hid I can<br/>
see them. I see many who aspire to be first and<br/>
to be exalted above their fellows; but I can tell<br/>
you all you will be rewarded according to what you do<br/>
whether you do little or much or nothing at all.</p>

<p>Some wish to be above Brother<br/>
Brigham. Why was I not called before brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
Why does not some one ask the Lord to appoint them to<br/>
be above brother Brigham? But the Lord will laugh<br/>
at you. Such forget the Kingdom of God. The are corrupt.</p>

<p>Let every man say what can I do<br/>
to build up the Kingdom of God. Ask the mother who<br/>
is trying to do the will of God what her reward will be?<br/>
She will say I dont know but I will say if you are<br/>
faithful and satisfied with your condition in this life you<br/>
will be blessed and satisfied with your condition in the <br/>
world to come.</p>

<p>Let all strive to be satisfied with their<br/>
conditions in life and that will be a blessing to them.""</p>

<p>Other matters concerning paying our<br/>
debts &amp;c were touched upon by the President and then Elder<br/>
[[John Banks|John Banks]] followed in some interesting remarks.</p>",
42658.0,499,1852-04-11,"<p>After several others had spoken the meeting adjourned<br/>
In the afternoon of this day's conference President [[Brigham Young|Young]] delivered his<br/>
great discourse on [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] our Father and God. I recorded a synopsis<br/>
of it in my journal but a full report of it is published in the Journal<br/>
of Discourses Vol I.</p>

<p>The Conference continued until the close of<br/>
Sunday the <time datetime=""",04/11/1852
42658.0,499,,""">11</time>th.</p>

<p>On the last day after an address from [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
C. Kimball]] who remarked that Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] was Chief Bishop<br/>
and had the right to choose his two councillors the Presiding<br/>
Bishop arose and said he should choose men who could assist.<br/>
Brigham Young was at the head and his councillors were inspired<br/>
of the Holy Ghost."" I select for my councillors Brigham Young<br/>
and Heber C. Kimball.""</p>

<p>Then Brother Heber C. <strike>F</strike>Kimball and <br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] laid hands upon Bishop Hunter's head and<br/>
blessed him and <strike>said</strike> ^H C Kimball said^</p>

<p>""O God the Eternal Father I ask in the name<br/>
of Jesus Christ while we lay our hands upon <strike>they head</strike> ^the head of thy servant^ that all<br/>
our words may be dictated by the Holy Ghost while we set<br/>
apart brother Hunter as a presiding Bishop. We hereby set<br/>
you apart to be a presiding Bishop and to be a judge in <br/>
Israel. We bless you with the Spirit of your office and <br/>
calling. You shall have wisdom to judge between good<br/>
and evil in all things and to be a great benefit to the house<br/>
of Israel and that they may uphold thee by their faith that<br/>
thou mayest administer in faith and righteousness and be a <br/>
great blessing to the people and administer to the poor and needy<br/>
Thou shalt have discernment like the lightning to detect the <br/>
evil and those who seek to deceive and that all may receive thy<br/>
teachings and thy work may work together for the good of all<br/>
the people: even so Amen.""</p>

<p>^Of^ <strike>To</strike> Brother Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball</p>",
42658.0,500,,"<p>said:</p>

<p>""You should be blessed and all your house and not one of them<br/>
shall be last and no man shall get between me and Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>
and Brother [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Richards]] and no man or woman shall get between the<br/>
Twelve and Presidency: if they do they will get pinched and<br/>
any man or woman who tried to get between us will be damned<br/>
They tried to prejudice [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] against us in his day and they will be<br/>
damned</p>

<p>""The Twelve are the best men that live and any<br/>
man who tries to put their feet upon their neck will get the<br/>
feet of the Twelve upon their own neck.""</p>

<p>President Young came in at this moment and brother<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] continued</p>

<p>""Do as brother Brigham tells you and all will<br/>
be right and you will not have sorrow. Follow my counsel<br/>
and you will not have sorrow. If my family would take<br/>
my counsel and had faith in me I would never have a<br/>
doctor in my family <strike>for</strike> ^but^ I have doctors here that I have faith<br/>
in <strike>but</strike> <strike>l</strike>Let me send for a doctor and they have faith in him<br/>
and not in me and then what further am I.""</p>

<p>Brother Brigham observed, ""That is true<br/>
and worthy of note.""</p>

<p>""If you are not one you are not mine saith<br/>
the Lord; but if you abide in me you will bring forth fruit<br/>
to the glory of God. When we learn this lesson our sorrows<br/>
will cease. When we get the clock off we shall be in heaven<br/>
In this house is my heaven for I am in a heavenly place<br/>
with holy men and angels."" x x x x x x x x</p>

<p>The old lion's neck is out of the yoke and<br/>
they will not put it on again for Brother Brigham shall whip<br/>
them out and they shall not whip him out nor me nor my <br/>
breathren. You shall be blessed and the earth shall bring<br/>
forth for your good and you shall be blessed in your posterity</p>",
42658.0,501,1852-04-23,"<p>and I say it in the name of Jesus Christ""</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said the words of brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
was a prophecy and was true.</p>

spirit of prophecy rested upon us while we were laying our hands<br/>

a great degree the heavens were opened unto us and our minds were<br/>
filled with visions revelations and prophecy while we sealed great<br/>
blessings upon the heads of the Elders as we were moved upon by<br/>
the Holy Ghost. We foretold to them what would befall them<br/>
by sea and by land and that they would do a great work and gather<br/>
many Saints and much wealth to Zion.</p>

<p>December the 22nd the quorum of the <br/>

Apostles. The abs<strike>s</strike>ent member of our quorum was</p>",
42658.0,506,,"<p>[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] who had gone to Washington to preach the Gospel to the<br/>
President Senators and legislators of the nation</p>

<p>This was</p>

<p>An Important Council of Twelve Apostles</p>

<p>I never saw so many of them together before in Council. The<br/>
meeting ^opened^ by prayer from [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] the President who then made<br/>
some appropriate remarks and wished us to interchange our<br/>
hearty congratulations in acknowledging the mercy and blessings<br/>
of God</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] made happy referrence to<br/>
our vast seperation and mercipul re-union. this was the<br/>
first opportunity we had had of being together as a quorum<br/>
He felt that every member of the quorum had confidence in<br/>
each other and in the Presidency of the Church. He said</p>

<p>""I feel as though the day is not far distant when<br/>
men will stand among us in this immortal bodies holding<br/>
the keys of death and hell and that brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] would<br/>
say if he was angry with us that we had suffered enough<br/>
and that we should be numbered among his jewels.""</p>

<p>He alluded to the great work we had to perform<br/>
the building of a Temple &amp;c</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff next spoke and noted<br/>
among other things the peculiar fact that up to that date there<br/>
had never been a death in the quorum of the Twelve Apostles<br/>
of this dispensation except in the case of [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]] who<br/>
fell a martyr for his religion according to the special request<br/>
that he made of the Lord that he might die that death. But<br/>
the rest of the quorum of the Twelve had stood in the front of<br/>
the battle and danger for the last twenty years. He refered to<br/>
the great prosperity and work of the Twelve abroad among<br/>
the nations and rejoiced that the Lord had preserved them to</p>",
42658.0,507,,"<p>return from the four corners of the earth to again sit in council together<br/>
in Zion.</p>

<p>[[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] followed. He had known the quorum of the<br/>
Twelve from the beginning since they were first together in his father's house<br/>
since his absence to Denmark on mission he had learnt how to appreciate<br/>
the society of home and his brethren, &amp;c.</p>

<p>[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] said we were at liberty to prophesy while<br/>
together as moved upon by the Holy Ghost and if we did not feel to<br/>
prophesy to speak by faith and it should be fulfilled. He had unlimited<br/>
confidence in every member of the Twelve and the Presidency and<br/>
prophesied in the name of God that we should all meet and<br/>
come forth in the first resurrection and receive our crowns in<br/>
the celestial Kingdom"" which was confirmed by a good Amen<br/>
by all the quorum.</p>

<p>[[John Whittaker Taylor|<u>John</u> <u>Taylor</u>]] next spoke and referred to the changes<br/>
among the nations and said that the ^doors^ was near when Kings would <br/>
seek counsel at our hands. ""In the beginning the Elders<br/>
went out ignorant ment now they are full of intelligence<br/>
and the nations of the earth will feel their influence.""<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] was delighted with the<br/>
occasion and rejoiced to see the union of the quorum and their<br/>
dispositions to do right. "" We dont have to feel that [[Lyman Wight|Lyman<br/>
Wight]] is drawing off one way [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] another and [[William Smith|W<u>m</u><br/>
Smith]] committing iniqiuty and we forced to sustain them<br/>
against our feelings. I have the satisfaction of believing<br/>
that each member of the quorum <u>was</u> is doing right and I<br/>
rejoice that the quorum have been able to publish the Gospel<br/>
in six different languages and to gather the people together. He<br/>
hoped we should meet once a week and with the Presidents<br/>
offer our Prayers; felt a proud satisfaction in being associated<br/>
with 10 men whom he believed ^possessed^ the most intelligence of any<br/>
men upon the earth and believed the prophesies of that evening<br/>
would be fulfilled. He closed with his blessing upon us.</p>",
42658.0,508,,"<p>Among other remarks [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] said He had<br/>
found out what that love and affection for his brethren is that surpasses<br/>
the love of woman for he had a confidence in his quroum far greater<br/>
than in his wives and children, for his brethren had been brought up<br/>
in the hard school of experience and had been tried in all things and<br/>
proven true and I have been proven with them. I am wedded to<br/>
my quorum with all my interest. I go when I am sent and come<br/>
when I am called and so expect to continue to do. My interest<br/>
is insepera<strike>tely</strike>belly connectd with this Kingdom and I trust ever will<br/>
be through time and eternity.</p>

<p>[[Charles Coulson Rich|C. C. Rich]] expressed his feelings and said, ""on<br/>
my way home I had a dream. I thought the ancients in their<br/>
resurrected bodies were associated with us in this place. I have<br/>
the most unbounded faith in the quorum of the Twelve and in<br/>
the First Presidency. I hope the Winter Season may be<br/>
profitable to us in our associations and that we may improve <strike>our</strike><br/>
out time.""</p>

<p>[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] next spoke and among a member<br/>
of remarks said<br/>
""If the First Presidency were to be removed the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve would have to preside and if they had<br/>
not the fulness of the girst they would not be fit to preside<br/>
I feel exceedingly thankful to be associated with such men. I<br/>
have not language to express my feelings when I was first<br/>
called to be an Apostle in this quorum. I could not sleep<br/>
for three days and nights. I feel now as though I could<br/>
break a nation to pieces. I felt renovated with the<br/>
Holy Spirit while [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] was speaking. No blessing<br/>
is too great or too good for us and we shall possess them<br/>
all.""</p>

<p>[[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] said his sentiments<br/>
were shadowed forth in his labours. I have great joy<br/>
in meeting with you am beholding your faces and contemplating.</p>",
42658.0,509,,"<p>the influence and power of this quorum and the greatness of their work<br/>
I anticipate much this Winter in our meetings and in enjoying the<br/>
blessing of God. I have rejoiced this night to hear the exalted expressions<br/>
of the quorum in rendering than<strike>k</strike>sgiving to God and not one word<br/>
of complaint of hardships inprisonments or afflictions of any kind<br/>
but we are filled with hidden joy and peace. I feel determined<br/>
to do all that is asigned me that I may be worthy a place in<br/>
this quorum. I felt grateful to hear the blessings pronounced<br/>
upon us by our President.""</p>

<p>He closed with joy and thanksgiving.<br/>
Wilford Woodruff next addressed the quorum upon<br/>
the importance of their keeping private histories of their<br/>
lives labours and ministry and also a joint history of the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He said since he had been<br/>
a member of the Church he had been inpired not only to write<br/>
all his own acts and life but to write the sermons teachings<br/>
and prophesies of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] , President [Brigham Young|Young] and council<br/>
and of the Twelve Apostles as far as he was acquainted with<br/>
their labours. He said each member of the quorum should keep an account of his own mission works miracles and the <br/>
blessings of God unto him and that the history of the Twelve<br/>
Apostles could now be easily obtained; but if we omitted<br/>
it until we are dead our friends could not get it correctly<br/>
before the world.</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] spoke of the filling up of <br/>
the quorum of the Twelve in 1848 and of their commencing a <br/>
record of the Twelve Apostles and wished it continued. He<br/>
did not know how far and minute we ought to be but<br/>
thought we ought to record our official acts and considered it<br/>
for our interest as well as a duty thus to do.</p>

<p>[[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] said President [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] wished<br/>
him to request the younger members of the quorum to hand<br/>
to him a short statement of their lives and ministry to go</p>",
42658.0,510,,"<p>into the Church History.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] Wilford Woodruff and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P<br/>
Pratt]] interchanged a few words upon the subject of Journal keeping</p>

<p>[[Franklin Dewey Richards|<u>Franklin </u>D. <u>Richards</u>]] next spoke and said I feel<br/>
behind most of the quorum in not having the privilege of so much<br/>
teaching and counsel from brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] as they have. When I<br/>
contemplate the future I feel that the field of our labour is equal <br/>
to the noblest ambition which man could entertain both in this<br/>
world and the next. He felt hisjoy tempered in the recolection</p>

<p>[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] said:</p>

<p>""While I have been listening I have<br/>
had an unusual train of reflection. Of necessity we shall<br/>
soon be called again to seperate and the Kingdoms of this world<br/>
must become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ. We<br/>
are trained in the school of experience. I may live to see you <br/>
all in different parts of the earth and while the Kingdoms of<br/>
the earth are falling you will in many instances be enable<br/>
to stre<strike>dr</strike>ch out your hands and give counsel and save many<br/>
people and be enabled to rule governments and thus fulfill the<br/>
prophecies. Many of these things are not afar off. All<br/>
is eternity to us whether this or the other side of the veil<br/>
We are born in eternity and let us be where we will it will<br/>
be our calling to win souls unto Christ. The Presidency<br/>
are unwell or they would be here. I wish the Journals<br/>
of the Twelve to be written up so that they can be on hand<br/>
when needed to be published. I wish each one of the <br/>
quorum to write as good an epistle as he can and have<br/>
the whole put in a book form and sent forth into the world""</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt thought the subject abounded<br/>
in us. ""We owe the world a testimony not as individuals<br/>
but as a quorum of the Twelve Apostles""</p>

<p>He suggested that each should contribute<br/>
an epistle and from the whole compile and embody a book</p>",
42658.0,511,,"<p>to go forth with the signatures of all the quorum as the combined ""<u>History</u><br/>
of the <u>Twelve</u> <u>Apostles</u></p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|<u>George</u> <u>A.</u> <u>Smith</u>]] thought it very important that<br/>
an authentic history of eah member should be preserved.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff mentioned certain items which he<br/>
considered necessary in the preservation of our history. He lamented<br/>
that [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]] had not left any record of his life for he was a<br/>
Prophet and an Apostle and a mighty man. Many miracles were<br/>
wrought by him. He told a rich man in Tennessee who fought<br/>
the work of God that he and his family should beg their bread. [[Robert C. Petty|Robert<br/>
C. Petty]] saw that same man cry at a blaksmith's shop because<br/>
he could not get trusted to have his plough sharpened""</p>

<p>President [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] moved that Wilford Woodruff<br/>
be the cleark and historian of the Twelve Apostles. Carried<br/>
unanimously</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] proposed a new reord and wished that<br/>
the Narative of each of the quorum of the Twelve be first recorded<br/>
in it beginning with the President and going through with each<br/>
member in order as he stands in the quorum</p>

<p>W. Woodruff said he was willing to serve the<br/>
quorum as its historian as faithfully as he could through it would<br/>
be a heavy tax on his time.</p>

<p>[[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] enquired if the History<br/>
contemplated is to be confined to the present quorum or the members<br/>
from the beginning</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt throught it should merely include<br/>
the present quorum.</p>

<p>Erastus Snow would like to see included all<br/>
that could be found of David W. Patten</p>

<p>[[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] observed that the morning of<br/>
the day when David Patten was martyred he said the Kingdom<br/>
of God should be delivered or he should lay down his life</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt wished brother Woodruff</p>",
42658.0,512,,"<p>to leave all temporal business as much as possible and bring this<br/>
History up.</p>

<p>[[Amasa Mason Lyman|A. Lyman]] said there was no date of his ordination</p>

<p>[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] proposed for the Twelve to meet with<br/>
the Presidency and also to meet each week for a mutual exchange<br/>
of thought.</p>

<p>We then adjourned to meet at the same place one week from that date</p>

<p>On the 29 of Dec the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
met and spent the evening upon conversation upon some plan for<br/>
liberating ourselves and families so that we could be foot-loose<br/>
to go and preach the Gospel</p>

<p>On the last day of <time datetime=""1852-12"">Dec 1852</time> I looked over<br/>

<p>I wrote in my Journal at the time</p>

<p><u>My Reflections on the New Year.</u></p>

<p>A new year in the midst of a new era! Oh how<br/>
time flies and how great how important how magnificent are the <br/>
events b<strike>ro</strike>orne on its wings. It is the opening of a dispensation<br/>
that swallows up all other dispensations since the world began<br/>
The deeds of the last thousand years sink into insignificence in<br/>
comparison to the work of the present time</p>

<p>The heavens gaze upon the scenes as<br/>
they pass with deep interest while the whole earth behold the<br/>
scenes in wonder and amazement. The ancient Prophets saw<br/>
by vision and revelation the scenes which were to follow each<br/>
other in quick succession in this age in the establishment of the<br/>
great Kingdom of God to be thrown down no more forever. The<br/>
little stone cut out of the mountain without hands which was to<br/>
roll forth until it became a mountain and filled the whole earth</p>",
42658.0,515,,"<p>1853<br/>
breaking in pieces and subduing all other kingdoms and itself to stand forever<br/>
as seen by the Prophet [[David (OT)|David]] has commenced its work.</p>

<p>That Church and Kingdom of God is now on the <br/>
earth and is being established and must endure. The world are gazing<br/>
upon it, located in these valleys of the mountains like a City set upon <br/>
a hill which cannot be hid.  Its first Prophet and founder has laid<br/>
down his life in its defence. He has been martyred and his blood<br/>
is crying from the ground for vengeance upon a great nation. Many<br/>
others have fallen martyrs to the truth and the Gospel of Jesus Christ<br/>
since the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ in A. D. 1830 -<br/>
and many more may; yet the Church is bound to rise and prosper<br/>
until the Zion and Kingdom of our God shall stand forth in bold<br/>
relief with all that power might majesty and dominion which God<br/>
has declared concurring her and which has been spoken through the<br/>
mouths of his holy Prophets since the world began</p>

<p>This Church and Kingdom has continued<br/>
steadily to arise since its first organization amid opposition oppression<br/>
persecution and martyrdom until it has become established in the midst<br/>
of the ""everlasting hills"" not only gaining strength in Church but <br/>
also in State</p>

<p>[[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]]s nobles are of himself and his Governor<br/>
has proceeded out of the midst of him. And while truth inspires<br/>
my heart shall I feelt to write it? Shall I feer that the <br/>
present or future generations may read these truths which are<br/>
burning in my breast unkindled by the atlars of heaven? No<br/>
God forbid! for the voice of truth whispers to me that our Governors<br/>
Presidents and Senators now arising out of the Kingdom of God will<br/>
be inspired to take bold measures perform during acts and in their<br/>
strength and power stretch forth their strong arm and save <strike>from</strike><br/>
annihilation that holy instrument _ the Constitution of the United<br/>
States which the ^American^ people are about to sell for a mess of pottage<br/>
and try to consign it to the grave; but there is a power who <br/>
has decreed that liberty freedom and the rights of the meek of the</p>",
42658.0,516,,"<p>Earth shall not wholly die; and that power is God. He has decreed to<br/>
inspire and nerve up the soul the sinew and the own of his governors<br/>
senators and Prophets and own them for the contest and defend them<br/>
in their warefare. That nation or Kingdom or tongue or people<br/>
from this time forth who shall rise up against Zion - the Church and<br/>
Kingdom of God - to oppress her shall be visited by the judgements<br/>
of the Most High and be overthrown and brought to desolation<br/>
and may God spedily hasten it. May the Almighty begin<br/>
this year to rend the Kingdoms of this world with his servants<br/>
and continue it until all nations shall acknowledge there is<br/>
a God in Israel.""</p>

<p>On the 1st day of the new year the Quorum of the <br/>
Twelve Apostles met at the Council House at 8 o'clock being eleven<br/>
in number: [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] was absent in Washington</p>

<p>The quorum marched to President [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]]'s and wished him a happy new year. President Young<br/>
received them with joy and gladness and aftre the greetings<br/>
were over he asked us what he should treat us <strike>to</strike>with. The<br/>
sentiment was instantaneous in the hearts of all the quorum<br/>
and spoken by President [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]: ""Treat us with your<br/>
blessing.""</p>

<p>Then President Young blessed the quorum of the<br/>
Twelve Apostles and said they always had his blessing; and<br/>
the Twelve felt and realized that the blessings of the Presidency<br/>
of the Church and Kingdom of God was of far more worth and<br/>
benefit to them than any earthly gift or the treasures of the<br/>
earth and their hearts were full of joy and gladness.</p>

<p>The Twelve left their blessings upon President<br/>
Young and his house. While they were paying their respects<br/>
to him the band was playing a lively tune in the front of<br/>
the house. The quorum saluted the two bands with a<br/>
happy new year and received in return some escellent music</p>",
42658.0,517,,"<p><br/>
The quorum of the Twelve next visited President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C.<br/>
Kimball]] and wished him a happy New Year and he also received them<br/>
with gladness and gave unto them his blessing which was also highly prized<br/>
In his blessing unto them he said his faith and feelings were that no<br/>
one of the present quorum of Apostles should ever fall and no power should<br/>
take their crown and Kingdom; but they should come forth in the morning<br/>
of the first resurrection and be exalted to glory immortality and eternal<br/>
lives. Their blessings should increase from that time hencforth<br/>
and forever and they should not want bread but they should have means<br/>
to support themselves and families.""</p>

<p>The Twelve left their blessings upon President<br/>
Kimball and then visited Father [[John Smith, b. 1832|John Smith]] the aged Patriarch of the<br/>
Church and wished him a happy new year. He manifested much<br/>
joy and satisfaction in seeing eleven of the Twelve Apostles beneath<br/>
his roof. This venerable Patriarch also bestowed upon the Twelve<br/>
his blessing and said they should live to see the Kingdom of God<br/>
and Zion established to be thrown down no more forever and that<br/>
none of them should ever fall but they should have part in the<br/>
first resurrection. No power should take their crowns but<br/>
they should be blessed in all their labours in the earth and the<br/>
blessings of God should increase upon them from that time<br/>
forth both temporal and spiritual.</p>

<p>The Apostles also left their blessings upon<br/>
the Patriarch and his household and next visited President [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]<br/>
who received them in like manner and was saluted by them<br/>
with the happy new year. He also gave the Twelve his<br/>
blessing. He believed this the beginning of an eventful year<br/>
in the history of this Church and that each succeeding one would<br/>
be more and more so until the Coming of the Son of Man. He<br/>
said the Twelve were ever before him in his thoughts prayers and<br/>
blessings notwithstanding they might be scattered to the four corners<br/>
of the earth. They were men of God and were destined<br/>
to perform a great and mighty work upon the earth and they</p>",
42658.0,518,,"<p>should live till they were satisfied with life and see light and truth prevail<br/>
over sin and tradition.""</p>

<p>The Twelve then went to the house of Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]]<br/>
and there united with his family in singing the ""Return of the Twelve""<br/>
and other songs of Zion. The spirit and power of God rested upon <br/>
them and their hearts were filled with praise and thanksgiving to<br/>
God in all their visits of this the new year of 1853.</p>

<p>The bands continued their salutations throughout<br/>
the city and their enliveing music was everywhere received with open<br/>
ears and hearts of joy.</p>

<p>Dedication of Social Hall</p>

<p>During the evening the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
with the Presidency and about 200 of the Saints met with our families<br/>
at the Social Hall and dedicated it to the purpose for which it<br/>
was built after which they went forth in the dance finishing<br/>
their enjoyments of this new year's day.</p>

<p>Sunday the 2nd Bro [[Joseph Toronto|Joseph Toronto]] gave an<br/>
account of his travels through [[Italy|Italy]] and the dangers he ran in<br/>
preaching the Gospel to his native country. He was among the<br/>
Waldensees</p>

<p>On the following Sunday after an interesting<br/>
discourse ^from P. P. Pratt^ brother Groward gave an interesting account of his<br/>
mission on the Western Islands - of his travels among the natives,<br/>
his sufferings among them, and the opposition by the French<br/>
Government. He was 9 years on his mission and several <br/>
years without hearing anything from the Church and his mental<br/>
sufferings were very great. The first he received was a letter<br/>
I wrote to him and that he did not obtain until two years after<br/>
it was written.</p>

<p>On the Sunday Jan 2nd President [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] met with the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
and the same subject was brought up and talked over as on the 29<br/>
of December. President Young said the best way for the Twelve<br/>
to get a living for themselves and families was to preach the</p>",
42658.0,519,1853-02-14,"<p>Gospel with all their might and ""your means will come in your way. [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|T.<br/>
B. Marsh]] once said he did not know what [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] called the Twelve for<br/>
unless it was to abuse them and I told him if the Twelve were faithful<br/>
they would soon see the day that they would have all the influence<br/>
they could weild.""</p>

<p><strike>The</strike> President Young said laying plans in our present<br/>
situation for perpetual cover was all a shadow. We may lay <br/>
plans but they may be frustrated""</p>

<p>The Legislature closed its session of the year on the<br/>
night of the 21st of January</p>

<p>Sunday 23rd [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] preached upon the <br/>
subject that the hand of God had been in the working out of the events<br/>
and changes among the nations to prepare for his work - such as the<br/>
reformation of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and others God's inspiring [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to the<br/>
discovery of America the invention of railroads telegraphs &amp;c and in the<br/>
revolutions among the nations. [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]<br/>
followed both advoating the same views.</p>

<p>On the 26th Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] had a son born but<br/>
it only lived two hours. I blessed it before it died and named it<br/>
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1853|Aphek]]. I buried it during the day in my garden.</p>

<p>Sunday the 30th Parley P. Pratt preached a<br/>
fine discourse upon the subject of the Kingdom of God to be set up<br/>
in the last days</p>

<p><u>Breaking</u> <u>The</u> <u>Ground</u> <u>For</u> <u>The</u> <u>Temple</u></p>

<p><time datetime=""",02/14/1853
42658.0,519,,"""><u>Feburary the 14th 1853</u></time></p>

<p>This was an important day to the Saints in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]]<br/>
and even in all the world.</p>

<p>The Saints met upon the Temple Block in a <br/>
vast body to break the ground for another ^Temple^. The people commenced<br/>
gathering at ane arly hour and at eleven o'clock there were thousands</p>",
42658.0,520,,"<p>upon the ground. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and Council the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
and many of the quorums of the Church were there and all the bands of music<br/>
in the City were in attendance.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock President Brigham Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
C. Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] got into a buggy inside the square<br/>
surrounded by the quorum of the Twelve. President Young then<br/>
arose and addressed the assembly upon the subject of building Temples<br/>
I recorded it in my journal but it is published in the Journal of Discourses<br/>
Vol I[1].</p>

<p>After the address of President Young Heber C. Kimbell<br/>
arose and with uplifted hands to heaven offered up a fervant heart:felt<br/>
prayer to God imploring his blessing upon President Young and his <br/>
Councillors and all the authorities of the Church with the whole house<br/>
of Israel. He then dedicated the ground unto God and prayed<br/>
for his blessings to attend them in building the Temple and all the<br/>
public works in Zion.</p>

<p>At the close of the prayer the Presidency and Twelve<br/>
walked to the South East corner of the ground laid out for the Temple<br/>
The earth being frozen President Heber C. Kimball commenced breaking<br/>
the ground with a pick. Then President Richards did the same<br/>
and then [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] Wilford Woodruff [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]<br/>
[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lymon]] [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]] [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] [[Erastus Snow|Erastus<br/>
Snow]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D. Richards.]]  Then the gound was broke<br/>
and President Brigham Young took out the first turf<strike>f</strike> and while<br/>
taking it out a silver dollar from some one in the congregation was<br/>
thrown which struck in the hole. Brother Kimball said that<br/>
was our omen that we should have plenty of money to build the<br/>
Temple with.</p>

<p>[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] was at this time at Washington and <br/>
[[George Albert Smith| A Smith]] at [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]] but all the rest of the Twelve were present<br/>
at the breaking of the ground for the Temple.</p>

<p>As soon as the turf was taken out the<br/>
congregation was dismissed and the people rushed to the hole to get</p>",
42658.0,521,1853-03-01,"<p>a chance to throw a little dirt out. My father [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]] aged 70 years<br/>
myself Wilford Woodruff aged 46 and my son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford Woodruff]] aged 12 years<br/>
all threw out dirt from the foundation of this important temple.</p>

<p>After leaving the ground in company with the Presidency<br/>
and Twelve I went to see the new sugar works operate. I saw the hydraulic<br/>
press pressing out the juice. Brother [[Joseph Russell|Joseph Russell]] of Marimichi had<br/>
furnished about fifty thousand dollars to purchase the machinery and apperatus<br/>
and get it to the Valley to make sugar from the beet.</p>

<p>My children [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]] [[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe]] and [[Susan Cornelia Woodruff Scholes|Susan]] also [[Emma Manella Woodruff|Emma]] and <br/>
[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] were all present at the breaking of the ground for the foundation<br/>
of the Temple.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 20th President [[Brigham Young|Young]] delivered a discourse<br/>
which I reported and recorded in my journal but it is also published in the<br/>
Journal of Discourses Vol I [1] and as at about this date is the commencement<br/>
of the publication of the Sermons of the Presidency and Twelve I shall<br/>
only transcribe from my daily journal such as may not be found<br/>

<p>The General Conference commenced this morning and<br/>
it was one of the most interesting ever held by the Church since<br/>
its organization.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the day was afterwards published<br/>
in the Deseret News and copied from thence into the L. D. Saints<br/>
Millennial Star and therefore I shall not record it here. I <br/>
will say however that the four corner stones of the Temple</p>",
42658.0,522,,"<p>were laid in [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] on this day</p>

<p>The Presidency laid the South East corner stone<br/>
with the Patriarch; Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Edward Hunter]] and Council with the<br/>
lesser Priesthood laid the South West Corner stone; John Young<br/>
the President of the High Priests Quorum and Council the President<br/>
of the Stake and Council with the High Council <strike>of</strike> laid the North<br/>
West corner stone; The Twelve Apostles First Presidency of the <br/>
Seventies and Presidency of the Elders quorum laid the North<br/>
East corner stone.</p>

<p>There was a prayer offered on each corner<br/>
stone and also an oration delivered and a song sung as they<br/>
were severally laid.</p>

<p>There were gathered on this occasion the<br/>
largest assembly of Saints ever gathered together in Deseret.</p>

<p>The proceedings occupied until 2 o'clock<br/>
After the laying of the North East Corner Stone by the Twelve<br/>
etc. which closed the ceremony President [[Brigham Young|Young]] ascended the stone<br/>
and gave his benediction as follows.</p>

<p>Brethren and sisters I bless you in the <br/>
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth and pray my father in <br/>
heaven to encircle you in the arms of his love and mercy<br/>
protect us until we have finished the Temple receive the<br/>
fulness of our endowments therein and then build many more<br/>
And I pray also that we may live to see the great Temple in <br/>
Jackson County Missouri. You ano dismissed with<br/>
the blessings of the Lord Jesus Christ upon your heads<br/>
Amen.""</p>

<p>The procession then returned to the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] <br/>
and were dismissed by President Young until 3 o'clock</p>

<p>President Brigham Young delivered a very<br/>
interesting discourse in the afternoon which is published. Brother<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] said that the Seventies had a portion of all the Apostleship<br/>
to had all the Elders but none were ordained to the fulness of</p>",
42658.0,523,,"<p>the Apostleship except the Twelve or those who are ordained to that office.</p>

<p>[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] told a dream. He said that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
came to him and told him to dip a large lake dry and gave him a<br/>
spoon to do it with. He said he thought he could have no impression<br/>
upon it with a spoon but still he would obey counsel and he went<br/>
dipping and soon had lowered the lake five feet. Then Joseph told<br/>
him he could not always judge of things by appearances but the<br/>
Lord would do all for us that our hearts could desire.</p>

<p>On the 7th the Conference was called to order by <br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] who presented to us a text _ a set of fire irons made by the<br/>
brethren from the native iron in [[Iron County, Utah Territory|Iron County]].</p>

<p>[[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin Clapp]] arose and made confession that <br/>
he had been in darkness and had done wrong in many things. He<br/>
desired to be forgiven and retained in the Church. He was forgiven</p>

<p>The authorities of the Church were presented and<br/>
sustained.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] was called upon to preach an iron sermon<br/>
He took one of the fire irons made from native iron and swung<br/>
it round his head and cried out stereotyped edition and then <br/>
descended amidst the cheers of the congregation.</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] read his oration<br/>
delivered on the corner stone of the Temple and also preached his sermon<br/>
of that day published in the Deseret News.</p>

<p>After dismissing the meeting the Presidency and<br/>
others met in the vestry and [[James Allred|James Alread]] [[Asahel Perry|Aschel Perry]] and<br/>
[[Charles Walker Hyde|Charles Walker Hyde]] were ordained Patriarchs under the hands<br/>
of Presidents Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Richards]]</p>

<p>The meeting being opened on the following<br/>
day President Kimball arose and said we have a number chosen to<br/>
go on missions and then 23 names were given and set apart<br/>
to their different stations in Europe and five to other parts of the<br/>
world. Their names are published in the ""News"".</p>

<p>President Young afterwards arose and gave a</p>",
42658.0,524,1853-10-06,"<p>text _ ""The Right of Heirship"" and preached an important discourse from it<br/>
which is published.</p>

for a Special Conference to appoint Elders to go abroad.</p>

<p>The President closed with, ""And I bless every man<br/>
and woman in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen"" and then President<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] gave the benediction.</p>

<p>May the 2nd President [[Brigham Young|Young]] returned home<br/>
from his Southern visit and the Legion went out and escorted<br/>
him into the City; and on the following Sunday President Young<br/>
addressed the people upon the subject of his journey South.</p>

<p>There had been at this date considerable<br/>
excitement about the Indians and expectations of war with<br/>
them.</p>

<p>Sunday the 29 [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] spoke upon <br/>
the linage of our fathers and that we should seek to obtain it<br/>
and in the afternoon President ^Young^ delivered a powerful discourse rebuking<br/>
wickedness with a sharp two edged sword.</p>

<p>The 4th of July was celebrated by the <br/>
citizens an account of which is published in the Deseret News of <br/>
July 10th.</p>

<p>The 24 of July came on a Sunday and<br/>
the Saints celebrated the enterance of the Pioneers into the Valley<br/>
by worshiping God in the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]].</p>

<p>Next day I and my family attended a feast<br/>
at [[Big Cottonwood Creek, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Big Cottonwood]] in honour of the enterance of the Pioneers upon<br/>

42658.0,525,,"<p>My sister had a long illness and she sent me word that she died a full believer<br/>
in Mormonism.</p>

<p>On the 31st of July President [[Brigham Young|Young]] preached a discourse upon<br/>
the subject of our Indian war for we had had a war with [[Chief Walker|Walker]] and his<br/>
band for about three weeks. The Saints were gathering in out of the<br/>
small settlements and fortifying themselves.<br/>
Two brethren had been killed<br/>
and three wounded and 10 Indians killed as supposed.</p>

<p><u>Special Conference of the Church</u></p>

<p>It conviened Saturday the 13th of August and continued over the<br/>
Sunday. I did not record the minutes in my Journal</p>

<p>On the 19th I baptized brother and sister Rose and confirmed<br/>
them.</p>

<p>On the 25th I rode in company with Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] to<br/>
Weber and spent the night with him.</p>

<p><u>Locating the [[Weber River, Utah Territory|Weber Settle<strike>m</strike>nient]]</u></p>

<p>I was sent by President [[Brigham Young|Young]] to locate the fort for the inhabitants as<br/>
they could not agree among themselves. They had moved it several<br/>
times and still were disatisfied.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival I rode throughout<br/>
the Weber Settlement on both sides of the river examining the whole of the <br/>
country and collected the whole people together at 12 o'clock. I preached to<br/>
them 2 hours and heard them talk two hours more. I then<br/>
established the fort on the South side of the river in the midst<br/>
of the farming lands. I was weary and spent the night at Brother<br/>
Kingtons.</p>

<p>Next day I left Weber and rod to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]]<br/>
through hard rain showers. I then mounted a<strike>g</strike> horse and rode to<br/>
[[John Benbow|John Benbows]] on Cottonwood and spent the night with him. [[William Benbow|William<br/>
Benbow]] with two daughters had arrived from Wisconsin and</p>",

his two daughters [[Ann Bagley Benbow|Ann]] and [[Marion Benbow Bell|Marion]] and confirmed them and then with<br/>
John and [[William Benbow|W<u>m</u> Benbow]] I returned to the City.</p>

<p>General Conference of the Church <br/>
<time datetime=""",10/06/1853
42658.0,526,,""">October the 6th 1853</time></p>

<p>The Conference lasted from the 6th until the 9th during which time<br/>
much business was done. Many missionaries were chosen to go<br/>
to the Lamanites and to various places besides and much instruction<br/>
was given by the Presidency and Twelve. All the proceedings<br/>
are published in the Deseret News. I received a mission in<br/>
connection with [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]] for the settlement of [[Tooele, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Toella]].<br/>
We were to pick but fifty families to settle that place. President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] gave an address to the missionaries which I reported<br/>
and gave him.</p>

<p>Sunday Nov the 14th the Twelve met with the <br/>
company of Elders who were appointed to go to [[Green River, Sweetwater County, Wyoming Territory|Green River]] to establish<br/>
a station at that place. We blessed them and set them apart<br/>
for the work. They were addressed by Wilford Woodruff and<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]. This was the second company for that place<br/>
making in all 90 men.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 16th day of Nov I<br/>
met with the Regency upon whom the Presidency had called<br/>
to get up a new alphabet and make an imrovement in the English<br/>
language. The Regency had sat several evenings for that purpose</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt had commenced a Spanish<br/>
school and I was attending it to learn the language.</p>

<p>On the 20th in company with [[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]]<br/>
and Dr. [[Woodville Morris Andrews|Andrews]] I rode to [[Tooele, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Toella City]] and spent the night at <br/>
Bishop [[John Rowberry|Robery's]].</p>

<p>New day was Sunday and we tode to</p>",
42658.0,527,,"<p>[[Willow Creek, Utah Territory|Willow Creek]] settlement and held a meeting with the people. I spoke to them<br/>
and was followed by [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]].</p>

<p>There were about one hundred men in this settlement<br/>
and they were beginning to fort up; and there were also about one hundred<br/>
friendly Indians. All settlements were counselled to life in forts<br/>
until they could wall in their cities. [[Thomas Clark|Thomas Clark]] was the Bishop<br/>
and we duined with him.</p>

<p>From Willow Creek on the same day I rode back<br/>
to [[Tooele, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Toella City]] and preached to a large congregation and on the following<br/>
day I returned to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] but stoped on the way and appointed <br/>
a cite for a new fort and city.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 4th of December the mail came<br/>
in bringing good news from the Elders and tidings that war was <br/>
proclaimed between [[Russia|Russia]] and [[Turkey, Ottoman Empire|Turkey]].</p>

<p>Sunday the 11th President [[Brigham Young|Young]] addressed the people<br/>
and I reported it and prepared it for the Press.</p>

<p>On Monday the 12th the Legislative Assembly<br/>
commenced its sessions and next day both houses in joint session<br/>
received the [[Brigham Young|Governor]] and his Message. I was one of the members<br/>
of the House.</p>

<p>Christmas day was on a Sunday. [[Hosea Stout|Hosea Stout]]<br/>
who had just returned from his mission to China addressed the congregation.<br/>
on the Chinees, their religion customs and pursuits including the<br/>
revolution among them at the time. In the afternoon [[Claudius Victor Spencer|Claudius<br/>
V. Spencer]] gave an account of his mission to England; and in<br/>
the evening I met with the 14th Ward and addressed the people<br/>
upon the subject of education and our duties to our children.</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day I met with <br/>
the 14th Ward and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]] delivered an address upon education<br/>
which I reported and spent the 30th in writing and preparing it.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Frandklin D. Richards]]<br/>
addressed the young people and the children in the morning in the Ward<br/>
and in the afternoon we met for a social party and I addressed them in the evening.</p>",

many and some in high places had risen up<br/>

him by his power and spirit to the convincing of the honest<br/>
that he would stand and his enemies fall. [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]] followed<br/>

walked from Syracuse to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] Oswego Co. N. Y.<br/>
where I was again blessed with the privilege of taking<br/>
by the hand my brethren after the flesh—namely,<br/>
[[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] and [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson Woodruff]]. I had not seen<br/>
either of them for three years. I found my cousin<br/>
<strike>Elad</strike> [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1812|^Eldad^ Woodruff]] with them.</p>

<p>There was something of a coldness<br/>
manifested by my family relatives towards myself<br/>
and the two brethren in the Church who accompanied<br/>
me. This was because of our religion and This coldness<br/>
was especially shown by [[Elizabeth Norton Hart Woodruff|Elizabeth]] my brother's wife</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that it was against<br/>
the principles of my brother's family to receive us for<br/>
the night we were permitted to sup with them and<br/>
one of my former neighbours Mr [[Walter Menter|Walter Menter]] gave<br/>
us a place to lay our heads for the night which we<br/>
gladly accepted.</p>

<p>I called in the morning at my brother<br/>
Azmon's and conversed with him and also my brother<br/>
Thompson upon temporal and spiritual subjects. Neither<br/>
of them manifested any hardness towards me in the<br/>
morning but both appeared affected. Brother Azmon<br/>
said he was still seeking for light and truth and should<br/>
not have left the Church of Latter-day Saints had it not<br/>
been for his trials and temptations &amp;c.</p>

<p>Having commended them to God I took the<br/>
parting hand of my brethren and their household feeling<br/>
perhaps that it might be the last time that I should see<br/>
them in the flesh. I left with some painful sensations<br/>
and a firm belief that there would be some change in their<br/>
household which presentiment I expressed to my brother<br/>
Azmon. In my heart I prayed the Lord's mercy upon<br/>
my brethren—kinsmen after the flesh but I ^could^ not say<br/>
as I left the threshold of his house the peace and</p>",

sister Calvins and Elder ^Duchers^ in [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson's county]] being a distance<br/>
of 24 miles during the day.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",06/06/1837

We also had an interview with brother [[Archibald Patten|Archibal Patten]]. At<br/>
10 o'clock at night we took passage on board the Oneida at<br/>
Sacketts Harbour and crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]] to [[Kingston, Upper Canada, British North America|Kingston]] in the<br/>
province of [[Upper Canada, British North America|Uper Canada]]</p>

<p>I was now in the dominions of [[Great Britain|Great Britain]]<br/>
and this was the first time that I ever trod the soil of the<br/>

42828.0,107,1837-06-09,""">8th</time> at 8 o'clock<br/>
a.m. at Kingston Mills to go up the canal. We passed through a<br/>
swamp of about twelve miles in length which abounded with<br/>
^fir &amp; such as muskrat otter beaver &amp;c.^</p>

<p>From [[Brewers Mills, Pittsburgh Township, Frontenac County, Canada West, British North America|Brewer's Mills]] we passed through [[Cranberry Lake, Canada West, British North America|Crambary<br/>
Marsh]] to [[Jones Falls, Canada West, British North America|Jones' Falls]] where the boat passed through four locks<br/>
which were built by the British Government and supposed to<br/>
be the most splendid works of the kind in America. They<br/>
cost four hundred thousand dollars being one hundred thousand<br/>
each. Yet notwithstanding these magnificient works the<br/>
face of the country presented a scene of the most gloomy<br/>
aspect; it being a rocky hilly barren uncultivated country</p>

<p>We left the boat at the locks and walked to<br/>
brother [[Artamus Judd|A^rtemus^ Judd's]] in the township of [[Bastard, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Bastard]] Leeds<br/>
County Upper Canada where we were joyfully received<br/>
by the Saints of God. They had been brought into the<br/>
Church through the instrumentality of Elders [[John Edward Page|J. E. Page]] and [[James Blakesly|J.<br/>

<p>The Conference consisted of 13 Elders 5 Priests<br/>
8 Teachers and 6 Deacons besides a large congregation<br/>
of Saints.</p>",
42828.0,108,,"<p>I was called upon to open the meeting by prayer. The<br/>
conference then proceeded to business.</p>

<p>There were eight Branches of the Church represented<br/>
consisting of 300 members in all. Thirty two brethren were<br/>
presented for ordination and Elder [[William Draper|William Draper]] and myself<br/>
were called upon to ordain them. We then ordained <br/>
7 Elders 9 Priests 11 Teachers and 5 Deacons. This with<br/>
some other matters filled up the business of the day.<br/>
Meeting then closed and I accompanied several brethren to<br/>
Elder [[Sylvester B. Stoddard|Stodard's]] where we spent the <strike>day</strike> ^night^.</p>

<p>The conference was continued on the next<br/>
day and I was called upon to address the congregation<br/>
in the morning service. It was with peculiar feelings<br/>
that I arose to address a large body of Saints in the<br/>
capacity of Conference raised up in another nation seperate<br/>
from my own and under another Government. This<br/>
was the first time that I had ever addressed a congregation<br/>
of Saints under the British rule. I preached<br/>
from the ##2Corinthians 4:3-4|2<sup>nd</sup> Cor. IV, ch 3<sup>rd</sup> &amp; 4th## verses.</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Lord was with us and<br/>
we were blessed. After I closed the Saints spake in<br/>
tongues and prophesied. Five presented themselves for<br/>
baptism which was administered unto them by Elder<br/>
[[John Edward Page|Page]] thus was added others to our number.</p>

<p>After an intermission Elder Page addressed<br/>
us upon the Priesthood and bore a strong testimony to<br/>
the people. Our Conference then closed by our returning<br/>
thanks to God.</p>

<p>We took the parting hand of many brethren<br/>
and sisters and I returned with several Elders to brother<br/>
Stodard's to spend the night.</p>

<p>At his house there was a woman presented<br/>
who was often possessed with the devil. She was oft times<br/>
dumb and greatly afflicted by evil spirits that dwelt in her.<br/>
She beleived in Jesus Christ of [[Nazareth, Israel|Nazareth]] and in us as his servants<br/>
and called upon us to cast the devil out of her.</p>

<p>According to this woman's request four of<br/>
us [[laying on of hands|laid our hands]] upon her and commanded the devil<br/>
in the name of Jesus Christ to depart out of her and<br/>
it was immediately done. The woman arose with great</p>",
42828.0,109,1837-06-12,"<p>joy and gave thanks and praise unto God; for according to her<br/>
faith she was made whole from that hour. A child also that was sick<br/>
was made whole by the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus<br/>
according to the words of the Lord. See ##Mark 16:17|Mark 16 ch, 17th verse##.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",06/12/1837

many other Saints and traveled in company of six other brethen to<br/>
the Branch of the Church in [[Leeds Township, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Leeds]].</p>

<p>We met together in the evening at brother [[Irvin B. Carnes|Carnes']] to<br/>
present ourselves before the Lord and b^e^are testimony of his work. Elders<br/>
[[John Goodson|John Go^o^dson]] [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|H Hale]] [[Milton Holmes|M. Holmes]] and [[John Snider|John Snider]] followed each<br/>
other in testimony and I testified next. The Spirit of God rested<br/>
upon us all.</p>

<p>I called upon sister Carnes to present before the Lord two<br/>
of her children who were sick, that we might [[administer to the sick|administer]] unto them<br/>
One was a sucking child and lay at the point of death. I took it in<br/>
my arms and presented it before the Elders who laid their hands upon<br/>
it while in my arms and we healed it in the name of Jesus Christ<br/>
I then returned it whole to its mother. The other child was<br/>
also healed; and the parents praised God for his goodness. I<br/>
spent the night at brother [[Brother Eaton|Eetons]].</p>

parted from Elder John Go^o^dson and Priests [[Isaac Russell|Isaac Russel]] and<br/>
John Snider. These brethren who had journeyed with us from<br/>
[[Canada, British North America|Canada]] were bound for the city of [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] to join two of the<br/>
Twelve who were to start for [[England|England]] on the 20th of June 1837<br/>

sister Eunice still employed teaching school. After a<br/>
short interview with Mr [[Alpha Sage|Alpha Sage]] I spend the remainder<br/>
of the day with Eunice whom I accompanied to her<br/>
school and spent a very interesting time. As the scene<br/>
and reflections of the time affected me much as well as</p>",
42828.0,111,,"<p>interesting me with the associations of home and family recolections<br/>
I will here give from my journal a discription written at the time of</p>

<p><u>My Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]]</u><br/>
<u>Teaching School.</u></p>

<p>I entered the [[Rock School, Colebrook, Litchfield County, Connecticut|school]] taught by my Sister Eunice at 1 o'clock<br/>
<strike>a</strike>^p^.m. Five hours I spent within its walls watching my sister<br/>
in the performance of her school duties and in perusing letters written<br/>
to her by my brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]]. Five years before when I last<br/>
beheld Eunice at our [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house she was only a child of twelve<br/>
years of age; but in the scene before me I now beheld her an<br/>
instructoress of youth. As I looked up^on^ her—my only sister<br/>
teaching the youth and showing accomplishments that grace the female<br/>
sex varied reflections passed through my mind and emotion of strong<br/>
affection moved me. There she appeared before me (only seventeen<br/>
years of age) adorned with youth modesty and loveliness</p>

<p>With a degree of admiration I gazed upon her and marked the<br/>
change five years had <strike>brought upon her</strike> ^produced^. Her spirit was ^blythe^ blithful<br/>
and her step as she moved among her pupils showed the energy<br/>
of youth</p>

<p>As if to call my mind more perfectly to the<br/>
recollections of home and past scenes Eunice with a cheerful grace<br/>
presented me with the bundle of letters from our brother Asahel<br/>
They were fifteen in number and addressed to my sister. As<br/>
I read them through they filled my soul with emotion and brought<br/>
as great a variety of feelings as the matter they contained. They<br/>
showed the cultivated mind and refined talents of a brother writing<br/>
to a sister with the purest spirit and deepest feeling for her<br/>
welfare. Such teachings as those to Eunice if followed by<br/>
the female youth would lead them by a thousand snares. The<br/>
name of Wilford was mentioned often. As I read I smiled and<br/>
wept &amp; in my heart said O God protect my brothers my sister<br/>
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and my parents.</p>

<p>I left the School with my sister and together<br/>
we viewed the [[Colebrook, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Colebrook]] landscapes as we walked along and conversed</p>",
42828.0,112,1837-06-29,"<p>of our brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] and of home and childhood's days.<br/>
Together we visited our parents' dwelling at Sage Mills but<br/>
they had gone to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]. Stumps and stones and house<br/>
and all looked natural. I went into the house but no<br/>
parent or brother was there but all was as silent as death<br/>
^I dropped a tear^ and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] plucked a rose as we left</p>

<p>From thence we went to [[Jonathan Stillman|Jonathan Stillmans]]<br/>
where we took supper after which Eunice and I parted<br/>
for the time and in company of brothers [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] and [[Dexter Stillman|Dexter <br/>
Stillman]] I preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the school<br/>
house in the evening and bore testimony unto the truth<br/>
of the Book of Mormon.</p>

meeting house and on the following <time datetime=""",06/30/1837
42828.0,112,1837-07-04,""">one</time> had an interview<br/>
with a Methodist priest who said that God had neither<br/>
body parts nor passions and that it was rediculous to<br/>
worship one who had. I continued preaching &amp;c during<br/>
the three succeeding days but nothing occurred that would<br/>
be interesting here.</p>

office directed to my father and sister I found two papers<br/>
from brother Asahel but no letters. Eunice had joined<br/>
a party to sail on the ^Doolittles^ pond. On my return<br/>
home I saw them cross the pond in the boat. I raised a<br/>
flag in token of friendship and they answered but did not know<br/>
me and as they passed my sight behind a grove I bowed<br/>
to them in silence and said to myself God save my sister</p>

<p>With brother Hale I took stage to [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New<br/>

uncle [[Adna Thompson Hart|^Adna^ H^art^s]] from thence to Woodford Mills built<br/>
and formerly owned by my father [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]]. Here I was</p>",

I was born and visited each appartment. The house and farm all<br/>
looked natural ^Bogue Hill^ not excepted. I called at Mr [[Henry Woodford|Henry Wood<strike>ruff's</strike>^ford^]]<br/>
and saw Mrs [[Huldah Andrus Woodford|Woodford]]. I also called upon Mr [[Horace Hillyear Judd|Judds]] Mrs [[Mary Wolcott Alling|Allens]] ^[[Zina Hart|Z]]^<br/>
and [[Obed Hart|O Harts]]. At [[Roger Woodford|Roger Woodfords]] I saw [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1812|Eldad W.]] and [[Lavilla Woodruff Day|Lavilla Day]].<br/>
I visited uncle [[Titus Woodruff|Titus Woodruff's]] family and saw [[Signora Caltha Woodruff Hurd|Caltha Herd]] at their<br/>
house. I called upon Capt [[Francis Woodruff|Francis Woodruff]] [[Erastus Woodruff|Erastus Woodruff]] and [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna]]<br/>
and C. ^Woodruff^ who were all glad to see me. I also visited uncle<br/>
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff's]] family. He was absent. I also saw many other friends.<br/>
During the walk I passed the school house in which I spent many of<br/>
my youthful days. I gazed upon it and upon the graveyard where<br/>
slept many of my progenators and friends. There was reposing also<br/>
the remains of my mother. I read the inscription on their toombstones<br/>
of several numbered with the dead who were well when I left<br/>
[[Connecticut|Connecticut]] in 1832. On the toombstone of my mother was<br/>
the following inscription:</p>

<p>A pleasing form a generous gentle heart<br/>
A good companion just without art<br/>
Just in her dealings faithful to her friends<br/>
Beloved through life lamented in the end.</p>

<p>My mother [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Bulah Thompson Woodruff]] was born in 1782<br/>
and died June the 11th 1808 aged 26 years. She was married<br/>
to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] Nov 29 1801 and by him had three children—<br/>
namely, [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] born Nov 29th 1802; [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Ozem Thompson]] born Dec<br/>

enraged against the truth and as soon as I closed he hurried himself<br/>
to the place where I stood and I was immediately surrounded by<br/>
the congregation. The priest said I had no right to enjoy my<br/>
opinion and he became angry and said many very inconsistant<br/>
things. The priest and people with very few exceptions rejected our<br/>
testimony. Afterwards brother Hale uncle Ozem and myself repaired<br/>
to the grove for prayer where we had a good time</p>

The people were addressed in an interesting discourse by [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]. In the afternoon<br/>
by Elder Wilford Woodruff who was followed by President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]</p>

<p>Next day the new year was celebrated by the usual<br/>
social manner. I delivered an address to the inhabitants of the Fourteenth<br/>
Ward in the forepart of the day and was followed by several others</p>

<p>In the evening I attended a party at the [[Social Hall, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Social Hall]]. The<br/>
time was mostly spent in music and dancing. We had however an<br/>
interesting address from President Brigham Young on</p>

<p>Dancing and Music</p>

<p>""I consider this a suitable place to give some instruction. We have<br/>
assembled here to have music and dancing. The world have had very strange<br/>
ideas concerning these things. They have supposed it was very wicked<br/>
for a Christian to dance or hear music. Many preachers of the day<br/>
have said that fidling and music came from hell; but I say there is<br/>
no fiddleing <strike>in</strike>or music in hell. There is not a fiddler in hell<br/>
nor any music of any kind. Music belongs to heaven to<br/>
cheer God angels and men. If we could hear the music there<br/>
is in heaven it would overwhelm mortal man</p>

<p>The Lord gave us that organ that makes<br/>
music so delightful to man and the Devil has stolen music and<br/>
many other things that was ordained of God for the benefit of man<br/>
and he has turned it to an evil use; but music and dancing<br/>
is for the benefit of the holy ones and if those who come here to<br/>
night are not holy and righteous and do not feel to worship and<br/>
praise God they have no business here</p>

<p>What strange ideas the world have of a Prophet<br/>
They would expect to see a man with finger nails a foot long<br/>
with his hair hanging to his hips his body covered with dirt and<br/>
filth his head bowed down ^in sorrow^ for the sins of the world and that</p>",
42828.0,115,1837-07-14,"<p>household beleived <strike>in</strike> the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness]] of the Everlasting Gospel and at the<br/>
same hour I led them forth and <s>p</s>baptized them for the [[remission of sins|remission<br/>
of their sins]]. There were three of them namely, my [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|uncle]] and his<br/>
wife [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah]] and their son [[John Woodruff|John]]. This was a fulfilment of a vision<br/>
given to me in 1818.</p>

<p>After baptizing them I walked in company of Elder<br/>
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] to [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]] to visit aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Cossetts]] household and was glad to<br/>
behold them face to face and to teach them the things of the kingdom<br/>
And On the next <time datetime=""",07/14/1837

in [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] and rode to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] where I found a letter<br/>
from my wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] in which she gave me the information that she<br/>
was on her way to Farmington.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",07/16/1837
42828.0,115,1837-07-20,""">Sunday</time> following I had the happy privilege of<br/>
meeting my wife. She came to attend our meeting at [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Harts]] in<br/>
Avon. My [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]] and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] accompanied her. At 5 p.m. I<br/>
preached to a congregation of relatives neighbours and former friends and<br/>
then returned to my father's at Farmington</p>

<p>I bid adieu to my father and [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]] on the <time datetime=""",07/20/1837

and also my sister Eunice. I then took stage with my wife and<br/>
rode with her to [[Hartford, Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford]] a distance of ten miles. She continued<br/>
her journey to her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]] in [[Maine|Maine]] by stage while I persued<br/>
it on foot. The reason why I did not go farther with her<br/>
by stage will be easily understood by those who are acquainted<br/>
with the history of the first Elders of the Church who like the<br/>
Apostles of old travelled and preached without purse or scrip<strike>t</strike><br/>
I had only sufficient money to pay my wife's fare and thus it was<br/>
that she continued her journey from Hartford per stage while<br/>
I did it on foot.</p>

<p>During the next three days I walked 136 miles. On <br/>
the <time datetime=""",07/21/1837

42828.0,115,,""">third</time> day which I accomplished<br/>
by about 5 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Here I will briefly relate an incident of my second day's<br/>
travel. Within a mile or two of [blank] I felt so weary and worn<br/>
out that ever^y^ step was made with painful effort. Just then a<br/>
gentleman came dashing along swiftly in his carriage. As he<br/>
was passing I prayed that he might be moved upon to take me up<br/>
The horse shot by me with swiftness to the distance of ^10 rods^<br/>
and then stop^p^ed and seemingly of his own accord as suddenly as though</p>",
42829.0,10,1854-01-22,"<p>he would not have a house or lie in one nor in a bed but in the caves <br/>
of the rocks and on the ground and must never smile or appear happy. <br/>
And as to seeing an Apostle the people would expect to melt if one came <br/>
along. But all of these ideas are vain and foolish; for this company before <br/>
me to night does not begin to be adorned inside or out as they should be <br/>
in order to meet with the angels <strike>of</strike>in heaven who are adorned in purity <br/>
power and glory clothed with clean white linen</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] will say a word concerning dancing with the <br/>
Gentiles. As I have got up this party if I had felt disposed <br/>
to have invited some Gentiles here would they have contaminated <br/>
me or this company? No; because the Priesthood rules here <br/>
with the keys of power truth light and knowledge; and I would not <br/>
suffer anything that is wrong for I would control things and have them <br/>
my own way or break up the party. But if any Elder in this <br/>
Church was to follow after Gentile parties they would submit <br/>
themselves to their spirit partake of their evils and go to the <br/>
devil. Any Elder would fall who pursued this course</p>

<p>Why do not the Gentile merchants of this <br/>
[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|City]] embrace this work? Because they have locked bolted and <br/>
bar[r]ed their minds against it with every lock they could put on. They <br/>
swore by every power they possess before they left home that they <br/>
would not embrace it. They came with but one object and that was <br/>
to gain money and they are determined not to be turned from <br/>
their purpose.""</p>

<p>Many other excellent remarks were made by <br/>
President Young.</p>

<p>On the third day I arrived at [[New Rowley, Essex County, Massachusetts|New Rowley]], Essex Co., Mass.,<br/>

<p>Soon after my arrival at bro [[Edward Milliken|E Milliken]] Elder Milton<br/>
Holmes also arrived bringing my wife with him. After dinner I<br/>
rode with Phebe to her father's, Mr. [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Ezra Carter]]. This was the first<br/>
time I ever saw any of my wife's family. It had been about one<br/>
year since Phebe left her father's house to go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]</p>

<p>When we arrived at the house we found Phebe's father<br/>
absent and her [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|mother]] confined to a bed of sickness: she had been<br/>
very low but was fast recovering. One of my wife's brothers was<br/>
at home and all her sisters. Two of her brothers were absent. <br/>
It was an affecting meeting and we were both joyfully received and<br/>
made welcome. During the evening father Carter came home &amp; <br/>
we all rejoiced exceedingly</p>

<p>In company with [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra]] and [[Joseph Fabyan Carter|F^abyan^ Carter]] I went<br/>
out in a fishing boat on the <time datetime=""",08/11/1837

at anchor and caught 250 fish such as cod haddock hake &amp;c<br/>
I also saw four whales. Two of them appeared in view at the same <br/>
time. This was the first time I ever saw a whale</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",08/18/1837
42828.0,116,,""">18th</time> I took the parting hand of my friends<br/>
in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] and leaving my wife at her father's I started with<br/>
Elder Hale to visit the Islands of the sea to preach the Gospel to those<br/>
who trade in ships. We arrived at [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]] in the evening where ^I^ saw<br/>
my brother-in-law Ezra Carter. The population of the place was about <br/>
16,000. The next day we took steam boat for the Islands called<br/>
[[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]] where after changing boats once we arrived at 2 o'clock in<br/>
the morning.</p>

<p>Having landed we called at [[Nathaniel Dyer|Nathaniel Dyers]] and retired<br/>
to rest. When we arose we made ourselves known as servants of God and<br/>
enquired concerning religious meetings in the place. It was the Sabbath<br/>
day and we learned that there was to be preaching in the Baptist meeting <br/>
house in the centre of the [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North Island]] which was part of [[Vinalhaven, Waldo County, Maine|Vinal Haven]].</p>",
42829.0,11,1854-02-02,"<p>[[Willard Richards|he]] suffered immensely and it seemed as though he was struggling in the agonies <br/>
of death. He had been sick several days. I spent the night with him <br/>
He suffered much during the night. The Presidency and Twelve administered <br/>
to him by the laying on of hands. We were almost fearful that he <br/>
would not recover from this sickness still we hoped.</p>

<p>I returned home in the morning, and Dr Richards <br/>
continued failing during the week</p>

<p>On the Sunday I attended with Dr Richards in <br/>
the forepart of the day. He suffered much. At the close of the <br/>
afternoon's meeting the Presidency and Twelve went to Dr Richards and <br/>
administered to him by the laying on <strike>i</strike>of hands and we had done it frequently <br/>
and had sometimes hopes of his recovery but all outward appearences had <br/>
been against h<strike>e'</strike>is getting up again.</p>

<p>After the evening's Ward meeting I went to Dr <br/>
Richard's and spent two hours with him. He was very low and to <br/>
all appearence would not live until the morning, but the next <br/>
morning he was alive and appeared somewhat better.</p>

<p>Next day also Dr Richards still lived and continued <br/>
better and there were many reasons to desire his recovery and to expect <br/>
it principally because the Twelve had administered to him many times <br/>
and exercized their power and faith in his behalf</p>

<p>I attended the Bishops meeting in the evening <br/>
with Elder [[Thomas Kington|Thomas Kington]]. I addressed the Bishops and had <br/>
the Spirit of the Lord. We were now beginning to ordain our <br/>
young sons to the lesser Priesthood here in Zion</p>

<p>We were gathering all our young children from <br/>
eight years old and upward in the several Wards, one evening in each <br/>
^week^ <strike>Ward</strike>  for the purpose of speaking and praying. I met with the children <br/>
in the Fourteenth Ward this evening and addressed them. I had <br/>
some fifty of them speak and it was an interesting time.</p>

pleasure. On the <time datetime=""",02/02/1854

with the Deacon of the Church and informed him that we were servants of God<br/>
He communicated the fact to the baptist priest by the name of [[Gideon J. Newton|Gideon J Newton]]<br/>
and also delivered to him our statement that we were servants of God <strike>Lord</strike> sent<br/>
with a message from him to the people and that we wished to be heard. Mr<br/>
Newton did not object and we were invited to the stand by him and he gave<br/>
out an appointment for us to preach at 5 o'clock p.m.</p>

<p>When he had closed his meeting he invited us home with<br/>
him and gave us some refreshments and we presented him with the [[Book of Mormon|Book of<br/>
Mormon]]. He was mild and said he would read it</p>

<p>In the evening Mr Newton accompanied us to the meeting<br/>
house where the congregation assembled at the appointed time. With peculiar<br/>
feelings I arose and addressed them from ##Galatians 1:9|Galations 1st ch and 9<sup>th</sup> verse##<br/>
This was the first time that I or any Elder of the Church to my knowledge<br/>
ever arose before the inhabitants of one of the Islands of the sea to preach to<br/>
them the [[fulness of the gospel|fu^l^lness]] of the Everlasting Gospel and the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>After I closed I gave out an appointment for each of<br/>
the four following evenings to be held in the several districts of [[North Fox Island, Waldo County, Maine|North<br/>

medecine near [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] the Book of Mormon which President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] <br/>
had left with his cousin [[Lucius Parker|Lucius Parker]] at [[Southborough, Worcester County, Massachusetts|Southborough]] providentially <br/>
fell in his way. He opened the book without regard to place and <br/>
totally ignorant of its design or contents and before reading half a <br/>
page said, ""God or the devil ^has^ had a hand in that book, for <br/>
man never wrote."" He read it twice through in about ten days <br/>
and became so convinced of the work of God that he resolved to close <br/>
his business and go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] to the Saints a distance of seven <br/>
hundred miles; but he was directly smitten with the pas^l^y [palsy] from <br/>
which he suffered greatly and which prevented the execution of his <br/>
design until October 1836 when he arrived in Kirtland in company <br/>
with his brother (Doctor [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] who attended him as a <br/>
physician) where he was warmly received by his cousin Brigham <br/>
Young with whom he tarried and gave the work a thorough <br/>
investigation.</p>

<p>On the 31st of December 1836 at the setting of <br/>
the sun Doctor Willard Richards was baptized at Kirtland under <br/>
the hands of President Brigham Young in the presence of [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. <br/>
Kimball]] and others who had spent the afternoon in cutting the <br/>
ice to prepare for the baptism.</p>

<p>He was chosen by revelation through <br/>
the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] in July 1838 to be ordained one of the Twelve Apostles <br/>
and was ordained accordingly at [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] England, while on a mission <br/>
to that [[England|country]] under the hands of the Twelve in their first council <br/>

in that dreadful hour and in the midst of the mob at [[Carthage Jail, Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] with <br/>
the mangled bodies of the martyrs and the care of Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] his letters <br/>

<p>In the Spring of 1847 he was enrolled in the <br/>
memorable Band of Pioneers under President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and in the Spring <br/>
of 1848 he was unanimously elected by the voice of the Church as <br/>
Second Councillor in the Presidency of the Church.</p>

<p>He was secretary in the State Government of Deseret <br/>
and President of the Council of the Legislative Assembly after our <br/>
Territorial Organization, besides being Postmaster for [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake <br/>
City]] up till his death and a member of the Perpetual Emigrating <br/>

<p>He was also the Editor and Proprietor of the Deseret <br/>
News from its origin and General Historian of the whole Church and <br/>
Church Recorder</p>

<p>I have travelled with brother Willard Richards both <br/>
in [[England|England]] and America many miles and we have been warm <br/>
associates many times. He was a great Counsellor in the <br/>
Church and I as well as the body of the Saints have received much <br/>
excellent Counsel from him. He was the first man who had <br/>
a natural death in the Church from the First Presidency or the <br/>
Twelve Apostles. All who had died of them before had been <br/>
martyred.</p>

in company with his brother [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] <br/>

<p>I spent the new year's day in visiting the<br/>
Saints and neighbours and found the solemnities of eternity<br/>
resting upon the people some crying ""What shall I do to be<br/>
saved."" In the afternoon I met a congregation at Capt [[Charles Brown|Charles<br/>

them. They were Capt Charles Brown and Capt [[Jesse Coombs|Jesse <br/>

the confirmation. After meeting^,^ in company of Mrs<br/>

the Universal Scientific Society in their annual meeting</p>

<p>Next Sunday I met with the quorum<br/>
of the Twelve and missionaries in the Seventies Hall and<br/>
ordained men to the ministry. There were over 100 set<br/>
apart by the laying on of hands to their various missions<br/>
among the Lamanites. This was done by the Twelve<br/>

house of our departed brother and President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] took <br/>
charge of the ceremony. President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] was not <br/>
able to be present with us.</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] made the prayer. He <br/>
prayed earnestly <strike>that</strike>for President Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball <br/>
and the person who should be chosen as Willard Richard's successor <br/>
also for the Twelve Apostles that they might prove true to their <br/>
integrity as brother Richards had done even unto the end. He <br/>
prayed for the wives and children of our lamented friend and brother <br/>
and that the Spirit of Willard might rest upon his oldest son <br/>
[[Heber John Richards|Heber John]] that he might stand at the head of his father's <br/>
house in dignity and honour. Elder [[George Darling Watt|Watt]] reported his prayer in <br/>
detail</p>

<p>At the close of the prayer the procession was formed. <br/>
Brother Kimball and Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] walked in front of the cor[p]se <br/>
and the Twelve Apostles walked by the side of it while his wives <br/>

behind them and as he was borne to his grave two bands played <br/>
a solemn death march.</p>

[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] delivered a short appropriate address and while his <br/>
remarks were being made the times which I had spent with <br/>
brother Richards in a foreign country came to my mind and <br/>
I felt solemn and lonesome under the reflection</p>

<p>After the burial I called upon the <br/>
family and conversed with them and then attended prayer <br/>
meeting with the Twleve; and with Brother Kimball and <br/>
[[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin Richards]] returned to Willard Richards family <br/>
and spent the evening with them and brother Kimball conversed <br/>
with them till 9 o'clock and gave them much counsel. He </p>",

<p>I met with the Presidency and Twelve in the House of the Lord<br/>
built upon the [[Salt Lake City Temple Block, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple Block]] and we dedicated it before the Lord. Brother<br/>
[[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]] opened by prayer and after the usual ceremonies [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>

his dedication prayer every room from top to botton; every wall and<br/>
the materials adobies sand clay stone lime, from the foundation to the<br/>
top and prayed that the Spirit of God might enter into it that it might<br/>
be clean sweet and holy and that no unclean thing might enter i<strike>t</strike>nto<br/>
it so that holy men women God and angels might visit this house<br/>
dedicated unto the Lord.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said he would name it<br/>
the House of God and when the [[Salt Lake City Temple, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]] is built he would call<br/>
it the Temple of our God.</p>

speaking when a canon or swivel was discharged near the house<br/>
on the sea shore followed quickly by a discharge of small arms<br/>
I arose, the Spirit of God rested upon me, and I declared the<br/>
word of God unto the people in great plainness while my words<br/>
were at times missed with the report of musketry outside the<br/>
house. I was plain in declaring the [[judgments|judgements]] of God, and<br/>
called upon the congregation to know if any wished to be baptised<br/>
when two arose and offered themselves for the ordinance.</p>

<p>The next <time datetime=""",01/16/1838
42828.0,124,1838-01-17,""">day</time> we met a company upon<br/>
the beach to attend to the ordinance of baptism. After<br/>
singing a hymn I led a man down into the water and<br/>
baptized him; and as on the night previous we were<br/>
saluted with the report of fire arms. From thence we<br/>
went to the east school house to hold a meeting which<br/>
was interupted by a mob. As soon as we began<br/>
they commenced to disturb us by walking across the house<br/>
and talking whistling singing dancing &amp;c. We were<br/>
forced to close in confusion</p>

death the same as they are now and in the same confu<strike>s</strike>sion and that there <br/>
would be head quarters of the gathering from which they would send out <br/>
missionaries to preach the Gospel to the Spirits in prison. Brother Kimball <br/>
advised the females to hold together and remain as they were on Brother [[Willard Richards|Willards]]<br/>

united together and assist each other all they could.</p>

<p>Views of President [[Brigham Young|Young]] on the Fall and Resurrection</p>

<p>He referred to the preaching of [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
the Sabbath before upon the subject of the resurrection. He said<br/>
the identicals particles of matter in which we had honored our spirits<br/>
<u>i.e.</u> our tabernacles in which we had suffered travelled labored and<br/>
built up the Kingdom of God they would be the identical bodies and<br/>
no other. They would be raised from the grave to immortality<br/>
and eternal lives</p>

<p>He said [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] and [[Eve (OT)|Eve]] had lived upon another<br/>
earth and were immortal when they came here. Adam assisted<br/>
in forming this earth and agreed to fall when he came here and he<br/>
fell that man might be; and the opposite principle to good—<br/>
the Devil the Serp<strike>a</strike>ent the Evil was placed upon the earth that<br/>
man might know the good from the evil for without an<br/>
experience in those things men could not know one from the<br/>
other.</p>

<p>As soon as the Devil was upon the earth he sowed<br/>
the seeds of death in everything; so that as soon as Adam<br/>
and Eve began to eat of the fruit of the earth they received<br/>
into their systems the seeds of mortality and of death. So<br/>
their children were mortal and subject to death sorrow and pain<br/>
who then when they partook of life joy ease and happiness<br/>
would know how to prise it. Father Adam would never<br/>
cease his labors to redeem his posterity and exalt them to all<br/>
the glory they were capable of receiving. He did not doubt<br/>
that Father Adam knew in the beginning how many<br/>
of his posterity would receive a celestial glory and who<br/>
they were and also of a terrestial and a telestial; yet man had</p>",

<p>President Young then arose and spoke upon the <br/>
death of  President [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and concerning filling his p[l]ace <br/>
in the Presidency. Upon this subject at the close of his discourse <br/>
the President said</p>

<p>""When the time comes to present before you the <br/>
quorums we shall probably supply the vacancy made by <br/>
the death of brother Willard Richards. Who will supply his </p>",

be rewarded according to his works.</p>

<p>[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] asked, ""Will ^[[Adam (OT)|Adam]]^ or any God continue to make<br/>
worlds people them and taste of death to redeem them?</p>

<p><u>Answer</u>: [[Brigham Young|I]] have no doubt that it is his privilege but<br/>
whether he will do it is a question in my mind</p>

coal mine. The vein was about 6 feet thick. It dipped to the<br/>

we brought some of it along with us. This coal bed was in<br/>
sight on both sides of the Kanyon and was about 10 miles<br/>

<p>We reached Fort Ephraim that night and held <br/>
a meeting. Presidents [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah M. Grant]]<br/>

42829.0,21,,"<p>place in the First Presidency? is a question that has not yet been answered though <br/>
many have talked to [[Brigham Young|me]] about it. I have asked the Twelve to dictate this <br/>
part of the business but they have thrown it back. Well I will say where <br/>
it ought to be. They said it was not their place to dictate the affair <br/>
but to confirm the conclusions of the President. If the Conference will <br/>
show the best method of knowing who is the best man to be my <br/>
Second Counsillor I will readily listen to their wisdom. The Twelve <br/>
would have nothing to do with it but said it was the privilege of <br/>
the President to choose his own Counsellor and for them to run the <br/>
risk of its being right or wrong. However if the Conference wish <br/>
to dictate this matter I will give them an opportunity. That is <br/>
my method of doing business; as long as we are of one heart <br/>
and of one mind there is no ground for discord or dissension.""</p>

<p>The President also spoke upon the subject of <br/>
appointing new gathering places designing to establish three or four <br/>
new locations for this purpose East and West especially ^for^ the emigration <br/>
from [[Europe|Europe]]</p>

<p>The subject of consecration came up the next <br/>
day. Touching the matter President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] said that <br/>
what President Young had presented to the people to carry out <br/>

<p>Mr [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Ebenezer Carver]] had been earnestly<br/>
investigating the Gospel and while desiring to know the<br/>
truth of it he walked towards the sea shore and desiring<br/>
that he might have some signs. But the word of God<br/>
upon which he was meditating was that there should be<br/>
no sign given but the sign of the Prophet [[Jonah (OT)|Jonas]] [##Matthew 12:39##]</p>

<p>On a sudden there was a large fish arose<br/>
on the water in the sea at a distance from him and<br/>
it as suddenly sunk out of sight. He desired again<br/>
to see it and immediately the fish arose a second<br/>
time upon the top of the water accompanied by another<br/>
fish of the same species and size. One of them swam<br/>
in a straight line on the top of the water towards Mr<br/>
Carver as he stood upon the beach. When the fish<br/>
came as near his feet as the water would permit<br/>
it looked at the man with a penetrating eye as though<br/>
it had a message for him. The fish then returned<br/>
to its mate and swam out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr Carver returned home meditating upon<br/>
the strange sight. It is worthy of remark that this<br/>
took place at a time of the year when fish of that<br/>
size is not known upon these shores and they never<br/>
at any season come ashore as in this case. Thus I<br/>
was informed and Mr Carver had dreams confirming that<br/>
it was a sign to him.</p>

<p>Two days later, <time datetime=""",04/01/1838
42828.0,128,,""">April 1st</time> I preached to<br/>
a large congregation at Mr Carver's and after the meeting<br/>
baptized his [[Mary Stinson Carver|wife]] where the fish came to him. Many<br/>
were beleiving.</p>

<p>But about this time [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]]<br/>

was now cut off from the Church wrote to the [[John Kent|Post-<br/>

through the [[Utah Territorial Statehouse, Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|building]] and the sides were divided into three rooms each, the<br/>
upper story was to be finished into one room or hall. The basement<br/>
story wall was three feet thick and the remainder of the building 2 feet<br/>

shingled.</p>

<p>All the way from [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] on our journey<br/>

we journeyed to [[Corn Creek, Millard County, Utah Territory|Corn Creek]] which contained a settlement of Indians<br/>
of the <strike>Parvaosts</strike> ^Parvants^. [[Chief Kanosh|David Ka<strike>a</strike>nosh Tashobets]] was their<br/>
principal Chief</p>

<p>We stoped a short time with the Indians and<br/>
about a dozen of them with their chiefs mounted their horses and<br/>
rode with us on our journey. The Indians shot prarie dogs<br/>
and rabbits for their supper. They roasted the dogs a little and then<br/>
eat them entrails young ones and all. We camped at Co<strike>ve</strike>^rn^ Creek<br/>
after a distance of 40 miles travel during the day.</p>

<p>Two days later we reached [[Parowan, Iron County, Utah Territory|Parowan]]. Here<br/>
we met [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and visited his flouring mill which<br/>
was a good establishment</p>

addressed the people. I was not in at the commencement and had <br/>
no chance of reporting his discourse. The following is a key to his <br/>
address which I have written from memory</p>

<p><u>Synopsis of a Discourse of President Young</u>.</p>

<p>""I do not wish to spend my time neither is it profitable for <br/>
any man to spend his time in telling the people what was done in <br/>
the days of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] [[Enoch (OT)|Enoch]] and [[Noah (OT)|Noah]] thousands of years ago but my <br/>
business is to tell the people what they should do to day in order to <br/>
be saved. This is my doctrine all the time. What can I do <br/>
or this people do to-day in any one thing in order to build up the <br/>
kingdom of God or to advance any step farther towards the salvation</p>",

public and was for that reason addressed to the [[John Kent|Postmaster]]. It<br/>
was read by the people beleived by many and used by our<br/>
opposers causing persecution to rage. The letter was also handed<br/>
to me by the Postmaster to read.</p>

<p>It might be here stated that [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]]<br/>
fell through disappointed ambition. He aspired to the<br/>
quorum of the Twelve or to be a leading spirit of the<br/>
Church. He was what is termed a smart man and<br/>
through his smartness distorted by ambition and envy<br/>
and the bitterness thereof he turned against [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and<br/>
the Church, having fallen into darkness and given himself<br/>
up to the power of Satan</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the letter of Warren Parrish<br/>
and the opposition which we met we continued to increase<br/>
our numbers. On the <time datetime=""",04/07/1838

sickness by the imposition of hands. I then walked<br/>
to Mr [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Ebenezer Carver's]] and preached to the people and<br/>
afterwards preached ^baptised^ Mrs [[Abigail Waterman Carver|Abigal Carver]]. She was over<br/>
70 years of age and had not been to a neighbour's house<br/>

spirit to the sea shore and was baptized and returned<br/>

stones. They had 145 buildings and very good ones for the time the<br/>
place had been settled. There was also a tithing office 43 by<br/>

cost 25 hundred dollars. The main portion of the building was<br/>
not finished. They had a meeting house 60 by 25 feet and<br/>
had three schools during the Winter two men schools and one<br/>

<p>Now what has been the coun<strike>ci</strike>sel to this people for several years <br/>
past? It has been to ^build^ f^or^t^s^ <strike>up</strike>; to wall in your cities with strong walls <br/>
This has been the voice of the Lord unto them all the day long. Have the <br/>
people listened to this voice? Have they carried out this counsel? No <br/>
they have not? But what have they done? They have been ready to say <br/>
what nead hath the Lord of this thing? Do you <strike>real</strike>think there is any danger <br/>
of the Indians? Do you think that brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] really believes that <br/>
it is necessary to go to so much expence in building walls around our cities?<br/>
Instead of going to work and doing what they are told to do the people <br/>
spend their time in talking about it and trying to evade it.</p>

<p>Now I wish to ask a question. The Lord has appointed <br/>
me to lead this people. The people have chosen me as their leader <br/>
and covenanted to sustain me and obey my counsel. Now if I tell <br/>
the people what to do and they do not do it nor carry out my counsel <br/>
but turn from it and go to work and do something else and they continue <br/>
this year after year while at the same time I am warning them of <br/>
the danger of their course and telling them of the judgements which will <br/>
come upon them if they do not alter their course and go to work and <br/>
do as I have told them do you suppose they will escape the chastening <br/>
rod of the Almighty? No they will not.</p>

<p>If the people continue to pursue their present<br/>
course and the chastening rod does not fall upon their heads I should <br/>
become disregarded in the sight of God angels and men. This people <br/>
may rest assured that they are preparing a rod for their ^own^ backs if they <br/>
do not listen to my counsel and do what I tell them</p>

<p>But says one I would go to work and help build <br/>
a wall around the city if I knew it was a revelation from God and <br/>
that it was His will we should do it. I want to say to such that <br/>
it is my will that you should do it and that it is enough. I am <br/>
responsible for it and if you want to know any farther about <br/>
it do right. Pray unto the Lord and have faith before him that <br/>
you may have visions and revelations from God so that you </p>",

<p>Fort Harmony was two hundred <strike>rods</strike> ^feet^ square the wall<br/>
eight feet high, and when finished it was designed to be 22 feet<br/>
high forming one wall for two story buildings. The foundation<br/>
was stone and the remainder adobies. The first story was<br/>
three feet thick and the 2nd story to be two feet. The fort contained<br/>
42 rooms on the ground 15 by 16. There were 40 families and<br/>
260 persons. They had one meeting house 26 by 16 a <strike>a</strike>tithing house<br/>
20 by 15 and a guard House 12 by 16. One female school was<br/>
kept; there was one public well in the Fort 86 feet deep<br/>
stoned-up and good water. They had a field of 500 acres<br/>
one half of it fenced and sown with wheat. They had but<br/>
one gate to their Fort which was to be 10 by 12 feet and one foot<br/>
thick strongly hung and could not be opened from the outside<br/>
One woman on the inside could shut it but it takes several men <br/>
to open it. They had made a farm for the Indians of<br/>
fifty acres and 25 was then in wheat. They had made a good<br/>
road from Fort Harmony to [[Fort Walker, Iron County, Utah Territory|Fort Walker]]. One straight line of<br/>

to be saved to-day for if you get out of the path of salvation to day <br/>
you are in danger of being out of it to-morrow and the farther you <br/>
stray from it the more difficulty you will meet in ever finding <br/>
it again</p>

from those paths that would lead to those glories</p>

farms horses cattle goods gold and riches. The possessor says I <br/>
look upon them; I say these are mine. At the same time <br/>
you do not once think that there is not one thing in your possession <br/>
that is yours. It all belongs to God; and even you yourselves <br/>
belong to God. All you have belong[s] to Him and He has <br/>

<p><u>Address By President Young</u></p>

<p>President Young arose and said:</p>

<p>""I am not in the habit of taking a <br/>
text but I will now take for my text the last lines that were sung: ""God <br/>
is his own interpreter and he will make it plain.""</p>

<p>But do the people understand those things which are <br/>
for our good? The Lord will not explain all things unto us. He <br/>
understands; but he will make his people walk by faith. He will <br/>
not explain all his mysteries to the people. We read in the ##JST, Hebrews 11:1|New <br/>
Testament## that faith is the assurance of things hoped for—the evidence <br/>
of things not seen.</p>

<p>Have we all got faith? It is our duty to have faith <br/>
in God and his word and promise. You have to trust in God. <br/>
He will not reveal all things unto us</p>

<p>Some men are tried with the counsel given and <br/>
will not obey. They will not have glory in the Kingdom of God <br/>
They are bastards and not sons. The Lord intends for the people <br/>
to be tried so as to prove the faithful. What God does reveal he <br/>
reveals for the purpose of leading men in the way of salvation</p>

<p>The people do not know the way of the Lord <br/>
They come here and say I am going to build myself up. I have to <br/>
work so hard I cannot get time to pray. But are you doing right <br/>
when you do this? We may labour to get all things about us yet <br/>
the Lord will control it as seemeth him good</p>

<p>If you get into the dark still hold on to <br/>
the work of God. No matter if I don't feel like praying I </p>",

me to enter the room where brother [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] was confined<br/>
At this time we were strangers after the flesh but related<br/>
in the Gospel. This was the first time I had ever<br/>
visited an^y^ <strike>Elder</strike> ^one^ in prison.</p>

<p>After the keeper had turned the key upon<br/>
us and left us together I began to enquire into the<br/>
state of his mind and found him strong in the<br/>
faith. He had the Bible Book of Mormon [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley's]]<br/>
[[A Voice of Warning|Voice of Warning]] and the [[The Evening and The Morning Star|Evening and Morning Star]]<br/>
as his companions which he constantly read</p>

<p>We conversed together about three hours and he<br/>
informed me of many things that had transpired while<br/>
there. Among the variety he mentioned the goal taking<br/>
fire a few days before my visit. He said this looked<br/>
like a dark hour. The fire was roaring over his head<br/>
while a scene of uproar confusion and distress was<br/>
upon every hand; the engines were rapidly playing around<br/>
the building water poured into every room the people<br/>
hallooing in the streets the prisoners crying for mercy<br/>
to be let out lest they should be consumed one of the<br/>
number was struggling in the agonies of death while<br/>
others were cursing swearing &amp;c. He said he felt composed<br/>
through the confused scene until the fire was extinguished</p>

<p>Bro Rockwood was writing his life while<br/>
in confinement; and he sent a roll of the same by<br/>
me to his [[Nancy Haven Rockwood|wife]] in [[Holliston, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Holliston]].</p>

<p>At half past 8 o'clock p.m. the jailor came<br/>
and unlocked the prison doors and I left brother R. in<br/>
spirits and bent my way back to the city of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]]<br/>
When crossing the long bridge on my return I heard the<br/>
cry of fire the ringing<s>s</s> of bells and the ratling of engines<br/>

it was extinguished</p>

<p>If the Lord should open the vision ^of the minds^ of the people who have <br/>
gone to [[California|California]] so that they could see things as they are they would <br/>
as soon cut their throats as to have done it. But they dont see it: they <br/>
have to go and suffer until they are satisfied</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] will say the same to this people. If we do <br/>
not the things which God requires we shall be whiped until we are <br/>
sore. This is the only thing that will save us. I now tell you <br/>
that those who are gone and are going to California without counsel <br/>
will have it till they are sore</p>

<p>I know the truth but I cannot tell it all <br/>
to you until God permits me to do it. Now if you have not <br/>
confidence in me to follow me and believe that I am doing right drop <br/>
me and appoint another and I will follow in the wake</p>

<p>In the beginning of this work God tried to <br/>
get this people to be one but they would not be one. I will tell <br/>
you what to do. God intends to make you one. You must be <br/>
one and there must be a beginning to this. And you must begin <br/>
in small things like children making cob houses.</p>

<p>The people went to [[Missouri|Missouri]] and there <br/>
they quarrelled about many small matters. Then God said I <br/>
will throw down their good houses; and God drove ^all the people^ out and then <br/>
they were knocked into pi. Did they do any better then? No <br/>
they did not. God tries his people both with riches and with poverty <br/>
If I <strike>will</strike> ^am^ <strike>be</strike> faithful in my poverty I <strike>will</strike> ^shall^ own all riches that is <br/>
neadful.</p>

<p>Now God wants us to be of one heart and one mind <br/>
He may have no other motive than to make us work together. He <br/>
will tell us to build fences and forts that our feelings and interests <br/>
may be united in something. Now will you do it? We are <br/>
required to become of one heart and mind and work together in these <br/>
little things that we do understand or else we could not be prepared <br/>
to work together and be one in those eternal things which we do not </p>",

<p>It is not my place to get up to reveal anything for it is the head <br/>
to convey it to the body; but it is for me to carry out his designs <br/>
and do his will; for when I do the will of President Young I do the <br/>
will of God and no man can get salvation unless he keeps his counsel <br/>
It is his will that the city should be walled and fortified and that is <br/>
my will. When I do just as he tells me I do the will of my <br/>
father in heaven for he is the only man who holds the keys of salvation.<br/>
When I feel reluctant to do his will I feel bad and so do you all <br/>
When I do his will I can sleep in peace and my heart is consoled <br/>
all the day long. This is also the case with you when you <br/>
do as the [[Henson Walker Jr.|Bishop]] tells you. Last year your improvements <br/>
were all scattered about but now you are got into a smashed <br/>
suckertash pie. Now go to and save yourselves against all selfishness <br/>
I am going to put my property and all my wives into the Church—<br/>
and then nothing can be taken out of the Church. I am going <br/>
to dedicate all I have to God</p>

of God; and for more than 20 years a numerous circle<br/>
of friends had made his case a subject of prayer and<br/>
pled with the Lord in his behalf. But as often as<br/>
my father had struggled for victory Satan had hindered<br/>
him and gained the <strike>victory</strike> ^mastery^.</p>",
42829.0,71,1855-06-30,"<p>The Indian [[Chief Arrowpene|Chief]] made a short but spirited address which was<br/>
interpreted by brother [[Dimick Baker Huntington|Huntington]]. The purport of his address was an<br/>
exhortation to the people to give heed to the counsel of President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
If they would do this and keep the Spirit of the Lord he said they <br/>
would not be sick and die as the wicked do but they would be healthy<br/>
The Lord is giving you great blessings in food and rament oxen cows<br/>
and horses and you should be faithful and thankful.</p>

42828.0,136,1838-07-01,"<p>Since I had became a member of the Church of<br/>
Latter-day Saints and entered into the [[new and everlasting covenant|New and Everlasting<br/>
Covenant]] with a Dispensation of the Gospel committed<br/>
unto me I had felt a deeper interest than ever in<br/>
the salvation of my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]. I had now come to<br/>
declare a message unto him and his household and to<br/>
teach them words whereby they might be saved.</p>

<p>I began to cry unto the Lord for my<br/>
father and family and the Lord showed me in a<br/>
night vision that a great victory was nigh.</p>

<p>But the Devil fell upon the whole household<br/>
with great wrath and temptation. Some of the time<br/>
one was ready to fall back and then another and<br/>
his power also rested upon me as if to devour me<br/>
but after being confined to my bed for several hours<br/>
under his grasp in the name of Jesus I with my<br/>
friends burst the powers of darkness.</p>

<p>I went and stood before the people and<br/>
preached the Gospel and the Lord gave us the victory<br/>
and the time had come for the fulfilment of that part<br/>
relating to <strike>relatives</strike> ^my family^ obeying the Gospel spoken in my [[patriarchal blessing|Patriarchal<br/>
Blessing]] under the hands of the Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph]].</p>

<p>I then assembled them upon the bank of<br/>
[[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]] and led six of my friends into the<br/>
waters of baptism. They were my Father [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother]] my Sister<br/>
[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] Aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna Cossett]] &amp; cousin [[Seth Woodruff|Seth]] and Mr [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]] a<br/>
Methodist Class leader. The following was written at the time<br/>
in a special page of my journal to ma[r]k this important<br/>
event in the history of myself and family:</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] preached upon the subject<br/>
of the Lamanites and told the Latter day Saints plainly their<br/>
duty towards them.</p>

<p>An Indian Chief called [[Chief High Forehead|High for^e^head]]<br/>
followed President Young and spoke in a very interesting manner<br/>
Others also preached during the day</p>

<p>President Young and his Council tried to have <br/>
a talk with Walker. At first he appeared dogish and was not<br/>
disposed to talk. When we first formed our corrall within 40 <br/>
rods of his camp he gathered all his warriors and made quite a display <br/>
but we did not go out to meet them at the time and they turned their <br/>
horses out and went into their tents.</p>

<p>When we called upon Walker he laid down <br/>
in the dirt and did not feel disposed to talk; but Brother <br/>
Young manifested great patience with him even after the patience <br/>
of most men would have been exhausted. He went to him and <br/>
lifted him out of the dirt and finally got him to talk some. The <br/>
following is a Synopsis of the conversation with Walker</p>

<p>He said he had no spirit. He had no heart. Did <br/>
not feel as though he could talk. ""And when I heard that President <br/>
Young was coming I felt that I had no heart. I do not want to <br/>
talk. I want to hear President Young talk and then sit still <br/>
and hear others talk.</p>

<p>President Young gave him some tobac<strike>o</strike>co. he <br/>
said when he had plenty of tobacco than all his friends would <br/>
come in and smoke with him but when he was out of tobacco <br/>
they would not come to see him</p>

<p>Governor Young said I have brought some beef <br/>
cattle for you. I want one killed so that you can have </p>",
42828.0,137,,"<p>into the New Covenant with me. Without shame I have declared<br/>
the Gospel to them. They felt that God had sent me and that<br/>
they must obey.</p>

<p>The day had come. From my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house I<br/>
and my friends started to the appointed place, bending our way towards the<br/>
river to attend to the sacred ordinance of baptism. The spot<br/>
was reached! We stood upon the [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|river's]] bank! Nature spread her<br/>
fields of pleasing green and the Sun shed forth his golden<br/>
rays to gladden the earth while the silver stream was rolling<br/>
at my feet and seemed to say I am ready for the Master's<br/>
service.</p>

<p>With feelings better imagined than described<br/>
I dwelt upon the scene and cast my eyes upon the audience<br/>
while we sung praises to the God of Israel</p>

<p>Who would not have bowed the knee<br/>
while offering the sacrifice of the heart and imploring the<br/>
blessing of Heaven that the Spirit might pervade the waters<br/>
and rest upon the candidates?</p>

<p>As from our knees we arose I entered<br/>
the watery element and asked who was ashamed of the bed<br/>
where Jesus lay. Many eyes were turned to behold the<br/>
scene as my father followed me into the water and deep<br/>
solemnity rested upon their countenances.</p>

<p>I took my father by the hand while he<br/>
covenanted to walk with God; and for the [[remission of sins|remission of his sins]]<br/>
I baptized him. Feeling the victory won, my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]] followed<br/>
his footsteps.</p>

<p>[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] my sister my only sister was ready. The<br/>
garb of pride had been rent and now fearless of the world's despising<br/>
she next entered the waters of baptism and thus followed her<br/>
Divine Master.</p>

<p>For the consolation of Israel Aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna]] had<br/>
long looked and now she rejoiced that she could the ancient path<br/>
persue while upon her example and upon the holy scene her<br/>
young daughters gazed and seemed to say O Lord prepare us likewise<br/>
to do thy will.</p>

<p>[[Seth Woodruff|Seth]] in his early youth was not too young to<br/>
serve his God and he desired to follow the example of his<br/>
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|father]] [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|mother]] and [[John Woodruff|brother]] whom I baptized a year before.</p>",

those who would be crowned as Gods and be able to endure the fulness<br/>

servants for whom they would be held responsible. All others would<br/>
have to inherit another kingdom even that kingdom agreeing to the laws<br/>
which they had kept. Yet he thought these also would have the<br/>
privilege of proving themselves worthy and advancing to a celestial glory<br/>

there is any one here that can give me the Spirit of the Lord I wish <br/>
they would do it. He said white people in heaven were happy.</p>

<p><u>[[Tulpidge|Tulpidge]]</u> next spoke amid much crying and tears <br/>

did not wish to talk and he left his tent and went into the <br/>

they wished the Elders to lay hands up it. Then President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] Benson<br/>
and [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] laid hands upon it and administered to it. Dr [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Sprague]]<br/>
also left some medicine for it and for others who were sick</p>

<p>The Indian said if the child died he should <br/>
have to kill an Indian child or a Mormon child to go with it. (This <br/>
is their tradition). The interpreter told him he must not do it—that <br/>
it was wrong; that when Mormon children died we did not <br/>
kill any child to go with them and they must not do it for <br/>
it was not right. The Indian said his heart was not <br/>
so. He wanted to kill some one to go with him. He said <br/>

in keeping a history of the journey</p>

<p>Next day we reached [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|Filmore City]] <br/>
a distance of 35 miles from the Severe and we had hail and <br/>
rain storms all day.</p>",
42828.0,139,,"<p>and viewed the river and pleasant fields and partook of some buries<br/>
by the way side. This was my last walk with my [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] at<br/>
this ^time^ for on the morrow I left [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] for my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife's]] [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]]</p>

<p>After evening prayers [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] retired to rest and I<br/>
spent a season in conversation with [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]]. We felt sensibly the<br/>
weight of the powers of temptation that try the souls of men<br/>
but out of which the Lord delivers his Saints. I also spent<br/>
a short time with sister Eunice before retiring and we mingled<br/>
our sympathies tears and prayers together before a throne<br/>
of grace.</p>

<p>I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep and<br/>
after once more partaking of the bounties of earth around the<br/>
family and bowing before the Lord and offering up our<br/>
morning  sacrifice I took the parting hand of my father<br/>
mother and sister Eunice and once more bid adieu to my<br/>
native place.</p>

<p>I arrived in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on the 5th and took<br/>
the steam boat Portland at 7 p. m. and started for the city<br/>
of [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]. In the morning we saw a Spanish flag of<br/>
distress at sea. We approached her and found her to be the<br/>
wreck of a Spanish brig. They had been wrecked about 10 days<br/>
but all the crew was on board and no lives lost. We<br/>
towed her into Portland.</p>

<p>We arrived at 8 a. m. and after taking<br/>
breakfast with my brother-in-law [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra Carter]] I visited<br/>
some book stores and purchased an Album for Mrs<br/>
Woodruff.</p>

<p>I then walked to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] and had<br/>
the pleasure of again greeting my wife and friends in<br/>
peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>Some days after this I received an<br/>
interesting letter from Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan Hale]] in which<br/>
he stated that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] was in [[Missouri|Missouri]] and receiving<br/>
the word of the Lord daily</p>

<p>President Young preached in the morning and was followed<br/>
by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]; and in the afternoon Elder [[Nathaniel V. Jones|Nathaniel V Jones]] from<br/>
the Presidency of the Hindostan and Burman empire mission related<br/>
his travels in those lands. He said that the Elders of the Church had<br/>
travelled from the [[Himalayas, Asia|Himalaya Mountains]] to near the Southern limits of the <br/>
Peninsula and that a Mr Wilson Episcopalian Bishop of [[Calcutta, British India|Calcutta]] wrote<br/>
to the clergy in all the military cantonments to forbid the Elders preaching<br/>

the evening [[Chief Walker|Walker]] the Indian Chief [[Dimick Baker Huntington|D. Huntington]] Brigham Young <br/>
and myself went into the hill among the Ceders and through a spy glass <br/>
viewed the country around. I also went on to the ceder heights <br/>
with T. Bullock and [[Phineas Howe Young|Phineas Young]] and viewed the country. We <br/>
had prayers together</p>

<p>Phineas Young said that he was ^the first^ chosen in the <br/>
organization of the first quorum of the Twelve Apostles but brother <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said he wished I would let [[William Smith|W<u>m</u> Smith]] have that place so I <br/>
gave way to him. This is not true</p>

<p>On our next day's journey we met brother [[Enoch Reese|Enoch <br/>

<p>We camped for the night on Bever Creek. I caught a <br/>
fine trout and gave it to President Young; but he said he <br/>
would not take it unless I came and took breakfast with him <br/>
which I agreed to do</p>

<p>We reached [[Parowan, Iron County, Utah Territory|Parowan]] next evening and the <br/>

with the birth of a fine [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|daughter]]. She was born at<br/>

remained with her until the 30th a portion of the time<br/>
engaged in manual labour.</p>

<p>On this day I started for the Islands again and<br/>
arrived there on the 7th of August. Here on the 9<sup>th</sup><br/>
I was presented with the following letter from President<br/>
[[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B. Marsh]]:</p>

<p>Called to the Twelve</p>

<p>(A copy of a letter written by Thomas B. Marsh to Wilford Woodruff)</p>

<p>[[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], July 14th 1838.</p>

<p>Elder Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>A few days since President <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith Jun]] and some others were assembled<br/>
to attend to some Church business when it was thought<br/>
proper to select those who were designed of the Lord to<br/>
fill the places of those of the Twelve who had fallen<br/>
away namely [[William Earl McLellin|Wm. E. Mc Lellin]] [[Lyman Eugene Johnson|Lyman E. Johnson]]<br/>
[[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] and [[John Farnham Boynton|John F Bointon]]. The persons<br/>
selected were [[John Edward Page|John E Page]], [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] Wilford Woodruff<br/>
and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]].</p>

<p>On the following day five of the Twelve with<br/>
President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] and some others met and resolved that<br/>
President Rigdon wrte to Brother Richards who is now in<br/>
[[England|England]] and inform him of his appointment and that<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] write to [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and inform him that<br/>
the Lord has commanded that the Twelve assemble <strike>in<br/>
this place</strike> in this place as soon as possible and that<br/>
I should write to yourself.</p>",
42829.0,36,,"<p>and [[Francis Tufts Whitney|F T. Whitney]] I rode horseback to [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Cedar City]] 20 miles and on <br/>
our arrival I went to the Iron Works and examined all the premises <br/>
and saw several pigs of native iron. [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] explained to <br/>
me the difficulties they had to encounter in making iron which I <br/>
found to be many. We held a meeting in the ^evening^ President <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] preached and I reported his discourse. It is in the <br/>
[[Historian|Historian's Office]]</p>

<p>Next day again in company with brothers [[John Steele|Steel]] <br/>
and Whitney I rode 6 miles to Summit Creek. The previous <br/>
Summer there were 12 houses here which were removed during <br/>
the Indian war but the fort was standing. From thence <br/>
we rode 6 miles farther to the Summit of the [[Great Basin|Great Basin]] and <br/>
then 7 miles farther to Battle Creek.</p>

<p>Here we had splendid mountain senery <br/>
of red rocks standing like pyramids 1000 feet high. Opposite <br/>
this cite was <strike>a</strike> [[Fort Harmony, Washington County, Utah Territory|<strike>f</strike>Fort Harmony]] to be located 6 miles from the <br/>
base of the mountain on the East, the fort on the West. We <br/>
then rode to the present location of Fort Harmony which by the <br/>
rodeometer was 287 miles from [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]]</p>

<p>This was a good grazing country and <br/>
splendid mountain Scenery. The brethren were trying <br/>
to take out the stream of water called Ash Creek to water <br/>
their farming land. They had carried it 6 miles and <br/>
had to carry it <strike>6</strike>2 miles farther to carry it on to their new <br/>
field which they were making. The missionaries who <br/>
were sent out the last Winter from Salt Lake had done<br/>
this. [[Rufus Chester Allen|Rufus Allen]] was their captain. [[John Doyle Lee|John D. Lee]] <br/>
had the charge of their old fort.</p>

<p>Fort Harmony was 15 miles from <br/>
the [[Virgin River, United States|Rio Virgin]]</p>

<p>I went fishing but caught nothing though <br/>
it was said there were some small trout in the Creek</p>",
42829.0,77,1855-10-17,"<p>The missionaries were appointed to their respective Districts and<br/>
the Conferences arranged: Conference at [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]] on the 26th of October for the<br/>
First District. In the Second District first quarterly Conference on the<br/>
3rd of November at [[Manti, Sanpete County, Utah Territory |Manti City]]. Third District Conference on the 9th<br/>
of Nov at [[Parowan, Iron County, Utah Territory|Parowan]]. Fourth District Conference at [[Farmington, Davis County, Utah Territory|Farmington]] on<br/>

Sixth District; 1st quarterly Conference 10th Nov. at [[Tooele, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Tooele City]].</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff was appointed to draft the minutes of <br/>
the meeting and present them to the Editor of the Deseret News. They<br/>
will be found in full in ^the^ No. for <time datetime=""",10/17/1855
42829.0,77,1855-10-20,""">October 17th</time> th.</p>

<p>About this date the Indians began to be hostile again<br/>
At the Elk Mountain Mission they had shot three of the brethren<br/>
namely [[Wiseman Hunt|Wiseman Hunt]] [[William Behunin|Wm <strike>Be<strike>a</strike>hhnin</strike> ^Behannan^]] and [[Edward Edwards|Edward Edw^ards^]]<br/>
and they had broken up the mission. They were als^o^ making<br/>
disturbances at Green River Mission</p>

<p>In company with Elder [[Thomas Kington|T. Kington]] I rode<br/>
to Farmington Davis County to attend the quarterly Conference<br/>
of that District to commence on the <time datetime=""",10/20/1855
42829.0,77,,""">20th</time></p>

<p>After retiring to bed I prayed to the Lord<br/>
to show me what we should teach the people and I received<br/>
for an answer, ""Let my servants obtain the Holy Ghost and keep<br/>
my Spirit with them and that will instruct them what to teach<br/>
the people continually. Instruct the people to keep my Spirit<br/>
with them and they will be enabled to understand the word of the<br/>
Lord when it is taught them</p>

<p>Quarterly Conference</p>

<p>At Farmington<br/>
October the 20th 1855.</p>

<p>Saturday morning at 10 o'clock the people in the 1st District</p>",
42828.0,141,,"<p>Know then Brother Woodruff by this that you are appointed<br/>
to fill the place of one of the Twelve Apostles and that it is<br/>
agreeable to the word of the Lord given very lately that you should<br/>
come spedily to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] and on the 26th of April next to take<br/>
your leave of the Saints here and depart for other climes across<br/>
the mighty deep!</p>

<p>Yours in the love of God<br/>
[[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B. Marsh]].</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the threats of the people to mob tar<br/>
feather and kill me if I came there again I was determined<br/>
to visit once more the Saints upon the Islands of the Sea<br/>
The next few days was occuppied in carrying out this design<br/>
I also had a short interview with Mr [[William Stuart Douglass|Douglass]] the Methodist<br/>
Priest and his countenance indicated the wrath of his heart</p>

<p>On the 13th of August I gave my last farewel<br/>
to the Islands and started for my [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father-in-law's]] where<br/>
I arrived on the 20th.</p>

<p>The last day of summer I rode in company<br/>
with Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and sister [[Rhoda Farnham Carter Scammans|Rhoda F Scamman]] to the<br/>
beach on the sea shore. We spent an hour riding upon<br/>
this beautiful beach extending along the shore for about seven<br/>
miles in length and one hundred rods in wedth at low<br/>
water. It is composed of fine white sand, is almost a dead<br/>
level and very easy and pleasent to ride or walk upon.</p>

<p>The sun shone brilliantly upon the face of<br/>
nature the canvas of the gallant ships were filled with the<br/>
morning breeze as they sailed upon the great deep; wave<br/>
after wave reached the extent of their bounds upon the shore<br/>
and then rolled back to their source again. These together<br/>
with other varieties made the morning's excursion very pleasent.</p>

<p>After picking up a quantity of sea shells to carry<br/>
to the land of Zion for domestic uses and in memory of<br/>
the place we returned to Mr [[Luther Scammans|Scamman's]] and after visiting<br/>
others of the brethren we reached Father Carter's having been<br/>
during the day a distance of 20 miles.</p>",
42829.0,37,,"<p>I then went on to the top of the Kanyon through which runs Ash Creek. <br/>
[[Thomas Bullock|Thomas Bullock]] and [[Samuel F. Atwood|Samuel Atwood]] were with me. In about 2 hours <br/>
we rolled into the Kanyon <strike>about</strike> 1000 feet below about 50 tons of <br/>
rock. We rolled off one which would weigh about 5 tons. It fell <br/>
about 200 feet and struck a shaft of rock and took it with it and <br/>
falling into the Creek 800 feet below sent a sheet of water about fifty <br/>
feet into the air. We made a good deal of thunder for awhile <br/>
After wearying ourselves of this we returned to the fort</p>

<p>On our return we found the people assembled <br/>
in meeting. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] had spoken and also [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] <br/>
neither of which I heard. President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] was speaking when <br/>
I came in and [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] followed and the Spirit of God <br/>
was upon him and he prophesied many things</p>

<p>There was no report of any part of the meeting <br/>
only [[Thomas Dunlop Brown|T. D. Brown's]] minutes of President Young's speech which he <br/>
gave me and it is with our reports in the [[Historian|Historian's Office]]<br/>
Thomas Bullock and myself reported all the President's sermons <br/>
when we were present as we were appointed Historian and <br/>
clerk of the Camp.</p>

<p>Next day we rode back on the bench on our <br/>
return home 3 miles and the company stoped and President Young <br/>
located the new fort groun<strike>g</strike>d to be called [[Fort Harmony, Washington County, Utah Territory|Fort Harmony]] <br/>
Thomas Bullock took an account of it in his Journal. The <br/>
location was good and there was a great quantity of grass and <br/>
good soil. We rode to the Creek and nooned and thence <br/>
to [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Ced<strike>e</strike>ar City]]</p>

<p>About 20 miles south of the <strike>[[Virgin River, United States|Rio Virgin]]</strike> ^Fort Harmony^ <br/>
we descend rapidly a long distance into another climate on the <br/>
Rio Virgin. There was a kind of fruit there covering<br/>
thousands of acres which was very choice. Its flavor was <br/>
between a strawbury and cranbury. [[William Carter Staines|William C. Stains]]<br/>
had some of it growing in his garden</p>",
42829.0,78,,"<p>assembled in quarterly Conference at [[Farmington, Davis County, Utah Territory|Farmington]]. There were<br/>
present of the Twelve Apostles [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
and Wilford Woodruff; and of other missionaries [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo D Young]]<br/>
[[Gilbert Clements|Gilbert Clements]] [[Thomas Dunlop Brown|T. D. Brown]] and [[Richard Cook|Richard Cook]]</p>

<p>All the missionaries present had a cold<br/>
and a sore throat and they were all hoarse. It had come<br/>
on during the last 24 hours and it was a complaint that was<br/>
quite general among the people. Many hundreds men women<br/>
and children were at<strike>c</strike>tac<strike>t</strike>^k^ed in the same way. There was <br/>
no change in the weather nor anything on the outward appearance<br/>
of the elements to cause this general complaint</p>

<p>Elder Parley P. Pratt was quite unwell<br/>
He said he had not intended to preach this forenoon; but<br/>
he had to preach or go to bed. So he delivered a very <br/>
interesting discourse to the Conference for the space of<br/>
two hours and a half upon the birth life death and<br/>
resurrection of Jesus Christ. He took for his text<br/>
the ##Luke 2:10-11|10th and 11th verses of the II Chapter of St Luke##<br/>
""And the angel said unto them fear not for behold I<br/>
bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be<br/>
unto all people for unto you is born this day in the<br/>
city of David a Saviour which is Christ the Lord.""</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt in opening his discourse<br/>
gave some practical lessens upon the training of our children<br/>
in the history and knowledge of the Bible. He said<br/>
that one cause why he had taken that text was that a school<br/>
teacher in [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] had asked her whole school<br/>
where Jesus was born and not one of them could tell her. He<br/>
observed however that the children were small; but he urged<br/>
upon the Saints the importance of instructing even the smallest<br/>
children capable of understanding the history of the Prophets and <br/>
Apostles. He said by way of illustr[a]tion that every</p>",
42828.0,142,,"<p>September came and I soon began daily to make<br/>
preperations to leave the State of [[Maine|Main]] and our friends<br/>
and relatives in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] to lead a company of Saints<br/>
from the Islands of the sea to the land of Zion in<br/>
[[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]]. My [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child]] were to accompany me</p>

<p>It was the greatest trial Phebe ever had to<br/>
pass through, to take the parting hand of her parents<br/>
kindred and neighbours perhaps for the last time and<br/>
to go a journey of two thousand miles late in the fall<br/>
with our baby in the first stage of the [w]hooping cough<br/>
Add to this also that she was to leave a kind [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]]<br/>
house of plenty and go to a new country and settle<br/>
among strangers</p>

<p>These matters dwelt upon my wife's mind<br/>
and the persuasion of friends was also against her journey<br/>
under the trying circumstances. In fact it seemed at<br/>
times as though earth and hell were combined to crush<br/>
her troubled spirit and the sequel of our journey will<br/>
show that all this was like foreshadowings of that which<br/>
followed on our way</p>

<p>I cr<strike>y</strike>ied unto the Lord that she might<br/>
be supported under these and all other trials and I<br/>
soon found that the same Spirit which had<br/>
inspired her to embrace the fulness of the Gospel<br/>
and forsake her friends to go a journey of one thousand<br/>
miles to enjoy the society of the Saints—the spirit which<br/>
had also united her heart and hand to me and led<br/>
her to accompany me to the Islands of the sea was<br/>
with her still!</p>

<p>Yes Phebe possessed too much firmness and<br/>
faith and confidence in God to put her hand to<br/>
the plough and then look back or to wholy give<br/>
way to trials however great. Like [[Ruth (OT)|Ruth]] she was<br/>
determined to forsake kindred and country for my sake<br/>
and the cause in which we are engaged</p>

<p>As I beheld the spirit in her daily walk—<br/>
rooted in her heart and beaming in her countenance<br/>
my whole soul was bound to her in love stronger than<br/>
death such as we only feel in such circumstances.</p>",
42829.0,38,1854-05-26,"<p>A [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Ceder City]] Next day ^which^ was Sunday. [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] <br/>

[[Brigham Young|Young]] preached and I reported it</p>

<p>We left Parowan next day on our return to <br/>

West across the mountains and made a new road. After 20 <br/>
miles travel we nooned at the Fort at the foot of the mountain <br/>
The mountain was quite steep and ston<strike>e</strike>ny over which we had come <br/>
and we nooned in sight of [[Utah Lake, Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah Lake]]. In the afternoon <br/>
we drove to the bottom of the mountain beside the Utah Lake <br/>
on the West side and camped for the night. We had twenty five <br/>
men from [[Nephi, Juab County, Utah Territory|Nephi City]] with us to help us make a road.</p>

[[Hoytsville, Summit County, Utah Territory|Unionville]] where we made a short hault. Bishop [[Silas Richards|Richards]] had <br/>
prepared a good dinner for us but the company did not wish <br/>
to stop so near home: So President Young told them to eat <br/>
what they wanted and give the rest to the poor</p>

<p>We then rode on to Great Salt Lake <br/>
City having travelled in 26 days 594 miles being 287 to <br/>
[[Fort Harmony, Washington County, Utah Territory|Harmony]] and the same back</p>

[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] came. We none <br/>

that it should be baptized at that period of its life, because it had<br/>
been taught it by their parents and others. But, he said, was it not<br/>
for the name of Jesus Christ all our ordinances and administrations<br/>
would be of non effect and therefore our children should be thoroughly<br/>
taught concerning Jesus and his history.</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Gilbert Clements|Gilbert Clements]] preached<br/>
and in the evening [[Thomas Dunlop Brown|T. D Brown]].</p>

<p>On the Sunday [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] delivered an able<br/>
discourse upon the coming of Christ and read a revelation, from<br/>
the ##Doctrine and Covenants 49:22-23|Doctrine and Covenants##, given through [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Prophet to<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and others:</p>

<p>""Jesus Christ will not come in the form of<br/>
a woman, nor like a man walking upon the face of the earth<br/>
but look forth for the heavens to be shaken and the mountains<br/>
to be laid low &amp;c""</p>

<p>Orson Pratt after reading this revelation to<br/>
us then spoke of the work to be done previous to the coming<br/>
of Christ; also the first delivery of the Priesthood to Joseph Smith<br/>
by the Angel [[John the Baptist (NT)|John the Baptist]], the building up of the New<br/>
Jerusalem the Angels flying through the midst of the heavens<br/>
and the sounding of the trumpets as spoken of by [[John (NT)|John the<br/>
Revelator]] and the great day of the Lord's coming.</p>

<p>I have recorded a synopsis of this Discourse in my<br/>
Journal.</p>

<p>In the evening Elder Wilford Woodruff addressed<br/>
the congregation. Among other things he said:</p>

<p>""I am truly thankful that I have a mission<br/>
appointed me and in connection with Parley Pratt and Orson<br/>
Pratt two of the Twelve Apostles for it is the first time since<br/>
the organization of this Church and quorum that I have had<br/>
this privilege of being associated together with these two men</p>",
42828.0,143,,"<p>The devil had never tempted me to cease from doing<br/>
the will of God in not gathering to Zion or to cease travelling<br/>
and preaching the Gospel. I was therefore not inclined to stay<br/>
and enjoy the Society of my friends and kindred for in staying<br/>
I should have both ruined them and myself as touching the<br/>
Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Father]] and mother [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Carter]] and all my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife's]] brothers<br/>
and sisters had been uncommonly attentive and generous to<br/>
us during a year past but they could not see the propriety<br/>
of our gathering with the Saints. But we dared not let<br/>
this be an hinderance and I could only pray to God that<br/>
they might be brought to understanding and not lose their<br/>
reward for their great kindness to us.</p>

<p>I spent the 12th at Father Carter's packing<br/>
up the last remnants of our goods and on the next day<br/>
Phebe's father gave us one hundred dollars for which<br/>
sum we both signed a document to the effect that we<br/>
were satisfied and would hold no further claim to<br/>
any of his real estate or personal propety</p>

<p>About this time my mind was in suspence<br/>
because the camp of Saints did not arrive from the<br/>
Islands and I had not heard anything by letter from<br/>
them for some time past. The sickness of our [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|babe]] also<br/>
was an anxiety to us</p>

<p>On the 18 and 21st I received letters. In<br/>
the latter brother [[Nathaniel Thomas|Thomas]] informed me that the camp<br/>
would be ready to start in a few days. He wished me<br/>
to pray God to deliver them and enable them to go out<br/>
of Babylon. Truly it was a day of trial all round to<br/>
those who were seeking to go up unto Zion.</p>

<p>Several days afterwards I saw a report in<br/>
the Portland Transcript against the Mormons in [[Daviess County, Missouri|Davis<br/>
Co.]] Mo. which grew out of the fact that our brethren<br/>
claimed their privilege as American citizens and cast their<br/>
votes at an election. Numbers were rising up among the<br/>
Gentiles in the different counties to go over to Davis Co<br/>
and mob the Saints. All these reports had a tendency<br/>
to dampen the minds of those who were about to start<br/>
for the bosom of the Church. But none of these matters</p>",
42829.0,39,1854-06-14,"<p>The following day was Sunday and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Ezra Taft Benson|E. T. Benson]] <br/>
and myself preached to the people upon the subject of walling in their [[Fort Herriman, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]] <br/>
and schooling their children; and at the close of the meeting we returned to <br/>
[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]]</p>

<p>On the next day President [[Brigham Young|Young]] gave a party at the <br/>
[[Social Hall, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Social Hall]] to the company who went South with him and it continued <br/>
till midnight</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",06/14/1854
42829.0,39,,""">14th</time> we had a hard rain storm and a great deal <br/>
of heavy hail fell. One child was drowned and another nearly killed <br/>
A cloud broke and the water came down in torrents. It washed away <br/>
much of the city wall and much damage was done to houses and <br/>
gardens. On [[Little Cottonwood, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|little Cottonwood]] the hail cut everything down <br/>
Gardens corn and wheat were destroyed. It was also the same <br/>
at North Cottonwood. Nearly all the glass was broken out <br/>
of the windows</p>

<p>With Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and most of my family the <br/>
next day I drove my waggon to [[South Weber, Davis County, Utah Territory|South Weber Fort]] and we spent <br/>
the night at brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington's]] with whom I spent the following <br/>
day and preached to the people upon the subject of walling in <br/>
their city and educating their children; and to the sisters I spoke <br/>
about forming a female society to make clothing to clothe <br/>
the Indian woman and children</p>

<p>Returning to Great Salt Lake City next day <br/>
we nooned at brother [[Ezra Thompson Clark|Ezra Clark's]] and I saw his carriage (top <br/>
and sides) was cut to pieces with the hail. Hail there fell <br/>
as large as a small hen's egg. We rode through one hail <br/>
drift two feet deep washed by the water down the creek</p>

<p>On the Sunday [[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] and [[Orson Hyde|Orson <br/>

<p>In company with Parley and Orson Pratt on the<br/>

42829.0,80,,""">1st of November</time> I rode to [[South Weber, Davis County, Utah Territory|South Weber]] and we did not<br/>
arrive till a late hour. It was very dark. We got lost<br/>
in the bluffs and came very near running our carriage off a<br/>
steep bluff. I went to the fort got a pilot and lantern<br/>
and we arrived in safety. The people were assembled<br/>
for a meeting. I spoke to them for a short time and<br/>
spent the night with Orson Pratt at brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington's]].</p>

<p>Next day we rode to [[Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Ogden City]] and met<br/>
with the people in the capacity of a quarterly Conference.</p>

<p>We had a strong wind through the day<br/>
and night. It was the strongest gale we ever experienced<br/>
in these valleys. Much damage was done and many<br/>
adobie houses were blown down some unro<strike>f</strike>ofed fences laid<br/>
prosterate carriages and waggons mashed to pieces hay and <br/>
straw stacks blown over and many chimneys blown off</p>

<p>Next morning the people were gloomy in<br/>
consequence of the destruction by the wind which also continued<br/>
strong through that day and until the next which was Sunday</p>

<p>I reported all the discourses of the Elders<br/>
at the Ogden Conference. I left Parley Pratt preaching in<br/>
the afternoon of Sunday and rode to South Weber where I<br/>
preached in the evening to the people</p>

<p>In company with [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] [[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|Horace<br/>
Eldridge]] and [[Henry Harriman|Henry Herriman]] I rode to [[Tooele, Tooele County, Utah Territory|Tooele City]] to<br/>
hold conference. There were others of the missionaries<br/>
attening this Conference which continued several days</p>",

Conference in [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] according to the adjournment <br/>
at the General April Conference</p>

<p>The Conference opened at 10 o'clock and there were <br/>
present the Presidency the Twelve the various quorums of the Church and <br/>
a large congregation.</p>

<p>In the morning President [[Brigham Young|Young]] preached one of <br/>
the most interesting discourses and in the afternoon Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] <br/>
gave an interesting and very minute description of the martyrdom <br/>
of Joseph and Hyrum and all the circumstances leading to that <br/>
solemn event in our history.</p>

<p>Conference continued during the next day <br/>
and President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] delivered a long address.</p>

<p>A very important nomination was also made</p>",
42828.0,144,,"<p>moved me in my determination</p>

<p>The next day this article in the paper went<br/>
the rounds of the time among our friends and neighbours<br/>
They said it would not do for us to go ^and^ for that we should<br/>
be killed &amp;c if we did go</p>

<p>These fears formed no part of my trials<br/>
yet at no part of my time since I had joined the Church<br/>
was I subject to more care and suspence than now.<br/>
Yet I was never stronger in the faith.</p>

<p>But the case stood with me thus: The<br/>
Lord had commanded me to go to Zion spedily and while<br/>
I was setting myself about the undertaking the Devil and<br/>
his agents were using their combined extertions to hinder<br/>
me. I had been waiting for the Saints from the<br/>
Islands of the sea to accompany them until it was<br/>
very late in the season; the <strike>f</strike>Fall rains were upon us<br/>
and cold weather would soon set in and the minds of<br/>
the Saints around me were cast down and depressed<br/>
We had a dreary journey of two thousand miles before<br/>
us with no other prospect than to camp upon the cold<br/>
and damp ground. I had also a sick [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|infant]] of only<br/>
two months old to take with me and my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] whose<br/>
spirits at times felt severly the circumstances around us;<br/>
and when she suffered I suffered also. But thank God<br/>
she stood the trial like a brave woman</p>

<p>These were some of the things that made me<br/>
anxious at the time but I was determined to make the<br/>
journey before another Spring even if it was alone and on<br/>
foot and I had to b[u]y my bread by the way.</p>

<p>On the 28th I received a letter from brother<br/>
[[Nathaniel Thomas|Nathaniel Thomas]] in [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]] in which he said ""We are<br/>
almost ready, and shall start to-morrow morning."" This<br/>
cheered us.</p>

<p>Some days, however, passed before they arrived<br/>
and on the 3rd of October Elder [[James Townsend|Townsend]] started to look after<br/>
them and see why they did not get along.</p>

<p>On the next day at 2 p.m. our anxiety was<br/>
releived for the camp came in sight and I immediately<br/>
accompanied them to Sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss']] house where a busy scene ensued.</p>",

to [[Kennebunk, York County, Maine|Kenebunk]] and camped for the night by a saw mill and<br/>
as we were not fully organized there was some bustle amongst<br/>
us at first.</p>

tent to sleep upon the ground; but after we had become<br/>
reconciled to it there was an invitation given her to spend<br/>
the night at a house which was accepted.</p>

have published the marriage ceremony. It was sacred and one<br/>
of the last ceremonies attended to in the endowments and ought not to <br/>
have been given to the world</p>

<p>Brother Pratt said he thought it was no harm as <br/>
the plurality of wives and its doctrines were to be published to the world <br/>
and he should not have done it had he thought there had been the <br/>
least harm in it.</p>

<p>President Young said he was satisfied that brother <br/>
Pratt intended no wrong in it. He also said that the doctrine <br/>
taught in the Seer that God had arrived at that state where he could <br/>
not advance any farther in knowledge power and glory was a false <br/>
doctrine and that there never will be a time to all eternity when <br/>
all the Gods of eternity will cea<strike>c</strike>se to advance in power knowledge <br/>
experience and glory for if this was the case eternity would cease <br/>
to be and the glory of God would come to an end. Celestial beings <br/>
will continue to advance in knowledge and power worlds without end <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] would always be ahead of us. We should never catch up <br/>
with him in all eternity nor he with his leaders.</p>

<p>Brother Pratt also thought that [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] was <br/>
made out of the dust of the earth and he could not believe that Adam<br/>
was our God and the Father of Jesus Christ</p>

<p>President Young said that he was and that he</p>",
42828.0,146,,"<p>was to accompany us and [[Milton Holmes|he]] was appointed our Com</p>

<p>On the next day we continued our journey travelled<br/>
15 miles and camped in a beautiful medow</p>

<p>Fill up the interval from October 9 to Nov 2<br/>
with the journey and casualities of camp life including<br/>
a severe attack of something like the colera upon myself<br/>
and the sickness of several children [[Clara Newel Thomas|one]] of whom afterwards<br/>
died.</p>

<p>At this date our company began to seperate<br/>
Elder M. Holmes took steam boat at [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]] for [[Fairport, Monroe County, New York|Fairport]]<br/>
and after another day's travel brother [[Cyrus Starrett|Cyrus Sterrett]] and<br/>
his family and brother [[Daniel Whitley|W<strike>a</strike>hitley]] and family returned to the<br/>
city of Buffalo to spend the winter as the expence was<br/>
so great it was thought we could not all get to Zion. So<br/>
they stoped to labour and brother [[Nathaniel Thomas|Thomas]] let them have<br/>
a span of horses and a waggon to help them up in<br/>
the Spring.</p>

<p>Here it should be observed that in the very<br/>
starting of this company Nathaniel Thomas had cheerfully<br/>
steped forward to the assistance of the poor and invested<br/>
about 1000 dollars for waggons horses tents &amp;c to fit out<br/>
this company while others who possessed this world's goods<br/>
also, drew back and did not go with the poor lest they<br/>
should be under the necessity of assisting.</p>

<p>Journing onward to the 1<strike>4</strike>3th and we<br/>
were at [[Painesville, Geauga County, Ohio|Painsville]] where the Saints had been much persecuted<br/>
From this place the next day brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] walked<br/>
to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] to see brother Milton Holmes</p>

<p>We rested on the 15th on account of rain<br/>
but journeyed to [[Mantua, Portage County, Ohio|Mantanway]] on the following day and<br/>
spent the night at the Inn of [[Lewis Turner|Lewis Turner]]. Elders Holmes<br/>
and Townsend were with us again but Milton had made<br/>
up his mind not to go any further with us but to tarry<br/>
in Kirtland or in the regions around until the Spring</p>

<p>While at Kirtland brother Holmes had seen<br/>
several letters from [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] representing that there was<br/>
great trouble among the Saints caused by the inhabitants of<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] coming against them with armed force.</p>

<p>Next day, we left brother M. Holmes and</p>",
42829.0,83,1855-12-16,"<p>[[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Babbit]] followed and said he had as good a right to occupy<br/>
the Governor's seat as the Governor himself and made use of much<br/>
insulting language.</p>

<p>The Assembly then resolved that the freedom of the<br/>
house should be withheld from Secretary Almon W. Babbit. The<br/>
Secretary threatened to take all the money and return to [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]]<br/>
and pay no more expences of the Legislature. He was under<br/>
the influence of liquor</p>

<p>Babbit started for the city next morning. He<br/>
felt better however and did not take away the funds belonging to<br/>
the Legislature as he threate<strike>d</strike>ned. I sent letters by him to my<br/>
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]] and daughter [[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe]].</p>

<p><u>""Arise and shine O Zion for thy light is come<br/>
and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee</u>."" [##Isaiah 60:1##]</p>

<p>I have always felt since I have been<br/>
called to preach to speak of the practical things of every day<br/>
life instead of some great mysteries along way ahead in<br/>
eternity which the people do not know and never will as the<br/>
things taught do not exist.</p>

<p>I felt in the beginning of my ministry<br/>
that I had no right to preach unless I was filled with the<br/>
Spirit of revelation and prophecy as the ancients; and I<br/>
feel the same to-day</p>",

fruits of the earth begat children and they were earthly and had ^mortal^ bodies <br/>
and if we were faithful we should become Gods as he was. President <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] told brother [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] to lay a<strike>s</strike>side his philosophical reasoning and <br/>
get revelation from God to govern him and enlighten his mind more <br/>
and it would be a great blessing to him. He also told him to lay <br/>
aside his books and go into the Kanyons as some of the rest of us <br/>
and it would be better for him; and he said that Brother Pratt's <br/>
philosophy injured him in a measure.</p>

<p>The President made many more remarks worthy <br/>
of note. He said that we all should grow up in revelation so that <br/>
principle would govern every act of our lives. He had never found <br/>
any difficulty in leading the people since [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] death</p>

42828.0,147,,"<p>continued our journey without any particular incident for the interval<br/>
of three days at which date we were brought to another seperation</p>

<p>On the 20th we made arrangements to further devide<br/>
our little company, as brothers [[Nathaniel Thomas|Thomas]] and [[James Townsend|Townsend]] w[ere] inclined<br/>
to stop by the way and winter</p>

<p>Our company was truly getting very small there being now<br/>
only brothers [[Ephraim Luce|Luce]] [[Charles Brown|Brown]] and myself and our families to continue<br/>
our way together but we felt united in spirit and determined<br/>
to go onward</p>

<p>That night we had a comfortable room at a Inn 7 miles<br/>
from [[Wooster, Wayne County, Ohio|Worster]]. We were by ourselves for the night; and while sitting<br/>
by the fire side Sister [[Lydia Maria Macomber Luce Markham|Lydia Luce]] related a dream that she<br/>
had on the night before. It was as follows:</p>

<p>She saw a small sun in the South and while<br/>
looking at the strange phenomenon there appeared a ring of blood<br/>
in the West. There also appeared directly several other rings<br/>
of blood of a larger size all encircling each other, forming<br/>
a ring within a ring. Soon following this a ladder of fire was seen<br/>
blazing in the heavens and it fell to the earth and broke into<br/>
two peaces. One part of the ladder had an iron plate fastened<br/>
to the end of it with something also attached to it. She said<br/>
that in her dream I went and picked it up and read it<br/>
and it contained the XV. Chapter of [[Isaiah (OT)|Isaiah]]. By reading<br/>
this chapter it will be seen that this ^is^ very typical of what<br/>
has to befall this Gentile nation in particular and the world<br/>
in general in the last days.</p>

<p>As we travelled along we were continually hearing<br/>
of the Mormon war as it was called and the inhabitants of<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] were persecuting and puting the Saints to death because<br/>
of their religion</p>

<p>On the 23rd [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] was attacked with a severe<br/>
head ache which terminated in the brain fever. Still we<br/>
travelled on daily though my wife suffered much from the<br/>
journey.</p>

<p>The first day of winter was a pleasent one as<br/>
far as the season of the year was concerned; but O the winter<br/>
of sorrow was trying to seize upon my soul. Our company<br/>
was much afflicted.</p>

<p>It was December the first and as we journeyed</p>",
42829.0,84,,"<p>In order to be quallified to preach we should<br/>
be filled with revelation. [[Brigham Young|I]] do not consider that any man<br/>
is qualified to preach the Gospel and sayings of the Prophets<br/>
unless he is filled with the Spirit of the Prophets</p>

<p>We are commanded to arise and shine<br/>
but for us to sit down and say we believe in this work, we<br/>
believe that Joseph was a Prophet and still not carry<br/>
out the work which we are commanded to do; not to build<br/>
up and beautify Zion we shall find that we shall miss<br/>
our aim, we shall not enter into the celestial Kingdom<br/>
we shall not enter through through the gates</p>

<p>We must show to the Lord that<br/>
we are willing to fulfil what he requires of us and this<br/>
we shall not do unless we are willing to arise and<br/>
shine. But how are we to do it? We have<br/>
got to build up Zion, we have got to make Zion<br/>
the most holy and polished refined and beautiful<br/>
place upon the face of the whole earth</p>

<p>Some may expect to see Zion<br/>
in all that beauty majesty and glory which God has<br/>
spoken of; but the people do not understand the things<br/>
of God. I will prophesy that unless this people will<br/>
arise and build up Zion as God has commanded them<br/>
they will be removed out of their place and another people<br/>
will be raised up in their stead who will perform the work<br/>
and this I will say in the name of God. I also say in<br/>
the name of the Lord that the descendants of [[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]] who<br/>
are among the Gentiles are the first born and they are the<br/>
first ones to receive the fulness of the Gospel in this<br/>
Dispensation; they are the first to be gathered together<br/>
and this work was not to be given to any other. In<br/>
the beginning of the Kingdom of God this has been done</p>",

<p>My Mission to The Saints in the North</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",11/27/1854
42829.0,44,1854-12-01,""">27th of November</time> I started on a mission to the Saints <br/>
in the North of the [[Utah Territory|Territory]]</p>

<p>The first place I visited was [[Session|Session's Settlement]] <br/>
but I did not preach to the people for they were holding Court <br/>
in the School house to settle a difficulty with a <strike>g</strike>Gentile. Bishop <br/>
[[John Stoker|Stoker]] was the Bish<strike>i</strike>op of Sessions</p>

<p>Next day I was at [[Farmington, Davis County, Utah Territory|Farmington]] and held a <br/>
good meeting with the people. They were making many <br/>
improvements. They had a Court House built and many <br/>
good buildings going up. Bishop [[Gideon Brownell|Brownel]] presided over <br/>
Farmington.</p>

<p>On the following day I rode to Bishop [[William Kay|Kay's]]<br/>
[[Kay|settlement]] and found the people doing ^well^ and on the next I <br/>
visited [[South Weber, Davis County, Utah Territory|South Weber]] over which Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] was Bishop<br/>
This was the last day of November</p>

<p>I was at [[North Weber, Davis County, Utah Territory|North Weber]] <time datetime=""",12/01/1854
42829.0,44,,""">Dec. 1st</time> where <br/>
I preached to the people and and spent the night with Bishop <br/>
[[Abiah Wadsworth|Abiah Wadsworth]] who presided there</p>",
42828.0,148,,"<p>we passed brother [[Nathaniel Thomas|Thomas]] by the wayside mending his wagon<br/>
that had broken down. Brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] was quite sick.</p>

<p>I had not passed this afflicted company but a few<br/>
miles before I was called to stop my horses for the purpose to<br/>
all appearence to allow my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]—my companion to breathe her<br/>
last and resign her spirit into the hands of the God who<br/>
gave it. I stoped the wagon in the street where to<br/>
those around it seemed that her death couch stood But<br/>
while two of our sisters were standing by her side to<br/>
witness the scene of her last moments the Lord was very<br/>
merciful for notwithstanding that it seemed that breath<br/>
had left her body and her spirit departed she revived<br/>
again. I then drove the horses a few rods further and<br/>
put up at an Inn in [[Eaton, Preble County, Ohio|Eaton]].</p>

<p>Here I stayed the night taking care of Phebe<br/>
and the [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|babe]]. Earnestly did I pray the Lord to<br/>
spare the life of my wife.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday December 2<sup>nd</sup><br/>
It was absolutely necessary to discontinue our journey and<br/>
I concluded that for awhile we would tarry until Phebe had<br/>
recovered her health in some degree or departed this life</p>

<p>This settled and the next part was to<br/>
remove from the In for our circumstane would not permit<br/>
our remaining there. I therefore carried her into the wagon<br/>
and drove two miles to the house of Mr Mc. Kinzie<br/>
and put up not knowing how long we should have to<br/>
tarry for Phebe felt as though she only had a breath<br/>
of life remaining.</p>

<p>During the day brother Thomas and his<br/>
little afflicted company passed us again. The [[Clara Newel Thomas|child]]<br/>
whom I have already mentioned who died on the road<br/>
was a daughter of brother Thomas. Elder Townsend<br/>
who was travelling with him was now also sick.</p>

<p>After getting my wife and things into the<br/>
house and my horse put out I devoted myself to the taking<br/>
care of my wife.</p>

<p>In the evening she called me to her bedside<br/>
and said that she felt as though a few moments more<br/>
would end her existence in this life</p>",
42829.0,85,,"<p>The Ephraimites are before [[Brigham Young|me]] <strike>to</strike>here to day. Now if I<br/>
<strike>was</strike> ^were^ to ask you if you are willing to do as you are told you would say<br/>
""Yes."" But let me tell you there is not one of you who is<br/>
willing to do as you are told.</p>

<p>I have given the people counsel for years pass<br/>
how to build their forts walls cities houses and to begin to beautify<br/>
and adorn Zion; but have the people done as I have told them<br/>
in these things. You may say these are of minor consequences<br/>
but let me tell you that if you are not willing to do the small<br/>
things that are necessary on earth then you are not willing <br/>
to do as you are told in heaven and you will lose your<br/>
glory and exaltation</p>

<p>Now do you not remember that I told <br/>
you years ago to go to and build up a beautiful city in<br/>
this [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|place]] but there has been but little done towards it. We<br/>
have many who have been in the Church for quite a<br/>
number of years and yet we have not a builder or architect<br/>
who knows enough to build the meanest house not even<br/>
a kitchen in the New Jerusalem. Then how can<br/>
we build up the New Jerusalem? I have told the<br/>
people all the day long to be prepared to build up this<br/>
city; and I will say that if we could take all the knowledge<br/>
that exist among every nation upon the face of the whole<br/>
earth and boil it down into an essence and put it all into<br/>
one man he would not know enough to lay the first stone ^in the<br/>
wall^ around the New Jerusalem to say nothing about building<br/>
the city and Temple</p>

<p>We have got to improve continually and<br/>
build up good cities and adorn and beautify Zion and<br/>
let me tell you that if you do not come to that<br/>

riches or gold you are not worthy to do the work of</p>",

42829.0,45,1854-12-04,""">2nd</time> I was at [[Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Ogdan]]. This was the first time <br/>
I had ever visited the place. I found it a large settlement. I preached <br/>
to the people principally upon the tithing the Poor Fund the establishing <br/>
of schools and building their wall</p>

<p>On the Sunday I was at [[Bingham|Bingham's Fort]]. I preached <br/>
in the morning and dined with Bishop [[Erastus Bingham|Bingham]]. I found this to be <br/>
a flourishing place and well calculated for a city. The farming <br/>
land was good and abundant. The population at the time was <br/>
one hundred families. Much wheat was raised but I did not <br/>
learn the amount. The Bishop only had 30 bushels of tithing <br/>
wheat and 15 tons of hay: the remainder was in the hands of <br/>
the people. They had two schools ready to commence <br/>
their fort walls were 110 rods long ^and the fort 64 rods wide^. Three quarters of it was in <br/>
the process of erection. A part of ""Little Soldier's"" band of Indians <br/>
were distributed among the people to support and learn to work <br/>
They did not like it and seemed very mad and some were leaving <br/>
their wickeups and going to [[Weber River, Utah Territory|Weber river]]. Bingham fort is three <br/>
miles from Ogdon.</p>

<p>I left this fort and rode to [[Ogden Hole, Weber County, Utah Territory|Ogdon Hole]] and preached <br/>
in the eveing to a full house. [[Thomas Dunn|Thomas Dunn]] was Bishop <br/>
Ogdon Hole was one of the most flourishing settlements North <br/>
of [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]]. Their soil was very rich and the water <br/>
abundant. There were 47 families and a school of fifty <br/>
scholars. Their Fort was laid out 140 rods long and 74 wide to be <br/>
surrounded with a wall which was to be built of stone 4 feet <br/>
thick and ten feet high and laid in mortar. Much of the stone <br/>
was on the ground but not yet laid up. They had raised <br/>
there sixteen thousand bushels of wheat. The Bishop had in <br/>
hand six hundred bushels of tithing wheat and two tons of hay <br/>
They had also 13 head of tithing cattle. The wall of the <br/>
city was commenced</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",12/04/1854

42828.0,149,,"<p>[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|She]] manifested great confidence in the cause she had embraced<br/>
and also exhorted us to confidence in God and to keep his commandments.<br/>
To appearence she was dying but as on the day before she again revived<br/>
I prayed with her and laid hands upon her and commended unto<br/>
our Father in Heaven. She slept some during the night.</p>

<p>Two days after Phebe was still very feeble and low<br/>
and I returned to [[Eaton, Preble County, Ohio|Eaton]] to get some necessaries for her. I also felt the<br/>
power of the Destroyer resting upon in the forepart of the day</p>

<p>In the evening Phebe for the first time during<br/>
her sickness began to lay hold on faith for her recovery. Her<br/>
confidence grew strong and we laid hold on faith together; and<br/>
together we confessed our sins before the Lord and covenanted to<br/>
keep his commandments.</p>

<p>I had with me some oil that was consecrated<br/>
in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] for my anointing. I again consecrated it for<br/>
the healing of the sick and bowed myself before the Lord<br/>
and prayed with my companion and anointed and laid<br/>
hands upon her in the name of Jesus Christ. Thanks be<br/>
to God our prayer was answered and the fever left her</p>

<p>Two days more and the voice of the Lord<br/>
was to us to arise and continue our way to Zion and<br/>
through the mercy of God Phebe was enabled to rise and<br/>
walk a little. She had been confined at this place four<br/>
days where we were treated kindly.</p>

<p>Five days farther on our journey and<br/>
where we put up at night we suddenly heard the sad news<br/>
of the death of my brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel H. Woodruff]] who died at<br/>
[[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]] Indiania on the 18th of October 1838 at 3 o'clock<br/>
in the morning.</p>

<p>In the paper was published an account of<br/>
the Administrator's sale of the property of my brother. It was<br/>
sold on the 4th of December for about three thousand dollars<br/>
Mr [[Robert A. Smith|Robert A Smith]] was his administrator</p>

<p>There was also in the same paper an<br/>
account of the horrid butchery of 18 Latter-day Saints in [[Daviess County, Missouri|Davis<br/>
County]] Missouri by a wicked mob</p>

<p>The next day I rode to Terrehaute Indiania<br/>
through the delightful scenery of that country and drove to what<br/>
was As<strike>h</strike>ahel H. Woodruff's book store. Instead of finding him there</p>",
42829.0,86,,"<p>God; and if this people will not build up Zion they will be<br/>
removed out of their place</p>

<p>Every time we build a house or a city<br/>
we should better it. Everything around us should be<br/>
neat and clean.</p>

<p>Now look at this building for a school-house<br/>
The ground around this building should be prepared for <br/>
a play ground and should be kept neat and clean and<br/>
be prepared so as to make the children happy. Children<br/>
should be in a clean place. But how is it here. The<br/>
moment the children step out of door they see nothing<br/>
but filth all the day long. The minds of our children<br/>
while young are pure and they should not spend their time<br/>
in filthy places for it affects their minds and feelings<br/>
They should be in a clean place for they are visited<br/>
by the angels of God; but parents do not realize this although<br/>
it is true</p>

<p>You may say I do not have time to keep<br/>
my dwellings school-houses door yards &amp;c clean. No nor you <br/>
never will have till you die upon the same principle but you<br/>
should take time. Now it should not take a week till<br/>
[[Brigham Young|I]] would clean out my door yard; but the people in this [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|city]]<br/>
have not had time to clean out their door yards or to make<br/>
anything else that they ought to do</p>

<p>I will show you that I will set an<br/>
example for my children to follow</p>

<p>I will teach those things which we ought<br/>
to do to day. I have preached this doctrine from the<br/>
beginning. The first time I ever preached was to tell<br/>
the people their duties of to-day</p>

wide with a wall to be built around it, 70 rods of which was then 6 feet high <br/>
They had raised 12,000 bushels of wheat. They were very <br/>
deficient in Schools and had not but 3 months good schooling <br/>
for three years. The Bishop was very anxious to obtain <br/>
a good teacher</p>

<p>Next day I went to [[Box Elder County, Utah Territory|Box Elder]] and preached <br/>
in the evening at the School House. This place contained <br/>
60 families and brother [[William Black Davis|Davis]] was their Bishop. The <br/>
majority of the people were mostly Welsh and Danish <br/>
and mostly poor. There was but little wheat raised <br/>
by them this year. The Bishop had on hand 20 <br/>
tons of tithing hay and 15 bushels of wheat. They had <br/>
no school that Winter. Their fort wall was laid <br/>
out 200 rods long enclosing a fort 100 rods wide <br/>
The wall was to be built of stone 3 1/2 feet thick at the <br/>
bottom and 2 feet at the top and 8 feet high. It was <br/>

and [[Martin Ray|clerk]].</p>

<p>I had an interview with his clerk and made<br/>
enquiries concerning my brother's sickness and death but defered<br/>
attending to his business until the following day. It was<br/>
with difficulty that we could get entertainment in the [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|city]]<br/>
for the night but finally we obtained an empty house.</p>

<p>The next day December 13th I spent mostly<br/>
in enquiring into and attending to the affairs of my brother<br/>
Asahel. I learnt from Messrs Smith and Ray that he<br/>
died at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 18th of October and<br/>
that he was sick ten days and deprived of his reason<br/>
four days before his death. While in this state his<br/>
mind in its wanderings was principally upon his business<br/>
but he occasionally spoke of his friends. His disease was<br/>
the congestive fever on the brain.</p>

<p>They farther said that his mind for<br/>
several months previous to his death had seemed to them<br/>
occupied by some matters unknown to them. They was not<br/>
so well acquainted with the secret of this as I was for<br/>
I was corresponding with him and knew by his letters<br/>
that his mind was deeply interested upon the subject of the<br/>
Gospel and the Church of Latter-day Saints</p>

<p>Of his character they testified that he<br/>
was moral in his life temperate in his practises beloved<br/>
and honoured as a citizen and his loss deeply felt</p>

<p>Asahel was indeed a young man of very<br/>
excellent talents, firm and indipendent in mind and also<br/>
indipendent and liberal in his principals</p>

<p>I had not been privileged with an interview<br/>
with him for about seven years but we had corresponded<br/>
with each other by letter. He had a peculiar art in<br/>
letter-writing which gave much interest to all the productions<br/>
of his pen. Both of us had long anticipated much upon<br/>
our meeting but my hopes were thus suddenly blighted but<br/>
I said the will of the Lord be done: All is right!</p>

property was sold but his private letters journals manuscripts<br/>

is no California here; we have no gold. But it is not gold that is<br/>
going to build up Zion though we shall use a good deal of it, but<br/>
we have to do it with our hands.</p>

<p>You can make a beginning and do something<br/>
You can set an example. You can clean out your house and yard<br/>
and make that clean and you can stop the bed bugs from running<br/>
around you.</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] do not see the first fruit or shade tree in this<br/>
[[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|city]]. Come up to the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] and get some fruit-<br/>

<p>Now this is Zion and the light has come<br/>
and is shining upon you and you are called upon to build<br/>
up Zion. How? By going to California? No; for<br/>
there are millions of gold here and the Lord will send it into<br/>
sight when he thinks it is best for us to have it as he did in<br/>
California.</p>

<p>If you think it is not best to come here go<br/>
back to [[Missouri|Missouri]]. Old Father [[Martin Harris|Harris]] said that he would<br/>
stay at [[Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Kanesville]] so that when the Church got ready<br/>
to go back to [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] he would have but a short way<br/>
to go to what the people here would. Brother [[George Albert Smith|George A<br/>

nearest way there by way of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]] and <br/>
many will find that to be the case. The longest way<br/>
round will be the shortest way there</p>

<p>We have been called get speculators<br/>

miser and speculator in the world; for I am laying<br/>
plans to try to obtain everything there is on earth and<br/>
in heaven that is good. That is what I am after<br/>

what do you say to going out on to your lots to build your<br/>
houses and set out fruit trees? Your wall around this fort<br/>
is not much protection. You might as well stick up<br/>
a row of willows to scare and stop the Indians as anything<br/>
there is here.</p>

in this place. I want to join some 16 of the brethren<br/>

fired stones upon them in return. Some were wounded on <br/>

<p>Remarks by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]</p>

<p>President Kimball followed and said:</p>

<p>I felt quite well in the forenoon but<br/>
I do not feel well this afternoon</p>

<p>I know what President Young has said is true<br/>
We have come here and we have dedicated this people and this<br/>
place to God.</p>

<p>Now do the people realize why we are here. No<br/>
they do not. We are here for the benefit of all Israel. We<br/>
have not come here for a salary. We have come here to do<br/>
the will of God and I will say that the yoke is off from our<br/>
necks, and it never shall be put on again, not on the necks<br/>
of this people; for if we do not do as the Lord wants us to do<br/>
he will raise up a people who will do it. I tell you that<br/>
God will smite any people who undertake to stop this work<br/>
and I say that what President Young has said is true</p>

<p>You know that our children have to<br/>
learn the Alphabet first. So it is with this people. The<br/>
things which God teaches us are small and simple in<br/>
many respects but they are just as necessary for us to<br/>
learn and practise as it is for the child to learn his<br/>
letters in order to understand the arts and sciences for<br/>
we have to learn and practise small things before we can<br/>
obtain and carry out the greater things of God</p>

<p>Now we are required to begin to build<br/>
up and adorn Zion. We should set out fruit trees</p>",

the streets of the citizens which ended the fray</p>

<p>On this Christmas day also I met with the inhabitants of the <br/>
Fourtheenth Ward and delivered an Address to the people [[Isaac Morley|Isaac Morley]] <br/>
Bishop [[Abraham Lucas Hoagland|Hoagland]] and others addressed them as well and then they were <br/>

many peaches and apples and some thousand pounds of good<br/>
grapes as good as I ever tasted; and [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] is<br/>
as hard a place to live in as there is in these mountains<br/>
My wood for one fire cost me some 175 dollars</p>

<p>These Kanyons are full of good fruit which<br/>
you can get and set out. I have several kinds of good currents<br/>
which I got from the Ka<strike>y</strike>nyons which bear large and fine<br/>
fruit. These things all help to adorn the earth</p>

<p>Now go to and build up this place and<br/>
make a beautiful [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|city]]. You have a good place around<br/>
the [[Utah Territorial Statehouse, Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|State House]] for a city and gardens and orchards. The<br/>
soil is sandy and you have plenty of manure to make it rich</p>

<p>The people must learn and practise<br/>
cleanliness in this life. Some people think they can live all<br/>
their days in filth and dirt never even washing their bodies, then<br/>
die and go to heaven and be clean. But if you do not<br/>
learn and practise cleanliness in this life you will have to learn<br/>
and practise it in the next before you are received into the<br/>
society of those who are clean pure and holy.</p>

<p>You have got to be passive in<br/>
the hands of God. As the Prophet has said if we <br/>
are not passive in the hands of God as clay is in the hands<br/>
of the potter we shall have to be cut off from the whe<strike>a</strike>el and<br/>

""There are some things that grieve me. President Young was<br/>

be exalted to eternal riches in their fulness</p>

<p>There is no other way for men to get exaltation<br/>
but to follow their file leader. The Twelve have no right to<br/>
ask the Presidency why they do this or that or why they tell<br/>
the Twelve to do this or that. They only go and do as they<br/>
are told and the same principle should go through every quorum<br/>
in the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth and when this rule<br/>

<p>[[Brigham Young|He]] reproved the people for selling their land<br/>
warrents and said the wicked would put those very land<br/>
warrents upon our possessions and then there would be a fuss<br/>
with the Mormons and that was what the people of the world<br/>
wanted.</p>

accusation of it. It was first brought before the Probate<br/>
Court. Then Judge Drummond got out a writ of<br/>
Habeus Corpus given by Judge [[John F. Kinney|Kinney]]. The case of<br/>
the right of writ was tried before Judge Kenney the day<br/>
before, and Mr [[Aurelius Miner|Miner]] and Mr Ketting took a strong<br/>
stand against the Legislature and the laws of Utah. As<br/>
soon as the Court opened to day Judge Drummond<br/>
informed the Court that he wished to withdraw the whole<br/>
suit and Judge Kinney informed him that he would <br/>
have to be remanded back to the Probate Court. He said<br/>
he knew that but he wished to withdraw the suit without<br/>
mallace. It was withdrawn and the Court closed</p>

delivered one of his greatest Sermons. I was not at the<br/>

<p>Sermon<br/>
Delivered<br/>
By President Brigham Young<br/>
At [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|Filmore]]<br/>
Jan 13th 1856</p>

<p>By our acts we have said to the world we<br/>
are Christ's and we have exhibited it more than any others<br/>
of the Christian world. Every thread and tie that<br/>
binds man to man has been broken assunder, in consequence<br/>
of receiving the fulness of the Gospel of Christ. Men<br/>
have left their wives; wives their husbands; children their<br/>
parents and parents their children; brothers their sisters, and<br/>
sisters their brothers in order to be gathered with the Saints<br/>
of God that they might partake of salvation. <strike><span class=""unclear"">[illegible]</span></strike>^This people have<br/>
proven to the world by their acts that they have a knowledge of the way of life and salvation^</p>

<p>This people have proven to all men<br/>
that they can sacrifice every endearment in this life for</p>",
42829.0,153,1856-10-09,"<p>the [[Brigham Young|President's]] words they are a<strike>l</strike>sleep and ought to be dropped</p>

<p>[[Jedediah Morgan Grant|I]] think that Brother [[Joseph Young|Joseph]] ought to cut them off<br/>
and prune the trees around him.</p>

<p>How can the body be kept alive and healthy<br/>
when the head is asleep and dead? It has been with great<br/>
reluctance that I have voted for the Presidents of the Seventies<br/>
for a long time and I will say to those Seventies if your presidents<br/>
have gone to sleep dont you go to sleep but keep awake. If<br/>
your Presidency have committed adultery and done wrong<br/>
and committed great sins that will damn them dont you<br/>
do it but wake up</p>

<p>Is there any man ^who is^ in that council who has<br/>
been ordained a counsellor to Joseph Young? If so I do not<br/>
know it; but each man was ordained a President and is under<br/>
as much obligation as Joseph Young is to magnify his calling<br/>
and do his duty. But they never think of such a thing of<br/>
taking any burden upon their shoulders, but leave it all<br/>
for Joseph Young to do; and he has to drag them along</p>

<p>When I vote for [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] [[Zerah Pulsipher|Pulsipher]] [[Henry Harriman|Herriman]]<br/>
and [[Levi Ward Hancock|Levi Hancock]] I do it very reluctantly and I have done<br/>
so for years.</p>

<p>Now I want to have you to wake up and do<br/>
your duty.]-</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",10/09/1856
42829.0,153,,""">9th</time> Elder [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D. Richards]] and his<br/>
company called upon President Young to settle all their matters as<br/>
agents afar the Church abroad.</p>

<p>Some remarks were made last Sunday night<br/>
relative to the children of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]. President Young<br/>
said I have no <strike>rega</strike> fears with regard to the family of Joseph<br/>
God will take care of them and all will be right</p>

<p>We had just pas<strike>t</strike>sed through another General<br/>
Conference and such an one I never saw before. The Spirit</p>",
42829.0,97,,"<p>eternity life and salvation and we prove that we bear this principle<br/>
through every difficulty which we are called to pass through</p>

<p>It is our duty to make every sacrifice that is<br/>
required of us so that our Father in heaven, the holy angels and<br/>
all just men who sit enthroned in glory and power and dominion<br/>
may look upon us in the character; that is that they may see in their<br/>
kingdoms that we are willing to make every sacrifice (if [[Brigham Young|I]] may<br/>
call it a sacrifice) and not looking to man in order that we may<br/>
secure a seat with them in eternal light and glory. But<br/>
notwithstanding all the light and knowledge we have of life and<br/>
salvation do you not see how easy it is for us to turn away<br/>
to the right and to the left and say and do many things which<br/>
we afterwards regret and wish we had not done. Is it not <br/>
the <strike>s</strike>case with us all more or less? It is</p>

<p>I see a thousand weaknesses in myself that<br/>
I now regret and it is so with all those who have the light<br/>
of the Spirit of God. They can see their weaknesses and<br/>
regret them and they will try to overcome them. I cannot<br/>
only see these things in myself but I can see them in my brethren<br/>
for when I learn myself and Brigham I learn my brethren<br/>
By this rule I know all of you</p>

<p>We give way to temptation and angry<br/>
feelings against our brother and w<strike>h</strike>ant to be revenged on him<br/>
I ask is this a righteous feeling? No it is not and yet<br/>
we live day by day and week after week and year after<br/>
year in this way</p>

<p>The people will be guilty of a little lying<br/>
a little swearing a little deceiving and a little stealing. Do<br/>
you think you can be forgiven of all your sins and be forgiven<br/>
in a moment? No you cannot every Latter-day Saint<br/>
knows better. This would be sectarianism. The<br/>

right straight into [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham's]] bosom. But this is false doctrine<br/>
It is not true.</p>

<p>Some may say I cannot overcome my passions<br/>
when I am tempted and tried: I cannot help giving way to my<br/>
feelings; I must give vent to them and scold and sometimes<br/>
sware and I cannot help it. But [[Brigham Young|I]] can tell you, you can<br/>
help it. You have got to help it some time or other or you<br/>
cannot be saved. You have got to begin <strike>to learn</strike> to<br/>
learn to overcome. You should begin to improve day<br/>
by day; shun the errors as you see them and improve<br/>
upon them. Be a better man and woman to-morrow<br/>
than you are to day. Continue to improve. There<br/>
is not a man or woman here but what can do better than<br/>
they do.</p>

words. So I do use harsh words. I am death and<br/>

<p>As your leader I will say let us try to<br/>
improve our lives. Let us overcome every temper and<br/>
evil passion that arises within you. You can shut your<br/>
mouth and keep your tongue still and quiet; and the next<br/>
time you are tempted you can overcome it easier. Keep<br/>
silence and it will give you a great victory</p>

attempt to correct your children, conquer yourselves first.<br/>

do wrong knowingly for if we say or do things which are wrong we<br/>
are under obligation to confess our faults. It would be a hard<br/>
matter for [[Brigham Young|me]] to confess that I had done a wrong knowingly</p>

<p>You should be goverened by righteousness.<br/>
Let every Elder in Israel look upon his brethren and sisters like<br/>
little children. When a person does wrong in his foolish weakness<br/>
look upon it as such.</p>

<p>We see the children of men laboring hard to obtain<br/>
wealth. They labor night and day to obtain this object. But wealth<br/>
will not give you wisdom; but if you will shun evil and extend the<br/>
hand of charity to every living being and do good to all as far as<br/>
you have an opportunity. This will grow in you and you will<br/>
increase in wisdom and knowledge</p>

<p>We should live so as to enjoy the Spirit of<br/>
revelation that we may know the will of God concerning us in<br/>
all things. You should not live for yourselves alone for<br/>
if your affections are not placed on the Lord Jesus Christ and you<br/>
do not possess charity you will miss the gate and not enter into<br/>
the glory of God yourselves; for you will not receive the Spirit<br/>
of the Gospel.</p>

<p>You ^hearts^ should be empt<strike>y</strike>^ied^ of everything <strike>that</strike> ^but^ the<br/>

<p>The Gospel in the English Language the Most Effective</p>

<p>At the 14 Ward meeting Elder [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D. Richards]] testified that<br/>
he had found the people more ready to carry out the principles<br/>
of this Kingdom who had been taught it in the English language<br/>

I visited President Young. We found him feeble but<br/>
much recovered. The sickness had mostly left him as soon<br/>
as he had returned over the <strike>C</strike>Big Mountain towards the city<br/>
There had seemed something very mysterious about his sickness<br/>
He was taken very severely on the evening of the 14th with<br/>
pain in the kidneys and bowels and he nearly fainted away<br/>
Presidents Kimball and Grant administered unto him and prayed<br/>
for him and he began to recover. The Brethren felt that<br/>
the valley in which they were was ful^l^ of devils. They had<br/>
to go on to the mountain before they could get the spirit of<br/>
prayer. They felt that there was a legion of devils congregated<br/>
around them in the valley where the^y^ were and trying to destroy<br/>
them. They also felt that there was evil intended against<br/>
them on the road and that they should leave that valley and</p>",

<p>It is your duty to live your religion. No man can<br/>
magnify the Priesthood and his calling unless he lives his religion and unless<br/>
he is filled with the Spirit of revelation of the holy Ghost and of the<br/>
Holy Priesthood: then he can magnify his calling and do his duty<br/>
to his neighbor and all men; then there would be an end to<br/>
Bishop's trials and High Council trials</p>

<p>Parents are under the greatest obligations to<br/>
live their religion. So also are the young men and women<br/>
that when they get married their children may be begotten in holiness<br/>
born in holiness and brought forth into the world in righteousness<br/>
and then you cannot make anything but Saints of them</p>

<p>Begin your work right; carry it on<br/>
right; bring up your children right: then when they are<br/>
old they will not depart from it</p>

<p>This is the commandment which God<br/>
made with [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] that to his <u>seed there should be no<br/>
end</u> and this promise was made to him when he was childless<br/>
He received this covenant from the Lord and desired to see<br/>
it fulfilled upon the earth</p>

<p>Abraham was driven from his father's<br/>
house after he had received the Priesthood. ^The Lord bestowed his Priesthood upon him by a man whose name was [[Melchizedek (OT)|Melchesideck]]. When Abraham<br/>
received the Priesthood^ The people were<br/>
so wicked that no man would receive him; but the Lord<br/>
promised him a Seed through whom the Holy Priesthood should<br/>
be perpetuated forever and that to the increase of his seed<br/>
there should be no end. The Lord promised to Abraham<br/>
this great blessing. A man can have no greater blessing<br/>
than was promised to him; that he should have children<br/>
who should have the Priesthood. I would not ask for<br/>
any greater blessing than this for myself</p>

42829.0,159,1856-10-24,"<p>Literary and Musical Society. They came as a committee from<br/>
that society</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said, ""I do not like some things that<br/>
have been there. Most of the sisters and brethren have written<br/>
very good essays; but some have been vulgar. But I have no<br/>
objection to their being continued if they can be conducted in righteousness<br/>
I would like you to get a globe revolving there and give lectures<br/>
upon ge<strike>l</strike>ography history and science. They all belong to our religion<br/>
and there are but few who can retain in their memory the geography<br/>
of the world. So lectures would be interesting to many upon<br/>
this subject. I do not want to hear baldadash; but I want<br/>
to hear that which is right and tends to good</p>

<p>A man arrived from [[Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]] from whom we<br/>
learned that [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] was at [[Green River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Green River]] and that the last<br/>
company whom the Indians killed the same number as the soldiers<br/>
had killed of the Indians they in turn killed of the whites and<br/>
then they were satisfied and gave themselves up and they also surrendered<br/>
Mrs Margetts whom they had taken pris<strike>i</strike>oner.</p>

<p>Snow on the Big Mountain was eight inches<br/>

<p>Elder [[Dan Jones|Dan Jones]] arrived on the <time datetime=""",10/24/1856
42829.0,159,1856-10-26,""">24th</time> quite unwell and on <time datetime=""",10/26/1856
42829.0,159,,""">Sunday<br/>
the 26th</time> he was called up to speak but could only do so for a short<br/>
time. He looked nearly worn out</p>

<p>At the close of President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball's]] remarks which<br/>
followed he called upon all the horse teams in the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]] and [[Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|county]]<br/>
to go into the Mountains and pick up the companies who were<br/>
coming with hand-carts and bring them into the city. One hundred<br/>
and fifteen were raised in a few minutes and all were prepared to<br/>
start in the morning. They were to take grain to feed them<br/>
with. President Young was unwell and not at the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]].</p>

<p>At the prayer circle the subject came up concerning the<br/>
emigration starting so late that it had cost the [[Utah Territory|Territory]] more</p>",
42829.0,160,,"<p>than it would to have bought oxen and brought them through for we<br/>
have had to send some two hundred and fifty teams out to meet<br/>
the<strike>m</strike> emigration and to send some twenty tons of flour and many<br/>
thousands of dollars of shoes and clothing.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] asked why they were so late<br/>
Brother [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin Richards]] said that Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] wanted to control<br/>
the emigration and means and would not take hold and assist in<br/>
the work without</p>

<p>President Young said that Brother Taylor was a good<br/>
man in many respects but he was not fit to handle means any<br/>
more than a child. ""I am going to inform all the churches<br/>
people and agents next season who do not take my counsel<br/>
that they shall be suspended from the Church</p>

<p>Elder Taylor said that the Handcart companies<br/>
could not be forwarded short of £12 (pounds) which would <br/>
not do at all.</p>

<p>President Young observed to Franklin Richards<br/>
""You had your possitive instructions what to do but<br/>
John Taylor <strike>but</strike> stood in your way and you did not do<br/>
as you were told and the people were sent <strike>to^o^</strike> ^so^ late that it<br/>
cost us many thousand dollars to get them in. Now what<br/>
do you think of such things</p>

<p>Elder Franklin Richards said the only<br/>
excuse I have to offer is that [[Orson Spencer|Orson Spencer]] was dead<br/>
and John Taylor took charge of all things in the States and <br/>
informed me that he had instructions from President Young to<br/>
attend to it which it appears was not correct. Elder Taylor<br/>
wanted to handle the money himself which was wrong.</p>

<p>I met with President [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]] and all the<br/>
Missionaries at the house of Franklin D. Richards</p>

<p>President Grant said Elders Woodruff<br/>
and Franklin D Richards would preside over the missionaries</p>",
42829.0,161,,"<p>The following is a synopsis of the directions of President [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]]<br/>
to the Missionaries</p>

<p>""I want you to go through the [[Utah Territory|Territory]] and do what<br/>
God wants you to do. Go prepared for battle. When it is necessary<br/>
jerk men up by their <strike>mains</strike> ^names^. Wake up the Bishops and all presiding<br/>
officers and then the people.</p>

<p>""Now we want to know what all men are doing throughout<br/>
this Territory. The people are dirty: we want them to reform in this<br/>
thing. Many do not treat their children right but use them roughly<br/>
Now if a man has the Spirit of God he will use his children well and<br/>
treat them kindly. I can tell you that children are very sensative<br/>
and the treatment which they meet has a great effect upon them</p>

<p>We want to see to that the people are employed<br/>
The reason why we prosper in this [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]] more than in any other is that<br/>
we labour.</p>

<p>I went to [[Taylorsville, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|^Taylorsville^]] with [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] and the people<br/>
was so dead and bad that brother Joseph wanted to go home<br/>
and not stop. I told him I would not go until I converted<br/>
that people and I stayed until I ^had done it and they had^ got the Spirit of God. Then<br/>
I conqurerd the people. So at the city [[Bountiful, Davis County, Utah Territory|Bountiful]]. I preached<br/>
there until the Spirit stoped there for days but at first the<br/>
[[John Stoker|Bishop]] was asle<strike>a</strike>ep</p>

<p>When you go to a place treat the people right<br/>
Get the Spirit of God and then you will know what is going on<br/>
When you go to a place preach to the people. Dont get into<br/>
[[Noah (OT)|Noah's]] ark nor into the city of [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] but just tell that<br/>
people what you want them to do.</p>

<p>More was also said and then [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] spoke<br/>
^and^ [[Daniel Spencer|Daniel Spencer]] [[James Ferguson|James Ferguson]] [[Dan Jones|Dan Jones]] [[Edmund Ellsworth|Edmund Ellsworth]]<br/>

there had come an express from the First Handcart company and that<br/>
they brought bad news. They were caught in a snow storm and<br/>
dying very fast. The people became chilled. They would draw<br/>
all day and die at night and those who dug the graves for the brethren<br/>
would themselves die the same day.</p>

<p>This I learned from the messengers themselves<br/>
They said the night before they met the company there were<br/>
five deaths. There had been some 25 deaths twenty of whom<br/>
were men</p>

<p>They had not heard from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hand cart company<br/>
[[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] and [[Cyrus Hubbard Wheelock|Cyrus H. Wheelock]] went ahead with the<br/>
news that help was coming and [[George Davis Grant|George D. Grant]] followed with<br/>
ten of the best teams.</p>

<p>There had been about fifty five deaths in<br/>
the first company in consequence of cold. The captain of<br/>
the company had dealt out all the provisions to the people the<br/>
night before any help came and they did not know that<br/>
any help was coming. They dealt out 11 oz. to a man<br/>
9 to a woman and 6 to a child. There was but little snow<br/>
on the road till they got to the [[Rocky Ridge, Nebraska Territory|Rocky Ridge]]</p>

that weighed clear in every point. President Young taught<br/>
the people good doctrine and in a fatherly spirit.</p>

<p>The Presidency and Twelve and others met in council<br/>

remembered against them any more for ever either on earth or<br/>

<p>^On the <time datetime=""",11/11/1856

the teams had gone to the [[Sweetwater River, Nebraska Territory|Sweet Water]] and hearing nothing<br/>
from the companies they turned back. President Young<br/>
immediately took measures to raise an Express to go directly<br/>
and turn the teamsters back again to continue back until<br/>
they met the company and several horsemen were to go with <br/>
them</p>

<p>I heard early on the morning of the <time datetime=""",11/13/1856
42829.0,164,,""">13th</time> that an<br/>
Express had come in from the Handcart company and I went<br/>
to the President's and met with all the Presidency. The following<br/>
is a synopsis of what I learned</p>

<p>Brother [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph A. Young]] and [[George Davis Grant|George D. Grant]]<br/>
parted. They agreed that they should not go any farther<br/>
than the [[Devil|Devil's Gate]] until George came up. He did not<br/>
find the company so Joseph A. then went on to the [[Platte River, Nebraska Territory|Platte]]<br/>
and found them at the Upper <strike>c</strike>Crossing of the Platte. They <br/>
were in camp and had been nine days waiting for the<br/>
snow to go off. Soon brother George D. Grant<br/>
arrived and prepared the camp for moving. He asked</p>",
42829.0,165,,"<p>[[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph]] what would his [[Brigham Young|father]] do now if he was here^?^ Joseph A. Young said <br/>
""If my father was here he would take all the books and heavy materials and<br/>
cache them in order to save the lives of the people."" So they agreed to do<br/>
it; and they cached all their articles at [[Devil|Devils Gate]] and took up the<br/>
weak and the feeble and started towards home</p>

<p>They then sent an express back to have the teams<br/>
come on to them that was on the road. But brother [[John Van Cott|Vancott]] and<br/>
[[Claudius Victor Spencer|Claudius Spencer]] had got to the [[Sweetwater River, Nebraska Territory|Sweet Water]] and not hearing anything<br/>
from the Handcart companies they turned back with their teams<br/>
and nearly all the companies followed them. This news arrived<br/>
in the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]] several days since and an express was sent back to<br/>
turn them again to meet the handcart companies</p>

<p>All the companies out of the emigration were<br/>
together when the brethren found them. There were two ox<br/>
trains and the handcart train. Many of the old oxen had<br/>
died but the young oxen many of them were fat and fine</p>

<p>Brother [[Thomas Tennant|Tenant]] who had bought President<br/>
Young's place was dead. He died near [[Scotts Bluff, unorganized U.S. Territory|Scott's Bluffs]]. The<br/>
people were suffering with cold and hunger <strike>some</strike></p>

<p>[[David Patten Kimball|David Kimball]] and others went ahead<br/>
picked out camp grounds made up fires shovelled off the snow<br/>
and when the camp came up they would take the old men<br/>
women and children who could not walk and carry them to the<br/>
fires and help them get supper and then they would dance<br/>
around the fires and sing and shout to keep up the spirits of the<br/>
people; and while journing during the day they would wade over<br/>
all the streams and drag the handcarts over and carry all the<br/>
lame women men and children over</p>

<p>When [[William H. Kimball|William Kimball]] met with brother<br/>
Vancott he took one pair of his mules and put on to his own<br/>
waggon and told him to turn round with <strike>him</strike>the others and<br/>
follow him to the East until they met with the companies.</p>",
42829.0,166,1856-11-22,"<p>They had returned from the [[Sweetwater River, Nebraska Territory|Sweet Water]] as far as to [[Weber River, Utah Territory|Weber]] when<br/>
[[William H. Kimball|William Kimball]] turned them back again. <strike>Brothers</strike> ^Presidents^ [[Brigham Young|Young]] and<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] felt severe with Brother [[John Van Cott|Vancott]] and [[Claudius Victor Spencer|Claudius Spencer]] for<br/>
returning, and the President said that if they had the Spirit of God with<br/>
them they would not have done it.</p>

<p>Elder [[George Davis Grant|George D. Grant]] wrote a good letter to<br/>
President Young giving a description of the company and their situation<br/>
He <u>sa<strike>ys</strike>^id^</u> that not more than one third of the handcart company was<br/>
able to walk and many were barefoot and freezing their toes. When<br/>
the brethren found them they were all together and camped in about<br/>
a foot of snow where they had been nine days waiting for the<br/>
snow to go off and to recruit the cattle.</p>

<p>Among other things which came up at this time<br/>
was the subject of miracles. President Young said I have had<br/>
a $5 gold piece put into my pocket now two days in succession<br/>
I do not know from what source it came from. Brother Kimball<br/>
said it was an angel.</p>

<p>Brother [[Joseph Angell Young|Young]] then related a circumstance that<br/>
when he and brother Kimball was travelling East together they<br/>
had thirteen dollars and fifty cents only and they travelled until<br/>
they had paid $87 out of it and had sixpence left and they<br/>
received no addition from any known hand. Brother Kimball said<br/>
that an angel had put it into our trunk.</p>

hard all night to kill his body. The brethren laid hands<br/>
upon him many times and rebuked the powers of darkness<br/>

his head all through his <strike>s</strike>limbs and stomach and a rib at a<br/>

company. They were to camp that night ^at Killion's^ at the<br/>

<p>I called upon President [[Brigham Young|Young]] at his office. He had<br/>
been down to lay h<strike>ed</strike>ands upon President J. M. Grant who<br/>
lay very low. His lungs appeared to fill and he had<br/>
no power to raise anything from his lungs. It appeared<br/>
that he could not live but a short time unless there was<br/>
a change soon for the better. He said he felt as<br/>
though he wanted an apple some grapes or wine<br/>
or something upon his stomach. President Young<br/>
sent him down some and they roasted an apple an<br/>
he eat it about 12 o'clock and seemed to relish it well<br/>
He also drank some buttermilk which he relished<br/>
but it was a death appetite</p>

<p>The missionaries met at the [[Historian|Historian's office]]<br/>
and soon President Young came in and opened the meeting<br/>
with prayer. [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] made a short report<br/>
or address and was followed by Wilford Woodruff who<br/>
expressed his feelings in great plainness concerning the<br/>
people taking off from the President a part of the burden<br/>
which was resting upon him for he was wearing out<br/>
Then all the missionaries who were sent to the different<br/>
Wards were called upon to report. All made their<br/>
reports and spoke encourageingly of the reformation.<br/>
F. D. Richards and myself then started down to see</p>",
42829.0,169,1856-11-19,"<p>President [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]].</p>

<p>On our way down we met Dr [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Sprague]] who informed<br/>
me that President Jedediah Morgan Grant was dead. He died<br/>
December the 1st 1856 20 minutes past 10 oclock at night aged 40 years<br/>
9 months and 7 days.</p>

<p>Dr Sprague informed me that he had just breathed<br/>
his last. We immediately went into the house and found his<br/>
wives and children weeping bitterly. [[Jesse Carter Little|Jesse C. Little]] [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard W.<br/>
Hardy]] [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]] [[George Davis Grant|George Davisson Grant]] and Doctors Sprague<br/>
[[John Lewis Dunyon|Dunyon]] and [[Israel Ivins|Israel Ivins]] were standing around his body. As<br/>
I gazed upon his tabernacle of clay without his spirit I felt to<br/>
exclaim a mighty man in Zion is laid low—a valient man<br/>
in [[Israel|Israel]] has fallen and a great champion of the Kingdom of God<br/>
is taken from ^us^ <strike>our midst</strike>.</p>

<p>We felt his loss deeply. For two months it<br/>
seemed as though he had been hurried to close up his work. He<br/>
had been preaching for several months calling upon the people<br/>
to repent. His voice has been like the trumph of the<br/>
angel of God. He had been laboring night and day<br/>
until he was laid prostrate with sickness. He had shot<br/>
the arrows of the Almighty with great power among the people<br/>
He called at the [[Historian|Historians Office]] on the <time datetime=""",11/19/1856
42829.0,169,,""">19th of November</time> which<br/>
was the last day he was out. He was confined to his house<br/>
ten days before his death. He had a great vision while<br/>
he was sick which he told the brethren. He preached nearly<br/>
all the time and related all that he saw in the spirit world.</p>

<p>Soon after I entered the house on the night of his<br/>
death his wife [[Rosetta Robinson Grant|Rosetta]] was seized with great trembling and<br/>
nervous excitement and it seemed as though her frame would shake<br/>
to pieces. We laid hands upon her and rebuked the devil<br/>
which seemed to seize her tabernacle and she became<br/>
more calm. I assisted Dr Dunyon in laying out</p>",
42829.0,170,1856-12-03,"<p>the body of brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]]. I spent the night with his<br/>
remains</p>

<p>I left brother Grant's family a short time in<br/>
the morning called upon Capt. [[William Henry Hooper|Hooper]] found him quite sick and<br/>
administered to him. Then I went to my house got a piece of<br/>
fine linen and Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] accompanied me to brother Grant's. I<br/>
gave them the linen to make a garment and robes to lay out the<br/>
body in. I went to President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] to get [[Zina Diantha Huntington Jacobs Smith Young|Zina Young]]<br/>
to go down and help make the robes. President Young came<br/>
in and spoke of brother Grant's death. He said we had done<br/>
all we could to save his life but the powers the other side of the<br/>
veil were stronger than we were and he was wanted there</p>

<p>Sister Zina Young walked with me to<br/>
President Grant's and spent the day with the sisters in making <br/>

was sick throughout the day</p>

<p>Burial of President Jedediah Morgan Grant<br/>
<time datetime=""",12/03/1856
42829.0,170,,""">Dec. the 3rd 1856</time>.</p>

<p>I spent most of this day in writing the obituary of J. M. Grant</p>

<p>The doors of our deceased brother's house was<br/>
thrown open for the people to visit the corps and preparations<br/>
^were made^ for his funeral. Many thousands went through the house <br/>
to visit the body. At half past nine the military began<br/>
to form in open line from the residence to the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] and three<br/>
bands of music were in attendance. The Lieutenant General and<br/>
staff General Grant^'s <strike>and</strike> staff^ and all the lancers were in attendance and<br/>
a company of York masons formed in the procession. The<br/>
corps was removed to the Tabernacle and the place filled up and<br/>
many could not get in. But it took so long to get through<br/>
with the ceremonies of the morning that it was ten minutes</p>",
42829.0,171,1856-12-06,"<p>to 12 o'clock when President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] arose to speak. As it was<br/>
so late he did not speak but a short time and said he did not answer his<br/>
mind but his remarks were very interesting and instructive. At the<br/>
close of the meeting the procession was formed and the corps conveyed<br/>
to the grave followed by the largest procession ever formed on such<br/>
an occasion in the valley. At the grave President Young made<br/>
some remarks. He said</p>

<p>We have no cause to mourn for brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]]<br/>
and you have made a far greater display here than was necessary<br/>
far more so than brother Grant would have wished and far greater<br/>
display than I wish you to make over my body when I die</p>

<p>Brother Grant is well off and he has lived more<br/>
in advancement and far riper for eternity in 40 years than many<br/>
would in a hundred.</p>

<p>When I die I only want you to let my body rest<br/>
in the grave. I want to be buried decently but I do <br/>
not wish any great display at my funeral. Let your flags<br/>
lie still and all your military display. I hope the body<br/>
of brother Grant may lie here undisturbed till the resurrection<br/>
I see the warm feelings of the people for brother Grant. It is<br/>
cold let the people go home and let the bearers stay and<br/>
see the grave filled up properly</p>

<p>The procession then returned to the house of our<br/>
departed brother and during the evening I called upon brother<br/>
Grants family.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",12/06/1856
42829.0,171,,""">6th</time> I attended meeting of the Bishop<br/>
and council and Priesthood of the Fourteenth Ward at 2 o'clock.<br/>
[[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] was present. I sat and heard the report<br/>
of the brethren and when I was requested to speak by ^the^ [[Abraham Lucas Hoagland|Bishop]]<br/>
I arose and said that <strike>as</strike> the Bishop and missionaries had<br/>
appointed men as Teachers to the Gentile stores to preach<br/>
the Gospel to them but the Spirit said to me that it was not</p>",
42829.0,172,,"<p>wisdom to send men <strike>to</strike>as Teachers to the Gentile stores to preach<br/>
the Gospel to them. I considered they were wicked and<br/>
corrupt and it was like casting pearls before swine. When <br/>
I closed [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] backed me up and bore testimony<br/>
that what I said was true</p>

<p>Then the Bishop arose and opposed me<br/>
very strongly and said that he presided over the Fourteenth Ward<br/>
and he had sent the Teachers to preach to the Gentiles and he<br/>
wished them to go and do it.</p>

<p>I saw that the Devil had ensnared him.<br/>
When he sat down the Teacher arose and said What shall I<br/>
do. Brother Woodruff says do not go to the Gentiles and Bishop<br/>
[[Abraham Lucas Hoagland|Hogland]] says go. I arose and said obey your Bishop<br/>
for he says he will take the responsibility upon himself in<br/>
sending Teachers to the Gentile stores. Many of the<br/>
Priesthood were fired up upon the subject but the meeting<br/>
closed and we went home</p>

<p>Brother Richards and myself went up<br/>
to President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] and we related what had taken place with<br/>
ourselves and Bishop Hogland; and President Young was <br/>
astonished at the position which the Bishop had taken. He<br/>
said the Devil was leading him into difficulty and he could<br/>
not extricate himself without help. He immediately<br/>
sent for Bishop Hogland who came up and the subject was<br/>
talked over and President Young showed his error and<br/>
he saw and confessed it. President Young told him<br/>
that the Twelve held the keys of the Kingdom of God in all<br/>
the world where the Presidency are not and that no Bishop<br/>
presided over any one of the Twelve in any place. The<br/>
Bishop made his confession and went home.</p>

<p>I have related this as an example<br/>
of a principle that none might err and not as reflection</p>",
42829.0,173,1856-12-08,"<p>upon Bishop [[Abraham Lucas Hoagland|Hogland]] who was one of the best of men and the best of<br/>
Bishops</p>

<p>On the Sunday ^evening^ at the Fourt<strike>h</strike>eenth Ward I was requested to speak<br/>
I arose upon my feet though heavily oppressed in Spirit but the<br/>
Spirit of God came upon me and was like fire shut up in my bones<br/>
and I spake to the people about 3/4 of an hour and I scarcely knew<br/>
whether I was in the body or out of the body neither could I afterwards<br/>
remember much what I said and the house was as still as the house<br/>
of death.</p>

<p>On the evening of the following day I attended the meeting<br/>
of the missionaries and Bishops. Presidents [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
were present also Wilford Woodruff and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D. Richards]] of the<br/>
Twelve.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff arose and called the names of the Bishops<br/>
and missionaries most of whom answered to their names. F. D.<br/>
Richards then opened by prayer and singing and then Wilford Woodruff<br/>
arose and addressed the meeting. After his address President<br/>
Young sung, ""O happy souls who pray'' and then addressed the<br/>
meeting of which the following is</p>

<p>A Synopsis<br/>
Of the Remarks of President Young to the Missionaries<br/>
<time datetime=""",12/08/1856
42829.0,173,,""">Dec. the 8th 1856</time>.</p>

<p>Brother Woodruff has given us a good testimony—a living testimony<br/>
in the Spirit and power of the Holy Ghost. Now any of<br/>
the rest of you who have the Holy Ghost arise and speak to us<br/>
those things which will edify</p>

<p>-[ [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|B. L. Clapp]] and [[Edwin Dilworth Woolley|E. D. Wooley]] then spoke for a few<br/>
moments and then President Young continued]-</p>

<p>I don't expect to speak much to night. I have<br/>
learned to govern myself in talking as well as in other things.<br/>
It may be asked if this a new work. It is not a new work</p>",
42829.0,174,,"<p>but our reformation is the work we begun in when we embraced<br/>
the Gospel. [[Brigham Young|I]] have pointed out the errors of the people all the<br/>
time and shown the people their faults and told them what to do<br/>
But here is the difficulty: As soon as the Elders come home from<br/>
their missions in a few days they lay down their armour while they should<br/>
keep it on all the time and keep it bright but their minds are engrossed<br/>
with the things of the world and they lie down and go to sleep. Their <br/>
only ambition is to know how they can get this house built or to get<br/>
a farm horses cattle &amp;c. Their whole soul is in the work of the<br/>
world and not the building of the Kingdom of God. But any<br/>
man who gets property upon this principle it will corode him. He<br/>
has not wisdom to use it</p>

<p>I have to<strike>e</strike>ld the people a hundred times they<br/>
do not know how to get rich. The way for the people to get<br/>
rich is to do the will of God and they must be governed by the<br/>
revelations and Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Brother Woodruff has told us here to night<br/>
how it is. When I look upon the conduct of the people before<br/>
the reformation commenced as I was teaching them the way of<br/>
salvation daily and they would not give heed. It pained my <br/>
heart and I felt as if I should die; but when brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah M<br/>
Grant]] steped forward and took the burden off from me I was<br/>
relieved but <u>it has</u> <u>cost him</u> <u>his life</u>. Had he not have taken<br/>
that burden upon him he would have lived a few years longer in<br/>
our midst.</p>

<p>I have felt that unless the people would awake and live<br/>
their religion I must go down to the grave. But the burden of<br/>
this people was taken from me and it rested on him and it has<br/>
not yet returned to me although he is dead. Should it return<br/>
to me as it has been <u>I shall soon follow him to the grave</u> <u>for I<br/>
could not</u> <u>live long with that weight</u> <u>upon me</u></p>

<p>When you first received the Gospel was not</p>",
42829.0,175,,"<p>your hearts filled with love? <strike>a</strike>And did you not put on the Gospel armour and<br/>
would it not have continued with you <strike>all the time</strike> if you had lived your<br/>
religion all the time but you have had hard feelings in your hearts<br/>
<strike>and</strike> against your neighbor; but if the Spirit of God continued with<br/>
you it would <strike>have overcome; it would</strike> have overcome those evil feelings<br/>
And what if we were all to put our armour off and partake of the spirit of <br/>
anger and hatred? God would spew us out of his mouth and we should<br/>
go down to hell together and he would raise up another people to do his<br/>
will.</p>

<p>After all the stupor that has rested upon this people they have been<br/>
gaping for more revelation. [[Brigham Young|I]] do not mean one man but I mean<br/>
the whole people, while they have already a great deal more than they<br/>
are worthy of and if this people do not wake up and live their religion<br/>
the <u>Lord will take away the sources of revelation which they now<br/>
have from the people</u>. It is not a few men who have got to live<br/>
their religion but it is the whole community. If we as a people<br/>
will return unto the Lord I know he will receive us with open arms</p>

<p>I am glad that this Winter has commenced without<br/>
fidling and dancing. But would there be any harm in going<br/>
into the hall and having a dance if we felt right and kept the Spirit<br/>
of God with us? No there would not. But as soon as we<br/>
should opon this door how many would keep the amour on and<br/>
live their religion and keep the Spirit of God. Not many.<br/>
Some would but many would say come let us go and take a drink<br/>
and begin to get the liquor in them and they would say, ""Come<br/>
brother Brigham I am ready for anything; stand out of the way<br/>
here: Hurrah for hell; sware a little damn a little; steal a little<br/>
gamble a little and raise the devil</p>

<p>But we will stop fidling and dancing until<br/>
the brethren get power to overcome these things and keep them under<br/>
their feet. I do not intend to start dancing again until the<br/>
people will learn to do right and live their religion. I have to war</p>",
42829.0,176,,"<p>with the weaknesses of man. [[Brigham Young|I]] am encompassed with it. I know<br/>
what it is to fight it all the time. If you are going to continue a reformation<br/>
make up your minds to live your religion. If the people will do this<br/>
it will be as brother Woodruff says: the darkness will pass away and<br/>
I can live long among this people and so can brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and other<br/>
men. But if this people will go on lying stealing swearing and<br/>
whoring I dont want to live but I want to leave the people and go<br/>
to God and let the wicked go to hell. I hope that God will send<br/>
the wicked who will not repent <strike>so</strike> down to hell quickly to be burned<br/>
up so that they may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus</p>

<p>When I first came into this Church I was<br/>
an enthusiast ^and^ though^t^ I would never ^keep an account—never^ put pen to paper and never<br/>
say this or that is mine, but it is the Lords. We never can be of<br/>
one heart and ^one^ mind until we can say that all that we have is the<br/>
Lord's and that we are only his servants and stewards to control it<br/>
according to his will.</p>

<p>When the Lord gives me property he gives me wisdom<br/>
to use it. We have individual rights and shall have to all eternity<br/>
What are those rights. If I have any property horses cattle waggons<br/>
or anything else my neighbor has no right to steal it from me<br/>
and if the people have the Spirit of the Lord they will know that<br/>
it is not right to take anything which belongs to another without<br/>
liberty but let it remain where it is.</p>

<p>We are accountable for our time to the<br/>
Lord. Now if you have a months leasure time and you gamble<br/>
that away and do not bring to pass any good you may just as<br/>
well throw away $20, and you are accountable for this waste<br/>
of time</p>

<p>I am often astonished at the follies of this people. Many<br/>
women are asking their husbands for some new thing. They<br/>
want a dozen new dresses and many unnecessary things<br/>
But what does a person want of a dozen new dresses. If this</p>",
42829.0,177,,"<p>people would ask for those things which are necessary and do right you<br/>
would soon see the people get rich. But what are you doing? Are you <br/>
rich? No. The Lord can send the grasshopers crickets and locust<br/>
They are his armies and can eat us up and kill our cattle. He can<br/>
give us much or little as he pleases. If our eyes are single to the<br/>
glory of God and we do our duty the Lord could make us as rich as<br/>
^Ceasar^</p>

<p>What would you do with it? Agrandize yourselves?<br/>
No you should not; but send out millions of men to gather the poor<br/>
and send mules loaded with gold to buy the nations. But now we<br/>
are poor and can accomplish but little</p>

<p>Now I am here with brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]. If<br/>
you wish to <strike>answer</strike> ^ask^ any question we can answer right; but for me<br/>
to teach the Bishops their duty is folly for I have taught them over<br/>
and over for years. Now if I was going to a Ward meeting to preach<br/>
and the Bishop was to oppose me unless it was my duty to reprove<br/>
him I should sit and laugh at him but not contend with him<br/>
<strike>but</strike> When there is any difficulty between a missionary and a <br/>
Bishop or any two men they should not contend about it before<br/>
the people but talk it over among themselves and settle all differences<br/>
of opinion in the Spirit of God and not labour for the mastery</p>

<p>Remarks Of President Heber C Kimball.</p>

<p>Brother Kimball followed President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and said</p>

<p>""I am one with President Young and so was [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M.<br/>
Grant]]. He took hold of the work with all his might to wake<br/>
up the people and it killed him. If President Young was to ask<br/>
me to go forth in the same way I would do it but it would cut short<br/>
my life as it did his. I have never felt as though Jedediah was<br/>
dead. The savio<strike>r</strike>ur said those that abide in me will never die<br/>
His spirit is with us and he can do more for us now than he could<br/>
before. The Spirit of God is poured out upon some m<strike>a</strike>^e^n mightily</p>",
42829.0,178,,"<p>The reformation is doing good and the people are doing better<br/>
and those who get the spirit of God will stand and those who<br/>
do not will fall. The people are forsaking their sins</p>

<p>There are things in embr<strike>y</strike>io which will <br/>
try this people and those events will ripen as this people do<br/>
and all will have to get the spirit and revelation of heaven in<br/>
order to stand. And these things will be among all nations<br/>
and they will know it as well as [[Heber Chase Kimball|I]] know it</p>

<p>It will be a hard Winter. I want<br/>
you to wake up yourselves and then wake up your wives and<br/>
children and stop your lying and stealing and take the<br/>
burdens upon your backs which belong to you that the<br/>
Presidency and Twelve may only have to carry their own burdens</p>

<p>The time has come or is near at hand that<br/>
many who have trifled with the Priesthood and the things of God<br/>
will be destroyed and go to hell; and those who are not faithful<br/>
in magnifying the Priesthood it will be taken from them and<br/>
given to others and that quickly and I know it for angels<br/>
Prophets and holy men say it and it will be fulfilled</p>

<p>As to dancing I am tired of it. I never<br/>
want to see another man dance until he can do it by the<br/>
power of God. I felt that Spirit once and brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>
shouted Hosanna for we were both filled with the Spirit.<br/>
Neither do I want to see any more feasting at present. I dont<br/>
want to see any more jealous feelings. Some of our Bishops get<br/>
jealous of the servants of God. No man would be if he was<br/>
filled with the Holy Ghost</p>

<p>I would chastize a man if he stood in my<br/>
way when I know that I am a messenger sent of God. President<br/>
Young says that if the people do not do right he will not stay<br/>
long with them but shall go the other side of the veil. If he<br/>
goes I shall not stay long behind him because we will not have</p>",
42829.0,179,,"<p>one between us and if you dont do your duty we shall go soon. [[Heber Chase Kimball|I]] have<br/>
had many men try to stand between me and President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and when<br/>
I have been to see him many have snubed me; but I have seen<br/>
enough of this; and that man who will try to do it must look out<br/>
for God and his angels will smite him</p>

<p>I have no objection to men coming to President<br/>
Young to comfort him and do him good and when he gives them a wife<br/>
to give him $10 or $20 according as the man may value his wife<br/>
but men must not try to seperate us. If they do they will be cursed</p>

<p>I understand that brother Woodruff got a whipping<br/>
from one of them lately; but I tell you that although he is a small<br/>
man he is all gold and you will find it so in the end. You may<br/>
be thankful to ever get as good a place as he will get for he is<br/>
the pure gold and I wish you would get as good as he is.</p>

<p>The Bishops will not respect what the missionaries<br/>
say for they are jealous. But if you will get the Spirit of<br/>
God upon you there will be no jealous feelings in your heart. You<br/>
want the Spirit of God and the power of the Priesthood to rest upon<br/>
you as it did upon [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and does upon the Presidency and Twelve<br/>
Take that Priesthood upon you which belongs to you and magnify<br/>
it.</p>

<p>The missionaries <strike>went</strike> ^want^ to wake up. Then wake up the<br/>
Bishops and then wake up the people and all live your religion<br/>
and all will go well <strike>and</strike> if you will live ^up to^ your privileges<br/>
here and get the spirit of this reformation. It will reach all<br/>
over the earth and go to the ends of the earth and the wicked<br/>
will not have power over us; but this work will go from [[Zion|Zion]]<br/>
through all the world as the sap of a tree will go from the<br/>
trunk to the end of every limb and twig</p>

<p>I want to see the power of God among<br/>
the people that they may have faith to remove mountains if<br/>
necessary but the power of God will only increase as the Spirit of</p>",
42829.0,180,,"<p>God increases among the people that they may have faith to remove<br/>
mountains</p>

<p>If we do our duty the United States should be the aggressers<br/>
The Lord would say if they came against us ""Let my servant [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>
send 200 men and they would lick them up for God would assist<br/>
to fight our battles with the storm hail and snow and they would<br/>
be destroyed. [[Heber Chase Kimball|I]] know this would be done but we must get the faith<br/>
of the ancients.</p>

<p>As to brother Brigham I have to say that he is just as good<br/>
a man as ever was on earth.</p>

<p>Now wake up brethren and purify yourselves<br/>
before you try to purify others. Then go forth and lift up your voice<br/>
like a trumpet and call upon all men to repent and get full of the<br/>
Holy Ghost and there is not a man who will do it but what will be<br/>
filled with prophesyings as were the ancient Nephites and little boys<br/>
of four years old will prophesy</p>

<p>I do not wish to go to a feast or a dance until<br/>
the people reform. There is men enough here to bring forth this reformation<br/>
and men will not prosper until they do their duty to God and each<br/>
other. I have no desire to attend any recreation until this people<br/>
are filled with the Spirit and power of God and I do not think that<br/>
President Young has. If you will rise up and do your duty you<br/>
will be blessed and no man that rises up against us in this place<br/>
will prosper if we do our duty and we wash our feet against them<br/>
I believe in washing our feet against our enemies</p>

<p>The Spirit of God has been upon us for<br/>
more than a year and the people would play laugh and trifle about<br/>
it but if they had had the Spirit of God and had done their duty<br/>
they would have seen it. This has been my feelings all the time<br/>
I have felt that the people were trifling with the things of God</p>

<p>Brother [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah]] is fallen. A mighty<br/>
man is taken from us but his power is here. It still rests upon</p>",
42829.0,181,1856-12-10,"<p>brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] and myself and when we lay hands upon another man<br/>
the Spirit of God and of [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah]] will rest upon him in full force<br/>
that he may do the work, and fill his place as a councillor to the President<br/>
and I know it. May God bless you: Amen.</p>

<p>Others spoke and then Brigham Young said: The reason<br/>
why we take the Elders for missionaries who have just came in is that<br/>
we can set them to work while their armour is on for it has generally<br/>
been the case that soon after the Elders come in they throw down their<br/>
armour and some are so far left to themselves that they do not enjoy<br/>
the Spirit of God. In answer to the question of brother [[Levi Savage|Savage]] about<br/>
people restoring what they have stolen: In the first place I would<br/>
say I would not steal but where it cannot be restored I would say<br/>
put it into the P.[erpetual] E.[migration] Fund to gather the poor for I would not have anything<br/>
to do with it.</p>

<p>Others spoke and [[Hopkins Pender|Hopkins Pendo^r^]] [[John Markland Jones|John M Jones]] and [[Joshua Midgley|Joshua<br/>
Midgely]] were called to go out on mission and the Bishops with their council<br/>
the First Presidency of the Seventies the Presidents of the Elders Priests<br/>
Teachers and Deacons quorums were all requested to meet with the<br/>
missionaries in the same place on Monday evening each week.<br/>

on the night of <time datetime=""",11/25/1856

<p>Brother Heber C Kimball related the following:</p>

<p>""I dreamed that I was travelling with a companion<br/>
and we came to a powerful rapid stream of water like the [[Niagara River|Niagara <br/>
River]]. The waves were rolling very high and increasing in<br/>
size. The waters had been muddy but were getting clear<br/>
As we came to this powerful stream we did not know ^how^ we should<br/>
get over it. I turned my eyes a few moments from my companion<br/>
and when I looked back I saw him on the other side of the<br/>
river and climbing a steep hill. I did not know how he<br/>
got there. I wanted to cross so I called to him as loud<br/>
as I could. ^to stop and wait ^to^ for me but he paid no attention to me but went on as hard as he could.^ Then a person came to me and said you have<br/>
an iron rod in your hand, which I perceived I had several<br/>
feet long. The angel said to me you must use this rod<br/>
and feel your way over the river and I awoke. I considered<br/>
my dream and interpret it as follows:</p>

<p>My companion was [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] who has<br/>
suddenly died and left me and is the other side of the veil.<br/>
The waters mean the people <strike>in</strike> ^they are increasing in strength^ and growing better and<br/>
clearer. The iron rod is the word of God which I must<br/>
cling to till I get through death. I consider there are<br/>
great things awaiting this people.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",12/14/1856

emigration came in, about 30 teams with 200 souls all in good<br/>

they had to dig through. Next day the remainder of the<br/>

Wilford Woodruff said we have missionaries and Bishops from some<br/>
20 Wards and I would like to have a report from them all. I will give<br/>
each man some 3 minutes to speak in; then all can speak. They<br/>
all spoke. Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] and [[Jesse Carter Little|J. C. Little]] spoke first. Wilford Woodruff<br/>
gave some counsel.</p>

upon Brother [[Richard Ballantyne|Ballantine]] who had sent for me to administer to him<br/>
He was quite sick. We laid hands upon him and rebuked his<br/>
desease and he was better. He had dreamt that he was about to<br/>
die and saw his coffin and grave which was dug deep. Just before<br/>
he was to die he thought he was invited to a wedding but he was<br/>
too sick to go. And he dreamed that brother Woodruff with<br/>
some other one came to him and administered to him and he<br/>
was saved from death.</p>

<p>On <time datetime=""",12/21/1856
42829.0,183,,""">Sunday the 21st</time> after others had spoken<br/>
I arose and the power of God rested upon me and I called upon<br/>
Elder [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] to rise up in the power of God and lead out<br/>
as he was the President of the Twelve and awake up and get the<br/>
Holy Ghost and the Twelve will follow you in the field and<br/>
I called upon the people to awake and listen to the words of the <br/>
Presidency of the Church.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday Elder Hyde preached<br/>
upon the ^parable of the^ 10 Virgins; I followed him but was somewhat tied.<br/>
In the afternoon [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] spoke both<br/>
in the power of God. I followed and the Spirit of the Lord<br/>
rested upon me and I asked the people which they would do go</p>",
42829.0,184,1856-12-29,"<p>to and get the power of God and sustain the Melchezedic Priesthood with<br/>
the First Presidency and Twelve or would they reject it and have the<br/>
Presidency and Twelve and the Melchezedic Priesthood taken from<br/>
them and only the Aaronic Priesthood govern them and the law of<br/>
carnal commandments. The people must do one or the other</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",12/29/1856
42829.0,184,,""">29^<sup>th</sup>^</time> [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and myself went up<br/>
to President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] Office where we found him [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
and [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]. I Wilford Woodruff told President Brigham<br/>
Young that we had drawn up a few lines for the Presidents of the<br/>
Seventies to sign. I also said to him that I would not ask<br/>
my brethren to do what I was not willing to do myself and inasmuch<br/>
as I received my Apostleship from your<strike>s</strike>e hands I now surrender<br/>
it unto you and throw myself into your hands and if there is<br/>
any other man in Israel that you think will fill my place<br/>
better than I do I will freely take it and not complain about<br/>
it. Elder Lorenzo Snow said the same thing to President Young<br/>
So also did Orson Hyde.</p>

<p>President Young replied, ""As for you brother<br/>
Woodruff and brother Snow I have never known you when<br/>
you more felt the responsibility of your Apostleship or was as well<br/>
qualified to magnify your calling as at the present time; but as<br/>
for you brother Hyde I will say if you do not magnify your<br/>
calling better than you have done I shall object to your standing<br/>
where you do if nobody else does for you have not had the spirit<br/>
of your calling upon you. You have been trying to build<br/>
yourselve<strike>s</strike> up and not the Kingdom of God""</p>

<p>I remarked yes brother Hyde the quorum <br/>
of the Twelve feel this and have felt it for a good while. We want<br/>
you to take hold and lead as you are our President. We want a<br/>
leader and if you will magnify your calling we will be with you</p>

<p>President Young also ^made^ some remarks upon [[Orson Pratt|Orson <br/>
Pratt's]] course disaproaving of his philosophy and order of reasoning</p>",
42829.0,185,1856-12-30,"<p>I arose to go out and Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] said Brother<br/>
Woodruff are you going? Come dont be in a hurry. I shall be<br/>
jealous of you. Does not the Spirit of God dwell here? I want men<br/>
to stop here who has the Spirit of God. It rests me. I am crowded<br/>
all day with men and things which makes me weary.</p>

<p>I replied I did not intend to be in a hurry. I <br/>
had some appointments which I thought of attending ""but I enjoy myself<br/>
here and like to be here."" So I sat down with my brethren<br/>
till meeting time and then with [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]]<br/>
I went to the [[Seventies Hall, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Seventies Hall]] and found the Hall full and<br/>
[[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richard's]] there making 4 of the Twelve Present</p>

<p>We called upon the Presidents of the Seventies<br/>
to speak and all spoke and were followed by the Twelve who<br/>
had much of the Spirit and power of God and gave much good<br/>
instruction. We also spoke our feelings to the Presidents of<br/>
the Seventies concerning their surrendering their presidency to<br/>
the First Presidency of the Church.</p>

<p>Baptism of the Legislative Body.<br/>
<time datetime=""",12/30/1856
42829.0,185,,""">Dec. the 30th 1856</time>.</p>

<p>I met with the Legislative Council in the forenoon. President<br/>
Young was present and the Spirit of God was present. The ##John 15|XV<br/>
Chapter of St. John## was read and commented upon. It was<br/>
then moved that both Houses meet in joint session. We then<br/>
came together and speeches were made by Lorenzo Snow Wilford<br/>
Woodruff Brigham Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] and [[Hosea Stout|Hosea Stout]]</p>

<p>Among the remarks made by President Young<br/>
was that when the First Twelve were called he and brother Kimball<br/>
almost needed a stool in order to reach high enough to tie the shoes of<br/>
[[John Farnham Boynton|John Boyanton]] [[Lyman Eugene Johnson|Lyman Johnson]] and [[William Earl McLellin|W<u>m</u>. E. M<sup>c</sup>Lellin]] but now<br/>
they are gone and we remain. Brother Woodruff and Lorenzo<br/>
Snow say they never have felt the weight of their Apostleship and</p>",
42829.0,186,,"<p>responsibility as they do now. This I have known all the<br/>
time. If brother [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] feels the weight of his responsibility as an<br/>
Apostle to day I am glad of it for it is the first day of his life<br/>
that he ever did feel it.</p>

<p>Many other remarks were made and it was<br/>
finally moved that all the members of the Legislative body of the<br/>
[[Utah Territory|Territory of Utah]] repent of their sins and go to the Font at 6 o'clock<br/>
on the [[Salt Lake City Temple Block, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple Block]] and be baptized for the remission of their<br/>
sins which was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>The Legislature met at the Font as ordered<br/>
and they had to fill it with buckets from the [[City Creek, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Creek]]; and as the<br/>
Presidency and those of the Tw<strike>l</strike>elve at home had been baptized Elder<br/>
[[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin Richards]] went into the water and baptized Elder Orson<br/>
Hyde and some 17 others. Then [[James Willard Cummings|James Cummings]] went into the<br/>
font and baptized <strike>some 37</strike> the rest, also the missionaries 37 in<br/>
number.</p>

<p>We the Twelve then laid hands upon Elder Orson Hyde<br/>
and confirmed ^him^ <strike>Elder Orson Hyde</strike>, Wilford Woodruff was mouth<br/>
The Twelve also confirmed the whole company. I was mouth<br/>
in confirming 9 persons and I assisted in confirming 12<br/>
others</p>

<p>This was a new feature in Legislation. We believed<br/>
that if we could get the Spirit of God we could do business<br/>
faster and better than with the spirit of the devil or the<br/>
spirit of the world. There were 55 in all baptized.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year I met with<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and the Twelve and the missionaries at the<br/>
[[Historian|Historian's Office]] and we heard the report of all the missionaries<br/>
and a very interesting address from President Brigham Young<br/>
who spoke in the power of God upon our enemies and said<br/>
the Spirit of the Lord told him that inasmuch as he <br/>
had delivered us through all our troubles thus far while</p>",
42829.0,187,1856-12-22,"<p>in the land of our enemies that if we would trust still to <strike>h</strike>Him and ^do^ our<br/>
duty the Lord would bless us and still deliver us and that we need<br/>
not have any fears</p>

<p><u>Note</u>. The following to go into my Autobiography in the order of date.</p>

<p>On the evening of the <time datetime=""",12/22/1856
42829.0,187,,""">22nd</time> I attended the Seventies<br/>
meeting. There were present of the Twelve Elder [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] Wilford<br/>
Woodruff [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]]. The first business that<br/>
was attended to was the trial [[George Philander Stiles|G. P. Stiles]] for adultery. He emphatically<br/>
denied it though the testimony was strong against him. [[Albert Perry Rockwood|A P. Rockwood]]<br/>
was in the stand and he did not know what to do with him. I bore<br/>
it as long as I could and then I arose in the Stand and said:</p>

<p>""George P. Styles, I am going to ask you a<br/>
question and if you are <strike>i</strike>^in^nocent you shall proclaim your <strike>i</strike>^in^nocence<br/>
but if you are guilty dont you deny it before God the Holy Ghost<br/>
and these witnesses. If you do the judgements of God shall<br/>
follow your footsteps from this hour till you go to your grave<br/>
and from thence to hell.""</p>

<p>I put the question and he did not deny it nor<br/>
acknowledge it so he was cut off from the Church.</p>

<p>All the members of the Twelve present then spoke<br/>
and the power of God rested upon us like fire shut up in our<br/>
bones and many things were revealed to us. We advised the<br/>
Presidents of the Seventies to go forward and present their resignation<br/>
to President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and let men take their places who could<br/>
magnify the office</p>

<p>On the following day I met in the Legislative<br/>
Council. There was no spirit to transact business. Lorenzo<br/>
Snow moved that President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] should give us an address</p>

<p>President Kimball said, ""I do not feel much<br/>
like speaking to day. I feel feeble in body and want my liberty<br/>
to act as I am moved upon by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>But he began to talk and the power of God</p>",
42829.0,188,,"<p>came upon [[Heber Chase Kimball|him]] and he spoke for an hour. I followed him and the<br/>
room was filled as with consuming fire and all the members of the<br/>
house came in and they all spoke until sundown and the house<br/>
was filled with the Spirit of God almost to the consuming of our<br/>
flesh and many things were revealed which were marvellous</p>

<p>I attended the Bishops meeting in the evening<br/>
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] W. Woodruff [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] of the<br/>
Twelve were present and the fire of God was still with us. I <br/>
never spent such a day and night in Israel before.</p>

<p>Next day I reported to President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
what we had done in relation to the Presidents of the Seventies and<br/>
Judge [[George Philander Stiles|Stiles]] in cutting him off for adultery and President Young<br/>
approved of what we had done. He also told me to go<br/>
through the city and remove all the stumbling blocks I could and<br/>
where I found a Bishop or any other man who was in his way to <br/>
remove him and put a better man in his place.</p>

^Note^ President Kimball said he did not believe in the custom of <br/>
adoption that had been practised in this Church. No man<br/>
should give his birthright to another but should keep his<br/>
birthright in the linage of his fathers and <strike>not give it to <br/>
another</strike> go to and unite the link through the whole linage<br/>
of their fathers until they come up to a man in the linage who<br/>
held the Priesthood. The branch of a vine still abides<br/>
in the vine though it comes out of it. Unless <strike>this</strike>the vine is cut<br/>
off or the branch it will abide in it. A man should<br/>
keep his Priesthood and unite it with his fathers and not give</p>",
42829.0,191,1857-01-11,"<p>it to another and the Lord will save our fathers. Every man who gets<br/>
his patriarchal blessing and Priesthood becomes the Patriarch of his own<br/>
family and he should bless his own family.</p>

<p>I continued daily attending meetings and the Legislature<br/>
The following is</p>

<p>A Synopsis of President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] Remarks<br/>
In the 18 Ward <time datetime=""",01/11/1857
42829.0,191,,""">Jan. 11th 1857</time></p>

<p>It is right that we should meet together often to pray sing preach and<br/>
receive instruction in order to assist us to live our religion; but none<br/>
of these things or any of the ordinances of the Gospel which we administer<br/>
to the children of men or to each other benefit the Lord. Our worshiping<br/>
the Lord is no particular benefit to our Father in heaven; but it is all<br/>
entirely for our own benefit and in this light we should view it</p>

<p>There is a doctrine taught from the Stand and<br/>
frequently taught in public that we should follow Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] or<br/>
Brother Brigham or any man who leads and do as they say and obey<br/>
them and that is all that is required; but this is a false doctrine in one<br/>
sense. For I will say no man should trust to the testimony<br/>
of another but he should go to ^God^ and get the testimony for himself.<br/>
This every man and woman should do.</p>

<p>I might have heard Joseph Smith preach and<br/>
testify of the truth of the Book of Mormon and this work until he<br/>
had been as old as [[Methuselah (OT)|Methuselah]] and in the end I should have<br/>
snaped my fingers at him and said to him you are a foolish<br/>
old man and turned upon my heels and walked off if I had<br/>
not have had some other testimony besides his; but I went to the<br/>
Lord and the Lord revealed to me that it was true and that it was<br/>
his work and I received it upon that principle, I have<br/>
lived upon that principle from that day to this</p>

<p>It is the right privilege and duty of every man<br/>
and woman to get the revelation of Jesus Christ for themselves and</p>",
42829.0,192,,"<p>every person should get the Spirit of God and live by it and if all<br/>
would do this there would not be a man ^or woman^ unhappy in this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] and<br/>
the flood of complaint which now salute my ears of husbands and wives<br/>
complaining of each other would be done away</p>

<p>One man comes and says my family will not<br/>
be subject to me. Another woman says my husband abuses<br/>
me and I want a bill to get away from him and a thousand complaints<br/>
come pouring in upon me none of which I should hear if the people<br/>
lived by the Spirit of God. You should all obtain the Spirit <br/>
of God and overcome your passions.</p>

<p>When you get angry you should put a piece<br/>
of Indian rubber in your mouth and bite it until you could get <br/>
perfect control over your passions. Do not speak while you<br/>
are angry for you will say something that you will be sorry for<br/>
but if you will keep your thoughts to yourself when you are angry<br/>
They will not become the property of another.</p>

<p>Any person who is acquainted with me knows<br/>
that I have control over myself. I do not speak in anger to<br/>
my wives children or the people. I make all my passions be<br/>
in subjection to the priesthood and the Spirit of God</p>

<p>People cannot fulfil their calling and<br/>
do their duty unless they are filled with the Holy Ghost. I do<br/>
not know that there is a female in Israel worthy of the appellation<br/>
of a Mother in Israel. For any women to raise up children<br/>
unto the Lord as they should do <strike>they should do</strike> they should<br/>
be filled with the Holy Ghost when they conceive and continue filled<br/>
with the Holy Ghost until the child is born and weaned and then<br/>
the mother should have the Holy Ghost to teach the child until<br/>
he is grown up.</p>

<p>So the father should be filled with the Holy<br/>
Ghost when he begets a child and he also should be filled<br/>
with the Holy Ghost in order to train up that child right</p>",
42829.0,193,1857-02-01,"<p>that it will be holy unto the Lord and will have power with God. These<br/>
are true principles.</p>

<p>The Saints should bring all their passions in subjection<br/>
to the laws of God.</p>

<p>I am learning every day I live. I see some who<br/>
will bear testimony that they know that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] was a Prophet and the<br/>
Book of Mormon true and that this is the work of God; and yet<br/>
if anything is said which comes contrar<strike>r</strike>y to their selfish dispositions<br/>
they will manifest the most stuborn will and will not move one hair<br/>
from what their wicked dispositions dictate. I see it in families.<br/>
One will growl because one drops a mop at their door or does something<br/>
that does not please them. They have no disposition to do anything<br/>
only for their own gratification; but this is not right. You<br/>
should feel like this: What can I do to help you? I am not<br/>
above helping my neighbor. Do you want your shoes blacked?<br/>
I will black them. I am not too good to do it.</p>

<p>This is the way you should feel for the<br/>
Lord will reward you according to your work</p>

<p>There are many in this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] who are<br/>
miserable. Why? Because they have not the Spirit of God<br/>
They do wrong and get into the dark but no person should be<br/>
miserable who has received the Holy Ghost. They should<br/>
be happy all the time—day and night.</p>

<p>On <time datetime=""",02/01/1857
42829.0,193,,""">Sunday the 1st of Feb</time>. the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] was<br/>
filled to overflowing. While [[Alfred Cordon|A. Cordon]] was speaking [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C.<br/>
Kimball]] came in and soon after President [[Brigham Young|Young]] whose coming<br/>
created quite a sensation among the people for it was the first<br/>
time he had been seen in the Tabernacle since the day that<br/>
[[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] was buried. Brother Cordon soon stoped<br/>
and President Young arose and addressed the people for about<br/>
one hour and a half and he spoke in great plainness of the<br/>
things of the Kingdom of God.</p>",
42829.0,194,1857-02-08,"<p>On <time datetime=""",02/08/1857
42829.0,194,1857-02-09,""">Sunday the 8th</time> in the prayer circle President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] in speaking of a blank in the History said that it was during<br/>
that time in the fall and Winter of 1844 that [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] preached<br/>
his great sermon when he was going to take Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Victoria]] by the<br/>
nose. We did a good deal of work at the time on the<br/>
Temple and it was difficult to get bread for the hands to eat<br/>
I told the people or the committee who had charge of the Temple means<br/>
to deal out all the flour they had and God would give them more<br/>
and they did so. And it was but a short time before Brother<br/>
[[Joseph Toronto|Toronto]] came and brought me twenty five hundred dollars in <br/>
gold. The committee and the Bishop met and I met with<br/>
them and they said that the law was to lay the gold at the<br/>
Apostles' feet. Yes I said and I will lay it at the Bishop's<br/>
feet: so I opened the mouth of the bag and took hold of the bottom<br/>
end and gave it a jerk towards the Bishop and strewed the<br/>
gold across the room at his feet. I said now go and buy<br/>
flour for the workmen on that [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and dont distrust the<br/>
Lord any more for we will have what we need.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",02/09/1857
42829.0,194,1857-02-17,""">9th</time> my father [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]]<br/>
was taken sick with the Billious cholic and continued very<br/>
ill for some days and I thought he was ^striken with^ <strike>taken for</strike> death<br/>
but he recovered</p>

<p>On the following Sunday after a pleasing discourse<br/>
from [[George Sims|George Sims]] [[Chief Arrowpene|Aropene]] the Utah chief delivered a powerful<br/>
discourse and exhorted the Saints in the strongest manner to<br/>
follow their leaders and do right and not drink wiskey<br/>
or do wrong in anything.</p>

<p>I spoke after him and told the people<br/>
to lay that exhortation to heart as it was given by a Lamanite<br/>
chief.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",02/17/1857
42829.0,194,,""">17th</time> in company with [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] I called<br/>
upon President Young and asked him what I should do where</p>",
42829.0,195,,"<p>counsel was asked of me either by the Seventies or Bishops. [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph Young]]<br/>
said to the quorums of the Seventies that when they were called to be <br/>
Bishops or Councillors that they might still retain their place as Presidents<br/>
of the Seventies and not be ordained High Priests. Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]]<br/>
thinks they should be ordained Bishops and High Priests. What shall <br/>
I do about it?</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said that if they would go there and<br/>
hold their tongues about it they might stand as they are and act as<br/>
councillors to a Bishop; but if they will not, ordain them.</p>

<p>I said I thought men ought to walk in the channel<br/>
pointed out for them and not complain about it. President Young<br/>
said, ""Yes; let them do as they are told.""</p>

<p>I attended the Bishops' meeting in the evening<br/>
Bishop Hunter spoke and I followed him</p>

<p>I told the Bishops to impress upon the minds of the<br/>
people the necessity of living their religion after this date for if the<br/>
people again commit sin after being forgiven as they now were<br/>
they would not again be forgiven but the justice of the law<br/>
would be brought against them and they would have to pay the<br/>
penelty or be cut off from the Church</p>

<p>Again I told them they should not boast of their<br/>
authority and power or that a Seventy was greater than a High<br/>
Priest or a High Priest greater than a Seventy. No man should<br/>
boast of the power of the priesthood until he obtained some of that<br/>
power and it was manifested upon him and when that was <br/>
upon him he certainly would not boast of it, for the Holy<br/>
Spirit would teach him sense enough to know better.</p>

<p>It is very seldom that I have known the power<br/>
of the Priesthood made manifest upon the children of men in<br/>
our day to a very great degree; but in some instances it<br/>
was as in the case of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] at the time he<br/>
was full of the sick and dying at his door-yard and they</p>",
42829.0,196,,"<p>were strewed along the bank of the river for two miles and<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] rose up and shook himself like an old lion and commenced<br/>
at his tent door and healed all the people who were not dead,<br/>
on both sides of the river, by the power of God and his voice<br/>
was as the voice of God and the earth almost trembled under his<br/>
feet as he went along commanding the sick to ar<strike>r</strike>ise and be made<br/>
whole.</p>

<p>It was also manifest with Joseph while in prison and <br/>
in chains in [[Missouri|Missouri]] and his ungodly wicked persecutors<br/>
gathered around him and while he was fast in chains with<br/>
his brethren yet they goaded his feelings by boasting of how<br/>
many murders they had committed and rapes upon Mormon<br/>
wom<strike>a</strike>en and how they had cut the Mormons to pieces and<br/>
then they would blaspheme the name of God until his spirit<br/>
was reined up and he rose up in the power of God in the midst<br/>
of his chains and spoke as in a voice of thunder:</p>

<p>""Silence ye fiends of the pit! I will<br/>
not live another moment and hear such vile language from<br/>
mortals. Either you <strike>are</strike> ^or^ I shall die right here or else you<br/>
shall cease from boasting of such damnable deeds as you<br/>
are guilty of.</p>

<p>They quailed before <strike>him</strike> ^his words^ like leather wilting<br/>
in the flames and they bowed before him and made acknowledgments<br/>
to him. This was done by the power of God.</p>

<p>Again [[David Wyman Patten|David Patten]] was taken by an<br/>
armed mob under a United States warr<strike>e</strike>ant and when he<br/>
was surrounded by this armed mob of about 40 men under<br/>
the garb of law and who would not let him say a word in<br/>
his own defence he arose in the power of God and held them<br/>
fast to their seats until he had addressed them about half<br/>
an hour. He told them they were cowards rascals and<br/>
villains and he proved it to them and they had not power</p>",
42829.0,197,1857-02-21,"<p>to harm a hair of [[David Wyman Patten|his]] head and they let him and [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] go<br/>
away.</p>

<p>Again this power was manifested by President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] <br/>
on the Banks of the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] at [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] when the merchants<br/>
brought up goods to sell to the brethren who were going to the Mountains<br/>
Old Major Miller the Indian Agent was surrounded by officers and<br/>
Miller in order to show his great power told the merchants who owned<br/>
some Alkahol not to roll a barrel off from the boat or he would knock<br/>
the head in and spill it upon the ground.</p>

<p>President Young steped up and told the men<br/>
to roll it out and if Miller spilled it ""that moment I will spill his<br/>
clarrel.""</p>

<p>Miller and all the officers turned pale and the liquor was<br/>
rolled out and nobody hurt.</p>

<p>Other instances might be named when the power of the<br/>
Priesthood has been manifest but these men have never boasted<br/>
of it and never will.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",02/21/1857
42829.0,197,1857-02-23,""">21st</time> I carried to President Young's office a <br/>

[[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] and [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] and one to [[Phineas Howe Young|Phineas Young]]<br/>
requesting them all to forward us a brief history of their lives. I<br/>
found it a great difficulty to obtain information concerning Samuel<br/>

<p>My Fiftieth Year<br/>
<time datetime=""",03/01/1857
42829.0,197,,""">March the 1st 1857</time></p>

<p>I was fifty years old on this birthday. I had been preserved</p>",
42829.0,198,1857-03-08,"<p>unto this age through the mercy of my Heavenly Father. I had many<br/>
times during my life been snatched from the jaws of death by the power<br/>
of God and I had lived to see much of the power of God manifested<br/>
and much of his work displayed upon the earth. The last 23<br/>
years I had spent in his kingdom and travelled and preached the<br/>
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and built up churches to his name; and I<br/>
prayed that the rest of my life might be devoted to his service<br/>
and that I might do the will of God in all things</p>

<p>Important Items from<br/>
President [[Brigham Young|Youngs]] Discourse.</p>

<p>On <time datetime=""",03/08/1857
42829.0,198,,""">Sunday the 8th</time> of March President Young preached one<br/>
of the most comforting and interesting discourses ever delivered to the<br/>
people. He said if we pass our inspection before [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
we probably should [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] and Jesus. That we should be quite<br/>
safe. If all this people did not go to a celestial kingdom<br/>
it would be their own fault; but will all have the same exaltation<br/>
and glory in the celestial kingdom? By no means. There<br/>
will be but few who go there who will be crowned kings and<br/>
priests and Gods. There will be many millions in the<br/>
celestial kingdom who will not be exalted to those higher<br/>
blessings. This people are a good ^people^ and they are advancing<br/>
faster than any other <strike>people</strike> who ever lived. It would not<br/>
be 120 years instead of 365 before th<strike>is</strike>^ey^ <strike>people</strike> would with the<br/>
portion of earth they occupy be seperated from the whole of the wicked<br/>
The Lord will bless this people and if you will do as well as you<br/>
know how all will be well with you.</p>

<p>President Young made many glorious remarks.<br/>
At the Prayer Circle in the evening the President had [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt's]]<br/>
pamplet entitled the Holy Spirit read; and upon it President Young<br/>
said that Brother Pratt had got beyond the stars. He had<br/>
correlled them and got beyond them.</p>

<p>The President asked [[William Wines Phelps|Wm W. Phelps]] by what</p>",
42829.0,199,,"<p>authority he had proclaimed in public that he, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], was the man<br/>
that the Lord said he would raise up like unto [[Moses (OT)|Moses]].</p>

<p>[[William Wines Phelps|Phelps]] said ""[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] is gone and you are left to lead<br/>
the people.</p>

<p>Brigham Young: ""That is no argument at all. I might die and<br/>
and others be left. That does not prove that I or they would be the one<br/>
referred to. If I thought I was the man I would not tell of it. But I <br/>
think I am the great man that none of the Prophets ever thought of or<br/>
spoke of.</p>

<p>[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] said that a man in [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]] professed to<br/>
have a visit from a departed spirit. He comes to him dressed<br/>
in his temple robes and the man he comes to has not had his<br/>
endowments. I want to know what you think of it. I thought<br/>
the whole of it smelt strongly of brimstone</p>

<p>President Young answered, ""Now if the<br/>
people in Provo can be made to beleive that that is a true visit<br/>
about the third time he comes he will say that this Church is<br/>
not led by the man who ought to lead the Church. ^but the man who has this visit will tell you that he is to lead the Church^ Now I<br/>
will tell you how you may know it is a false. A spirit<br/>
will not come to a man in the flesh without he appears in his<br/>
glory and man cannot endure his glory; a resurrected body<br/>
may come and hide his glory; but that visitation is false.<br/>
It is not true""</p>

<p>On the following Sunday President Young<br/>
said to Elder Orson Hyde at the Prayer Circle, ""You have been<br/>
to both [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and [[Zion|Zion]] and seen both. I have not seen<br/>
either for I never have been in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]. Now it<br/>
is a plesant thing to think of to know where the o<strike>d</strike>ld Garden of <br/>
Eden is. Did you ever think of it or sense it. I do<br/>
not think many do. Now Jackson County is the Garden<br/>
of Eden. Joseph has declared this and I am as much bound<br/>
to believe it as much as I am to beleive that Joseph is a Prophet</p>",
42829.0,200,1857-03-17,"<p>of God. Many in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] have found out that<br/>
they cannot cultivate the [[Temple Lot, Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Temple Block]] and other places in that county<br/>
We must let the Lord take his own time to prepare the way for<br/>
our return to that County to build up that Temple</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] Charge to the Twelve</p>

<p>At a Bishop's meeting on the <time datetime=""",03/17/1857
42829.0,200,,""">17th</time> I made the following<br/>
remarks:</p>

<p>There is another subject which I wish to speak of. Brother<br/>
[[Edward Hunter|Hunter]] said that he wanted the clerk to keep a record of their<br/>
meetings as it would make a good history. This is a subject I<br/>
have always felt interested in and as there are many branches in<br/>
the Kingdom of God so there should be some person engaged in each<br/>
branch.</p>

<p>I have spoken upon the subject of Journal writing<br/>
and keeping a history of what transpires within us from day to day<br/>
I was deeply impressed with the importance of reading the history of the<br/>
organization of the quorum of the Twelve and the remarks of the Prophet<br/>
Joseph upon the subject: he said,</p>

<p>""I have for myself learned a fact by experience<br/>
which on reflection gives me much sorrow. It is a truth that if<br/>
I now had in my possession every decission which has been given<br/>
upon important items of doctrine and duties since the rise of this<br/>
Church they would be of incalculable worth to the Saints; but<br/>
we have neglected to keep a record of such things thinking perhaps<br/>
that they never would benefit us afterwards which had we now<br/>
would decide any point that might be agitated; and now we<br/>
cannot bear record unto the Church ^nor unto the world^ of the great and glorious manifestations<br/>
that have been made to us with that degree of power and authority<br/>
which we otherwise could if we had those decissions to publish<br/>
abroad.</p>",
42829.0,101,,"<p>through his posterity forever wherever the kingdom of God existed. Then<br/>
let every child for the future be begotten in holiness and remember<br/>
this one thing—live your religion</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] now want to speak of another thing. A small<br/>
portion of our time was spent in the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] where we <br/>
began to administer the ordinances according to the words of ##Malachi 4:5-6|[[Malachi (OT)|Malachi]]<br/>
in the 4 chapter 5th and 6th verses##—""Behold I will send you [[Elijah (OT)|Elijah]]<br/>
the Prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the <br/>
Lord; and he shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children<br/>
and the hearts of the children to the Fathers lest I come and smite<br/>
the earth with with a curse""</p>

<p>[[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] received a promise from the Lord<br/>
that his seed should be saved and all the seed of Abraham<br/>
among the Gentile nations or among the uncontaminated of <br/>
the house of Israel will be gathered. They have sinned<br/>
they have changed the ordinances and broken their covenants <br/>
or you would not see the children of these mountains in<br/>
the degredation in which we now find them</p>

<p>The Lamanites upon this continent are<br/>
Manassahites almost excluseively. There is but little of <br/>
the seed of [[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]] among them. They are accounted <br/>
as the<strike>e</strike> Seed of Abraham ^and they must be saved^ or they would not have become<br/>
so loathsome as they are. They are punished in the <br/>
flesh to make an atonement in the flesh for their sins<br/>
and transgressions and when they pass through the veil the <br/>
enemy will leave no power over them</p>

<p>In the day of the Lord Jesus Christ all<br/>
the particles of the blood of Abraham will be gathered together <br/>
The seed of Abraham has not been counted for many years<br/>
and never will be again. If an angel was to commence now to<br/>
number them all, <span class=""unclear"">[<strike>illegible</strike>]</span>when <span class=""unclear"">[<strike>illegible</strike>]</span>he had got the numbers together, before<br/>
they could be computed there would be a great number more</p>",
42829.0,102,,"<p>born during the time of their numeration so they could not be<br/>
numbered and this is the reason why his seed cannot be numbered</p>

<p>Brethren and Sisters you are of the<br/>
seed of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] and you should live your religion that you may<br/>
claim the promises of Abraham</p>

<p>This Priesthood will turn the hearts of<br/>
the children to the Ancient Fathers and the Fathers to the children<br/>
now, and those which are to come will be made perfect. This<br/>
chain must not be broken for mankind cannot be saved<br/>
any other way. The Priesthood must be linked together<br/>
so that all the children may be linked to Father [[Adam (OT)|Adam]]</p>

<p>It may be asked ""When will this<br/>
work be done? It will be done in temples in our day<br/>
and in the days of our children. We shall go into the<br/>
Temples and be pillars therein and go no more out; and we shall<br/>
plant trees and vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. [[Brigham Young|I]] wall call<br/>
it the Millennium. I carry it in my heart. I say it has<br/>
begun. Every Saint carries <strike>carries</strike> it with him</p>

<p>Then let us increase in every good thing<br/>
and we shall extend this influence from Zion until it roots<br/>
out every evil and brings all in subjection to the Kingdom<br/>
of our God.</p>

<p>We will administer in the [[Salt Lake City Temple, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]] which we<br/>
have now begun and that is one point gained and we will<br/>
seal man to man by the keys of the Holy Priesthood. This<br/>
is the highest ordinance. It is the last ordinance of the<br/>
Kingdom of God on the earth and above all the endowments that<br/>
can be given you. It is a final sealing—an eternal principle<br/>
and when once made cannot be broken by the Devil</p>

<p>When we return to Zion and build<br/>
the great Temple which [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] Saw, and the centre of<br/>
Zion is established the glory of God will rest upon it by</p>",
42829.0,201,,"<p>Since the Twelve are now chosen I wish to tell them a course<br/>
which they may pursue and be benefited hereafter in point of light of which <br/>
they perhaps are not aware</p>

<p>At all times when you assemble in the capacity of a Council <br/>
to transact buisness let the oldest of your number preside and let one or <br/>
more be appointed to keep a record of your proceedings and on the <br/>
decission of every important item let it be what it may let <strike>us</strike> ^such^ decission <br/>
be noted down and they will ever afterwards remain upon record as law<br/>
covenant and doc<strike>r</strike>trine. Questions thus decided might at the time <br/>
appear unimportant, but should they be recorded and one of you lay <br/>
hands upon them afterwards you might find them of infinite worth <br/>
not only to your brethren but a feast also to your own souls</p>

<p>Should you assemble from time to time and procede<br/>
to disclose important subjects or questions and pass descisions upon <br/>
them and omit to record such decisions by and by you will be <br/>
driven to straits from which you will not be able to estricate <br/>
yourselves not being in a <strike>position</strike> situation to bring your faith to <br/>
bear with sufficient perfection or power to obtain the desired <br/>
information.</p>

<p>Now in consequence <strike>to write</strike> of a neglect to write these<br/>
things when God revealed them not esteeming them of sufficient worth <br/>
the Spirit may withdraw and God may be angry. And here <br/>
is a fountain of intelligence or knowledge of infinite importance <br/>
which is lost. What was the cause of this? The answer is <br/>
slothfulness or neglect to appoint a man to occupy a few moments <br/>
in writing.</p>

<p>Here let me prophesy the time will come when if you<br/>
neglect to do this you will fall by the hands of unrighteous men. Were <br/>
you to be brought before the authorities and accused of any crime <br/>
or misdemienor and be as innocent as the angels of God unless <br/>
you can prove that you were somewhere else your enemies will<br/>
prevail against you; but if you can bring twelve men to testify</p>",
42829.0,103,,"<p>day and by night and those who are prepared will see the face of the Son<br/>
of Man and they will see [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] in the flesh in their<br/>
resurrected bodies. Then will the armies of Israel be terrible to all<br/>
nations; then will ^one^ chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight</p>

<p>Who will resurrect Joseph's body? It will<br/>
be [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] [[James (NT)|James]] [[John (NT)|John]] [[Moroni (BoM)|Moroni]] or some one who has or who will receive<br/>
the keys of the resurrection. It will probably be one of those<br/>
who holds the keys of this dispensation and has delivered them to<br/>
Joseph. And you will see Jesus and he will eat peaches and<br/>
apples with you but the world will not see it or know it for<br/>
wickedness will increase. Joseph and Jesus will be there. They<br/>
will walk and talk with them at times and no man mistrust who<br/>
they are.</p>

<p>Joseph will lead the armies of Israel whether he is<br/>
seen or not, whether visible or invisible as seemeth him good. Joseph <br/>
has got to receive the keys of the resurrection for you and I.<br/>
After he is resurrected he will go and resurrect brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>
Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] and brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Carlos]], and when that is done he will say<br/>
now go brother Brigham and resurrect your wives and children<br/>
and gather them together. While this is done the wicked will<br/>
know nothing of it though they will be in our midst and they<br/>
will be struck with fear. This is the way the resurrection<br/>
will be. All will not be raised at once; but it will<br/>
continue in this way until all the righteous are resurrected</p>

<p>After Joseph comes to us in his resurrected<br/>
body he will more fully instruct us concerning the baptism<br/>
for the dead and sealing ordinances. He will say be<br/>
baptized for this man and that man; and that man be sealed to that<br/>
man and such a man to such a man and connect the Priesthood<br/>
together.</p>

<p>I tell you there will not be much of this done<br/>
until Joseph comes. <u>He is our</u> <u>Spiritual</u> <u>Father</u>: our hearts</p>",
42829.0,104,,"<p>are already turned to him and his to us</p>

<p>This is the order of the Holy Priesthood<br/>
and we shall continue to administer in the ordinances of the<br/>
kingdom of God here on earth. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] will not officiate in<br/>
this low capacity any more: neither did Jesus, <strike>A</strike>^a^fter his<br/>
resurrection. If so he would have baptized [[Paul (NT)|Saul]]; but<br/>
he was exalted above the earth and he told Saul to go to<br/>
a certain man in a certain street and he would administer to<br/>
him the ordinances upon the earth</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] say to you dont hurry in the<br/>
ordinances. Dont do what you ought not. It is not<br/>
the time to hurry. We should not undertake to do now<br/>
what we ought to do fifty years hence. What have we<br/>
to do to day^?^ Purify your hearts that you may<br/>
receive the manifestation of the Spirit of God</p>

<p>When you sow your wheat you<br/>
prepare the ground and then sow your wheat and watch<br/>
it till the harvest. It is just so in the Priesthood<br/>
You will be just as busy as you can be to do the things<br/>
which are to be done to day</p>

<p>Now dont be in a hurry. I say<br/>
we are going to have time enough. I say I will be here<br/>
on earth to do all I can; and after I die and get my body<br/>
again (my resurrected body) I mean to come back to the earth<br/>
again and fight the devils and be here at the winding-up<br/>
scene. I want to see righteousness prevail and the<br/>
Saints have peace on the earth.</p>

<p>I wish now to speak upon another<br/>
subject. I am here as the Governor of this [[Utah Territory|Territory]]<br/>
and I wish to comm<strike>e</strike>^e^n<strike>d</strike>^ce^ my remarks upon this subject with <br/>
the [[Franklin Pierce|President]] of the United States. Is he the Master<br/>
of the United States? No he is not. He is selected</p>",
42829.0,202,,"<p>that you were in some other place at that time you will escape their hands <br/>
Now if you will be careful to keep minutes of these things as I have said it will <br/>
be one of the most important and interesting records ever seen. I have now <br/>
laid these ^things before your^ consideration and you are left to act according to your own <br/>
judgement."" (See Record of the Twelve and History of the Church Feb<br/>
1835; Historians Office)</p>

<p>I have thus refer<strike>ed</strike>red to some of the words of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
to the Twelve Apostles at their organization. This shows the feelings <br/>
of the Prophet Joseph upon the subject.</p>

<p>I have had this same subject upon my mind ever since<br/>
I have been a member of the Church. <strike>I have been inspired and moved<br/>
upon my mind ever since I have been in the Church.</strike> I have been <br/>
inspired and moved upon to keep a Journal and write the affairs of this <br/>
Church as far as I can. I did not understand why my feelings were <br/>
exercised so much in the early age of this Church; but I understand <br/>
it now.</p>

<p>I seldom ever heard Brother Joseph or the Twelve preach or teach <br/>
any principle but what I felt as uneasy as a fish out of water until I <br/>
had written it. Then I felt right. I could write a sermon <br/>
of Joseph's a week after it was delivered and almost word for word <br/>
and after it was written it was taken from me or from my mind <br/>
This was a gift from God unto me and I have kept a Journal of almost <br/>
every day of my life for the last 24 years. I could tell each <br/>
day what I had done what company I was in and what was transpiring <br/>
around me and any teachings or counsels from the Presidency of the <br/>
Church except where I knew the reporters had written their discourses <br/>
I have urged the same course upon the Twelve and all the quorums <br/>
of the Church to keep a record of their meetings and the dealings of God <br/>
with them and for all men who hear the Priesthood to keep a <br/>
record of their lives especially of all their official acts in the Church <br/>
and the Kingdom of God</p>

<p>You may say that this is a great deal of </p>",
42829.0,105,,"<p>to sit there as one of our servants to act for us and to do what we wish<br/>
to have done. So it is with the Congress and the Governors of the<br/>
several States and [[Brigham Young|I]] am here as one of them as the Servant of the<br/>
people</p>

<p>Congress has p^repared^ a Constitution for this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] which<br/>
they call the organic act and have granted certain rights to this people<br/>
as a community. They have said this Territory should be<br/>
organized thus and so with a Governor and Legislative Assembly<br/>
and the right is given to the people to elect twenty six Representatives<br/>
and thirteen councillors ann[u]ally. This body may enact laws<br/>
to control each of us and all the inhabitants of this Territory<br/>
including the Governor the Judges the Secretary the Supreme<br/>
Court the District Court and the Probate Court. They have said<br/>
they shall have all the power given to them by the Legislative<br/>
Assembly.</p>

<p>We have a Legi<strike>la</strike>slative Assembly and Majestrates<br/>
courts. Congress will send certain men to hold Supreme<br/>
Courts and send other men as officers to the Territory of Utah<br/>
to transact business for the Territory of Utah so as to make it as<br/>
easy as possible.</p>

<p>The United States Judges are not here as Kings<br/>
or Monarchs but as servants of the people and when you see a<br/>
Judge putting a city under ""martial law"" he manifests boyism<br/>
and you should pity him and give him a piece of cake</p>

<p>If a man wants to be what he is not it is<br/>
certain that he wants to get out of his sphere. When some<br/>
men know a hundred words they think they know all of Webster<br/>
Some will try to study a hundred sciences of the day and<br/>
then know no more than a child. When a man studies<br/>
Divinity five years he is only fit to be put down upon<br/>
the ground as a block to stand upon to get upon your<br/>
horses. </p>",
42829.0,106,,"<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] see some here who have come fifty or<br/>
one hundred miles at the squaling of a goose crow and dont you<br/>
know that if you want a court held there that the Judges should <br/>
go there and hold it? <strike>a</strike>And if a Judge dont know that it is because<br/>
he is very ignorant and he ought to learn his duty</p>

<p>I am perfectly astonished at these, my <br/>
brethren, to think that if a man takes a pumpkin and says<br/>
it is an apple you must acknowledge it is an apple and<br/>
swallow it as such or if they take a rotton potatoe and say it<br/>
is a peach and cram it down your throat as a peach. When<br/>
you see a rotton potatoe why dont you acknowledge it to be a<br/>
rotton potatoe</p>

<p>Now I say to you jurimen and witnesses<br/>

a Governor you ought to kick me out and all officers ought<br/>
to be served in the same way when they get out of their<br/>
place and act the fool or else let the people swallow the<br/>
rotton potatoe and call it a peach</p>

<p>I know the meaning the marrow<br/>
and the pith of the laws and the very principle upon which<br/>
they are built much better than the Judges do. I know<br/>
the meaning of them and the duty of all the officers in this<br/>

<p>They do not understand the law. When<br/>

nearly every leasure moment of my time for 14 years. But what of it? <br/>
I have never spent any of my time more profitably for the benefit of mankind <br/>
than in my Journal writing for a great portion of the Church History has <br/>
been compiled from my Journals and some of the most Glorious Gospel <br/>
sermons truths and revelations that were given from God <strike>through</strike> to this people <br/>
through the mouths of the Prophets [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] and the Twelve <br/>
could not be found upon the earth on record only in my Journals <br/>
and they are compilled in the Church History and transmitted to the <br/>
Saints of God in all future generations. Does not this pay one for <br/>
my trouble? It does.</p>

<p>In many instances in this Church men have been <br/>
appointed Clerks to write for the Church and they have kept the records <br/>
instead of delivering them to the President of the Church to whom they <br/>
belonged and soon they would apostatize and then they would insult <br/>
the Church by offering to sell them their own records at an enormous <br/>
price.</p>

<p>I have deposited my records and Journals in the [[Historian|Historians <br/>
Office]] where I hope they may do some good</p>

<p>We have had a very interesting time this Winter during <br/>
the Reformation among the Latter-day Saints. The spirit and <br/>
power of God have been poured out in a wonderful manner and <br/>
many glorious truths have been revealed through the Presidency <br/>
Twelves and others and in various quorums meetings. Now should <br/>
not there be a record kept of those things? In the commencement <br/>
of these meetings the clerks took quite full reports but thinking <br/>
it too much trouble they now t<strike>h</strike>ake them very short and we can <br/>
hardly get an outline of the real facts of our meetings and the <br/>
power of God and the dealings of God with us</p>

<p>According to the adjournment at [[Fillmore, Millard County, Utah Territory|Filmore]] a mass meeting<br/>

<p>The following is a sypnosis of a conversation of President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]]. He said:</p>

<p>""If any officers come to the army—the [[Alfred Cumming|Governor]] or Judges and<br/>
send word that they want to come in just inform them that they are as near<br/>
as they can come. Had they have come without a military array they<br/>
could have come and not have been molested but now they cannot come<br/>
We will not have any cursed scoundrel forced upon us to judge or rule<br/>
over us and they shall not come among us</p>

<p>If [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] comes with troops and intends to come<br/>
in I expect they will leave their baggage battary and a company to guard<br/>
it and come in on a forced march without it. Then we must not let<br/>
them sleep but use them ^up^ us as soon as we can. Work night and day<br/>
and not let them sleep.</p>

<p>Brother [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] thinks they are determined<br/>
to come in. I have sent word that if General [[William S. Harney|Harvey]] is on his<br/>
way to get into camp and kill him if possible and take the the animals<br/>
from Johnson if possible and take charge of the goods train. President<br/>
Young said I am glad of one thing; ie, this thing will be just as<br/>
the Lord wants it. If he wants them to come and get killed<br/>
it will be so. If he wants them to go North South or East he<br/>
will have it just as he wants and this I am thankful for and I feel<br/>
perfectly easy about it all.</p>

<p>You will find that when the Lord sees that we<br/>
are willing to fight and get just ready to shoot that he will fight our<br/>
battles. He said [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] may stop in the city this<br/>
time. Let Charles C Rich go. He is a good General and a wise<br/>
man in calculation. I reckon a good deal upon him in the<br/>
future.</p>

<p>On the next day the 29 General D. H. Wells with his<br/>
companions left the city to take command of the Expedition in<br/>
the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|mountains]] and the company of cavalry commanded by [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
Kimbal]]l also went out.</p>",
42829.0,204,,"<p>He should give a brief sketch of all his missions and of all his official <br/>
acts and the dealings of God with him. Then if he was to die and <br/>
the historians wished to publish his history they would have something <br/>
to go by.</p>

<p>Many think that this is a dry subject and unimportant <br/>
but it is not so to me. I am now trying to get up a history of <br/>
the Twelve Apostles as first organized. Half of them are now <br/>
out of the Church and scarcely any record left whereby I can get <br/>
a correct knowledge of their history in the ministry of this work <br/>
and some of those who remain and are laboring to build up the<br/>
Kingdom of God have not kept a record of their missions ministry <br/>
official acts and decissions upon important subjects and the gifts <br/>
graces and dealings of God with them sufficient to give a true and <br/>
correct history of their lives</p>

<p>There are but a few aside form the Presidency <br/>
of the Church who feel the importance of this subject sufficient to <br/>
put it into practice. The majority think the matter not <br/>
important; but I believe it is otherwise.</p>

<p>The Prophets would not have been moved <br/>
upon to exhort us to faithfulness upon this subject had it not been <br/>
important. The Lord has told us that what we seal on earth <br/>
shall be sealed in heaven and what we record on earth shall be <br/>
recorded in heaven and what is not sealed or recorded on earth <br/>
is not sealed or recorded in heaven. Therefore it appears to be <br/>
very important that we do keep a true and faithful record in all <br/>
things.</p>

<p>While walking in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in <br/>
the same water neither can we spend twice the same time. When <br/>
we pass out of that door the work of this meeting will be closed <br/>
to us forever. We shall never ^again^ spend the time of this evening <br/>
Then should we not keep a record of our work teachings and <br/>
counsels which we give in this meeting? We should.</p>",

<p>In a prayer circle on <time datetime=""",02/17/1856
42829.0,110,,""">Sunday the 17th</time> President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] asked [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] what he thought of his preaching that<br/>
intelligent beings would continue to learn to all eternity.</p>

<p>Orson Pratt replied that he believed the Gods had<br/>
a knowledge at the present time of everything that did or will exist to<br/>
the endless ages of all eternity. He believed it as much as any truth<br/>
he had ever learned in or out of the Church</p>

<p>President Young remarked that he had never learned<br/>
that principle in the Church; for it was not true: it was false<br/>
doctrine; for the Gods and all intelligent beings would never cease<br/>
to learn except it were the Sons of Perdition: they would continue<br/>
to decrease until they became dissolved back into their native<br/>
element and lose their identity</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P.<br/>
Pratt]] preached a good discourse in the 14th Ward. He told the<br/>
[[Abraham Lucas Hoagland|Bishop]] to cut off all the liars thieves adulterers and profane swearers<br/>
from the Church for they would rot the body if they continued<br/>
on it. He said many wicked men would stick by the<br/>
Church but they would never repent of their sins. There was<br/>
a time when man could repent but when that time was past<br/>
men might pray till their knees where [were] callaced and they could<br/>
not get the Spirit of God. How long did the people who<br/>
were destroyed in the flood have to wait before they could<br/>
have the offer of the S<strike>r</strike>pirit of God or the Gospel? They<br/>
had to wait more than two thousand years, till after Christ<br/>
came and was crucified. He then went and preached to the<br/>
""Spirits in Prison."" The Gospel was then offered unto them.<br/>
And how has it been with the Jews. They once saw the<br/>
day when the Gospel was offered unto them but when<br/>
they put to death their King and Saviour the Gospel</p>",
42829.0,205,,"<p>Again Elders go forth upon missions to the nations of the earth <br/>
They have to enter into a regular warefare. The Lord pours out his Holy Spirit <br/>
upon them and they war with the world the flesh and the devil, with <br/>
kings princes lords presidents and rulers. They are cast into prison <br/>
and the Lord delivers them. The devil enters into some of their <br/>
converts and the lay hands upon them and cast them out. The <br/>
Saints are sick and they heal them. They prophesy in the name <br/>
of the Lord and their words come to pass. Rulers declair that <br/>
they shall not preach to the people on pain of death. They preach<br/>
the word of God and many believe obey and rejoice in the Lord <br/>
and they are protected by the power of God. They go<strike>es</strike> upon <br/>
the sea and the storms rage and they calm<strike>s</strike> the<strike>m</strike> water and <br/>
wind in the name of the Lord. They are shielded and <br/>
goverened by the angels of God all the day long and they know <br/>
the power of God is with them revealing unto them the evils<br/>
that lie in their path.</p>

<p>And yet the Elders do not view these great and <br/>
important things of value enough to make a record of them to <br/>
spend a short time in writing them; and the circumstance<br/>
and history of these blessings unto them are lost both to the present <br/>
and the future generations. Are these things right? I do <br/>
not believe they are. I do not believe men are justified in <br/>
neglecting to record these things</p>

<p>Now as an example: Should the ten lost <br/>
tribes of Israel suddenly come pouring down upon us in the land <br/>
of Zion led by the Holy Prophets of God what would be one of <br/>
the first enquiries we should make of them? It would be where <br/>
are your records and History and the revelations and dealings <br/>
of God with you since you were led away under [[Shalmaneser (OT)|Shalmaezer]] <br/>
king of [[Assyria|Asyria]]? O do let me see and read them and do <br/>
let me have the journal of your travels from the North country <br/>
to our land of Zion </p>",
42829.0,252,,"<p>On the 3rd of Nov. an express arrived and brought<br/>
a letter from Col. [[Edmund Brooke Alexander|Alexander]] thanking Governor [[Brigham Young|Young]]  for sending him<br/>
his prisoners and saying that he should send back those he held only<br/>
he had a civil process against them. Probably his intention was to<br/>
hang them for treason.</p>

<p>Vision Of Angels In the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple of Kirtland]]<br/>
Related by President Young<br/>
Nov 8th</p>

<p>In our prayer circle on this Sunday President Young related the<br/>
circumstance of the brethren seeing a circle of about 40 persons dressed<br/>
in white robes and caps in the upper room of the Temple Kirtland<br/>
during the Spring 1835 after the endowments. There was<br/>
no person in the room at the time who was mortal yet the room<br/>
was filled with light and many personages appeared clothed in white<br/>
and frequently went to the windows and looked out so that the brethren<br/>
in the streets could see them plainly. Brother Young and [[Truman Osborn Angell|Truman<br/>
O Angel]] stood together in the street and looked at them. [[William Wines Phelps|W. W.<br/>
Phelps]] says he saw them for 3 hours. They were visible by all<br/>
the brethren present. Brother Angel said they must have stood<br/>
some two feet from the floor as they were only the size of common<br/>
men. They could not have been seen from the place where<br/>
they stood except it had been the head and those personages<br/>
appeared nearly down to the waist as they looked out of window<br/>
with a front view.</p>

<p>Col. [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson's]] Arrival in Camp</p>

<p>Col Albert S. Johnson commander ^had^ arrived in the Camp of<br/>
the main army and on the night of the 8th an express arrived<br/>
in the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|City]] with the news and the fact that the Calvary was advancing<br/>
upon [[Fort Bridger, Green River County, Utah Territory|Bridger]] under a gallop and our picket guard had to run</p>",
42829.0,111,1856-02-24,"<p>was taken from them and given to the Gentiles. It was also given <br/>
to the Lamanites and the Ten Tribes of Israel. The first were<br/>
to be last and the last first. It will now come to the Gentiles<br/>
first then to the ten tribes of Israel and the Lamanites before it<br/>
will go to the Jews: they will be the last to receive it. Who has<br/>
ever heard of the Jews having the Spirit of God or the Gospel or Kingdom<br/>
of God offered to the Jews since they put to death Jesus Chirist and<br/>
the Kingdom went to the Gentiles? No one for it has never been<br/>
done. They will go home in unbelief and wickedness and<br/>
rebuild [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] in that state and they will be so far from the<br/>
Gospel that when the Gentiles come against them to battle rifle<br/>
their houses ravish their women and carry half of their city into<br/>
captivity and Jesus Christ comes and delivers them in the midst<br/>
of this hour of peril and trouble they will not know him nor<br/>
even imagine who he is till they ask him about his wounds<br/>
and he tells them. Then the Gospel has to be preached to<br/>
them and they will repent be baptized and receive the first<br/>
principles of the Gospel</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley]] also said there was a promise<br/>
that the Three Nephites and angels should visit the Lamanites<br/>
but they could not be sent to them <strike>to receive</strike> with messages to<br/>
receive and obey the Mormons until all the Mormon Missionaries<br/>
were righteous men and would not steal lie sware or commit<br/>
adultary for if the angels were to tell them to obey the<br/>
Mormons and <strike>and</strike> they found the Mormons to do wickedly<br/>
they would lose confidence in both the angels and the<br/>
Mormons</p>

42829.0,206,,"<p>And what would be our disapointment should their Prophets and Elders <br/>
say, O we have not got any history of the dealings of God with us nor <br/>
any journal of our travels. We used to hear our fathers say that <br/>
there had been greta and mighty things done in the land where we <br/>
lived. The Saviour came and taught great and marvellous things<br/>
and we had a glorious time in coming here. We smote the rocks and <br/>
the mighty mountains of ice fell down with a great noise and great <br/>
miracles were wrought but our fathers had so much to do and we have <br/>
had so much to do that we never had any time to write anything <br/>
about it and we did not think that any body would have any interest in <br/>
it but ourselves, and so we did not write</p>

<p>Should we not be greatly disappointed? <br/>
We should; and so with them if they should ask us for our records <br/>
and say that Jesus and the angels told us that you were building <br/>
up Zion and doing a great work in the earth and that great and <br/>
glorious things were revealed unto you and we now wish to read those <br/>
things. <strike>an</strike> And should we tell them that we had done as they had <br/>

to both tha<strike>t</strike>y and us. Then let us lay these things to heart and <br/>
keep a true and faithful record that we may be justified <br/>

<p>When I arose on the morning of the 9th I found the<br/>
earth covered with snow and that the city had been alive with our<br/>
soldiers since midnight preparing to go into the mountains to meet with<br/>
the enemy.</p>

<p>Col. [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] said to Maj. Allen, of our Expedition, whom they<br/>
had taken prisoner ""God damn you when I get to [[Fort Bridger, Green River County, Utah Territory|Bridger]] I will hang you.""</p>

<p>So Maj. Allen thinking there was not much chance<br/>
for his life and prefering shooting to hanging during the same evening,<br/>
though closly guarded by 24 men, pulled off his boots and walked up to<br/>
a fire to warm his toes and while steping around to warm his feet he<br/>
made a spring and cleared himself of the guard.</p>

<p>Escape of Major Allen From the U.S. Army</p>

<p>He ran into the midst of a herd of cattle so they could not shoot<br/>
him. Horsemen immediately started in persuit but in the darkness<br/>
of the night they could not overtake him. He ran in his stocking<br/>
feet in the snow for 30 miles carrying his boots in his hand not daring<br/>
to stop to put them on and arrived in our camp in safety.</p>

<p>Our men took 100 head of cattle one night and<br/>
300 head another which were now coming into the city.</p>

<p>On the 11th Dr [[George Washington Hickman|Hickman]] arrived in the city. He had<br/>
been a prisoner in the enemy's camp for a long time but they let him<br/>
go. 'Twas his opinion that Col Johnson would try to come in. They<br/>
talked of breaking up into small companies and trying to come in in<br/>
various ways.</p>

<p>There had <strike>been</strike> on the arrival of the first intelligence of<br/>
Col Johnson's movements been 1300 men ordered into the mountains besides<br/>
those already there. Col [[Philemon Christopher Merrill|Phileman C Merrill]] commanding the<br/>

<p>Conference commenced at 10 o'clock. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] made some <br/>
remarks concerning sending missionaries abroad and said he would send <br/>
many to the States if he could get those of the right stripe. He said there <br/>
was a great difference in men preaching and spoke of brother [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Clapp]] in <br/>
[[Texas|Texas]] and the Twelve in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]].</p>

<p>The statistical account at the financial affairs of the <br/>
Church was read.</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|D. H. Wells]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]] follwed <br/>
by President Brigham ^Young^ who delivered an interesting discourse upon practical <br/>
economy</p>

<p>The ^conference^ continued through the next day and the evening in the <br/>
Social Hall I addressed the missionaries and was followed by [[Orson Hyde|Orson <br/>
Hyde]] [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D. Richards]] and [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] and others.</p>

<p>The following day ^day^ we had an immense congregation and <br/>
a good time. The conference this day was addressed by Brigham Young <br/>
Heber C Kimball Daniel H Wells Orson Hyde Wilford Woodruff Lorenzo Snow <br/>
and F. D. Richards and others</p>

<p>Among other things President Young said that babes and <br/>
children gazed upon angels a great deal and they ^were^ innocent before God and <br/>
when they were brought up properly they would always be holy men and women <br/>
before the Lord.</p>

<p>The President also exhorted the people to se<strike>n</strike>t out fruit trees <br/>
and at the close of the meeting I let the brethren have about 300 peech trees</p>

it closed to meet again on the 6th of October</p>",

<p>They stoped a short time in front of the Governor's<br/>
Office and then continued their march towards the mountains of snow as<br/>
nearly 2000 of their brethren had done before. Many went with<br/>
wet feet poor boots and straw hats on and without tents or fire for that<br/>
night as they could not reach timber until the next day. This showed<br/>
the willingness of the Saints to maintain the Kingdom of God and<br/>
defend themselves against our enemies.</p>

<p>On the 26th [[Ben Simons|Ben Simons]] a Cherokee called<br/>
into President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] office. He had been two days in the camp<br/>
of the enemy. He said they wanted salt very much. Their cattle<br/>
were dying very fast and they were cutting timber and digging holes<br/>
in the earth which looked like going into Winter Quarters. The merchants<br/>
were suffering for want of food and they deserved it for they had been<br/>
the means in a great measure in bringing on the war.</p>

<p>Next day President Young sent</p>

<p>A Load of Salt As A Present to the U. S. Army<br/>
with a letter to Col [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]].</p>

<p>The President read us the<br/>
letter which was rich and interesting.</p>

<p>Arrival of Governor [[Alfred Cumming|Cummings]] and others in the U. S. Camp.</p>

<p>An express came in on the 2<strike>8</strike>7th in the night saying that Governor<br/>
Cummings &amp; Lieut. Col. [[Philip St. George Cooke|Philip St. George Cook]] 2nd Dragoons the<br/>
Ex-commander of the Mormon Battalion in [[Mexico|Mexico]] had arrived with<br/>
other officers on Saturday and Sunday last with about 300 dragoons<br/>
They had canvassed over the walls of [[Fort Bridger, Green River County, Utah Territory|Fort Bridger]] and the Corell<br/>
but their operations looked like temporary work and not like Winter<br/>
Quarters for the whole army. It was still thought that they<br/>
might attempt to come in.</p>

<p>Sunday morning the 29th [[George Albert Smith|George A<br/>
Smith]] and myself was called upon to go to Governor Young's</p>",
42829.0,114,,"<p>On the second day of the Conference the Twelve<br/>
met at 5 o'clock P.M. and blessed and set apart 88 missionaries<br/>
and during the Conference they blessed and set apart 255 persons</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff in company with others<br/>
of the Twelve ordained to the office of the Seventies [[Wilford Woodruff Brandon|Wilford<br/>

after me was 18 years of age; and I baptized his [[George Washington Brandon|father]] ^and<br/>
[[Keziah Fowler Brandon Cole|mother]]^ twenty two years before in [[Tennessee|Tennessee]]. His father had<br/>
been dead several years. I took him home gave him<br/>
a dollar and good counsel and let him go his way.</p>

day adjourned till October the 6th.</p>

<p>Incidents in the Time of our Famine</p>

<p>[[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M Grant]] on the Sunday afternoon spoke of [[Richard Golightly|Golighty's]]<br/>
shop being broken open and 150 lbs of flour taken from it<br/>
and that Wilford Woodruff lost 35 lbs from his buckery.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff followed and said that<br/>
those who took his flour if they took it because they were<br/>
suffering with hunger and would ask a blessing upon the bread<br/>
when it was made and send him home the bags he would<br/>
not bring an accusation against them. At the close<br/>
of the meeting the bags were put in sight and brought<br/>
me next morning.</p>

<p>The missionaries met at [[Salt Lake City Temple Block, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple Block]] and as vast number of <br/>
the people assembled and they ^were^ addressed by [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] <br/>
Wilford Woodruff [[Fielding Jeter Clinton|J. Clinton]] and [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]]. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] <br/>
came into the crowd and told the people to go home about their business <br/>
and for the missionaries to start upon their journey. So all the Elders <br/>
had their handcarts fitted up and started out. There was 25 handcarts <br/>
and from two to three men to each cart and many two horse teams <br/>
loaded with flour to supply the Stations for the carrying company <br/>
The Presidency and Twelve with hundreds of people went up to the <br/>
Bench and there organized and returned.</p>

<p>On the 25 of May my daughter [[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe]] had <br/>
a very severe attack of inflamation on the lungs or something like the <br/>
plurisy and could not breathe only with great difficulty. We bolstered <br/>
her up in bed and she would catch for breath like a person straugling<br/>
We annointed ^her^ laid hands upon her and rebuked the desease. I finally <br/>
got [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith's]] hankerchief which he gave me in 1839 and said <br/>
it should remain as a league between us as long as I would keep it. I <br/>
laid the handkerchief and she became somewhat better and slept</p>

[[Ezra Taft Benson|Ezra T. Benson]] [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] [[Truman Osborn Angell|Truman O. Angel]] and [[Phineas Howe Young|Phineas Young]]<br/>
Wilford Woodruff wrote them all from memory three days afterwards<br/>
and had them copied into the Historian's Book of Events. George<br/>
A. Smith's blessing was written at his dictation by [[Thomas Bullock|T. Bullock]]; but<br/>
the remainder Wilford Woodruff wrote.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/15/1856
42829.0,115,,""">15th</time> I met with President [[Brigham Young|Young]] at his office<br/>
with George A. Smith and Thomas Bullock and read Church History<br/>
to him. I was getting initiated into my office as Assistant Church<br/>
Historian to take charge of the Historian's office and business in<br/>
the absence of George A. Smith</p>

<p>In reading the revelation upon Patriarchal marriage<br/>
<strike>and while</strike> upon the paragraph relating to the sheding of innocent blood<br/>
President Young remarked that it was a very nice point to distinguish<br/>
between i^n^nocent blood and that which is not innocent. Were we now<br/>
commanded to go and avenge the blood of the Prophets where it would<br/>
reach infants from the cradle to the third and fourth generation<br/>
should we know what to do in such case? We should not. But<br/>
there is one thing that is a consolation to me and that is that I am<br/>
satisfied that the Lord will not require it of this people until they<br/>
become sanctified and are led by the Spirit of God so as not to<br/>
shed innocent blood</p>

<p>Again what does the saying mean that all<br/>
shall be damned who do not keep this law unto whom it is<br/>
revealled? Does it mean that they shall take more wives than<br/>
one? I think that it includes the whole law with its<br/>
covenants. I think that many who come into this world will<br/>
be damned or disorganized and I think that this is the ^second^ death<br/>
which is referred to that ^as^ the broad road leads to ^death^ while few will<br/>
enter through the straight gate into the fulness of eternal life</p>

[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] and others came. Brother<br/>
Carrington read the Proclamation in which A Cummings called himself<br/>
Governor of Utah and said that the [[James Buchanan|President of the United States]] appointed<br/>
him Governor of Utah. He commanded all <strike>the</strike> armed people to disperse<br/>
to their homes and said all that opposed them would be treated as traitors<br/>
He also wrote a letter to Governor Young accusing him of treason and<br/>
said that he should establish his quarters in [[Green River County, Utah Territory|Green River County]] and<br/>
organize a temporary government and that all would be tried for treason<br/>
who opposed them.</p>

<p>We went to the [[Adobe Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] and after the Preaching Brother<br/>
Carrington read the Proclamation and the letters</p>

the troops began to arrive having been dismissed by General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]]<br/>
and they continued to pour into the city until a late hour of the day.<br/>
Brother [[Henry Larkin Southworth|Southworth]] who had been a prisoner related to me his capture<br/>

with [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnston]] to let him go <strike>as</strike> to his family as they had nothing against<br/>
him only that he was a Mormon but Livingston would do nothing<br/>
for him.</p>

<p>He reported that there was much of the spirit of desertion<br/>
in the camp and that the officers treated their soldiers in a cruel manner<br/>
and that many would desert if they could. He said that the<br/>
greatest amount of any one article in the camp was ardent spirits<br/>
He thought there were 100 waggon loads of it. Howard Livingston</p>",

rest [[William Smith|W<u><sup>m</sup></u> Smith]] called upon the Government to furnish him with an army and <br/>
money and he would come to Utah and subdue the Mormons</p>

<p>In conversation in the [[Historian|Historian's Office]] on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of June<br/>
between President Young George A Smith [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] and myself the [[Brigham Young|President]]<br/>
said</p>

<p>There is no law in heaven or earth that would compel a woman to stay <br/>
with a man either in time or eternity. This I think is true but I do not <br/>
know. If a man who is a High Priest takes a woman and she leaves him <br/>
and goes to one of a lower office say the lesser Priesthood or members, I think <br/>
in the resurrection that that High Priest can claim her</p>

<p>Joseph Young: What if she should not want to go with him? I <br/>
should not want a woman under those circumstances</p>

<p>Brigham: I will tell you what you will find that all these<br/>
evil traditions and affections or passions that haunt the mind in this life will <br/>
all be done away in the resurrection. You will find then that any <br/>
man who gets a glory and exaltation will be so beautiful that any woman <br/>
would be willing to have him if it was right and whenever it is right <br/>
for the woman to go there she will be willing to go for all those evils <br/>
will vanish to which we are subject in this life. I have told the truth <br/>
just as it is but others <strike>will</strike> at times will get up and tell the people that <br/>
they will have no heaven only what they make in this life and that it <br/>
will be in the next world as it will be this. Now they do not mean <br/>
what they say. They do not explain themselves and hence the people <br/>
do not understand</p>

<p>Joseph Young said, ""I wish I knew what my limits are"" <br/>
and the President replied</p>

<p>""Your limits are endless and you have not go half <br/>
way to the end of it yet. Now when I was an Elder I was as </p>",

the army had a great amount  of liquor as well as all the Suttlers<br/>
The officers were drunk every day.</p>

<p>He also said that there was a division of the<br/>
officers as well as the soldiers. A portion of them think that<br/>
Governor [[Brigham Young|Young]] is justified in taking the course he does in his own<br/>
defence. Their animals were dying so fast that they all<br/>
expected to be on foot before next Spring. They had sent Captain <br/>
[[Randolph Barnes Marcy|Marcy]] to [[Texas|Texas]] to buy mules horses and oxen.</p>

<p>Summary of the Season's Expedition</p>

<p>The Expedition of the Season was now entirely<br/>
closed. We had clearly seen the hand of God made visible in<br/>
our behalf. An army had been sent by the United States to<br/>
make war for the sole purpose to destroy the Church of Jesus Christ<br/>
of Latter-day Saints. The Kingdom of God had been driven<br/>
from the confines of the United States into the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]]<br/>
then [[Mexican Cession Territory|Mexican Territory]] with the hope of the nation that we should<br/>
perish but as soon as they found that we should live and prosper<br/>
they became alarmed and resolved upon our destruction and now<br/>
the United States had sent their armies out to accomplish their<br/>
hellish purpose.</p>

<p>As soon as this was known unto us the [[Brigham Young|leader]]<br/>
of the Church and Kingdom of God rose up in the strength of Israel's<br/>
God and proclaimed Israel free. His Counsellors [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]]<br/>
and [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H Well]] with the Twelve Apostles sustained him and all<br/>
the people said, Amen.</p>

<p>He testified unto the people in the name of<br/>
God that if they would be united with him in their faith prayers and<br/>
works the enemy should not have power to come into our<br/>

do not see it so. Now if you should be with the Twelve or anybody <br/>
you would have a right to correct an error as well as with a member but <br/>
you could not correct them by cutting them off from the Church because they <br/>
are over you in the Priesthood</p>

<p>Prophecies of [[Joseph Young|Joseph]] and [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] <br/>
upon <br/>
[[William B. Smith|William Smith]]</p>

<p>On Sunday the 14 of June in the prayer circle the subject of <br/>
William Smith was brought up. It was said that Joseph Smith <br/>
prophesied that his brother William would become a good man when<br/>
he became an old man. Some of the brethren present at our prayer <br/>
circle thought he said if he ever did become good it would be when he was<br/>
an old man.</p>

<p>President Young then said whether Joseph said it or not <br/>
I will say in the name of the Lord that if William Smith lives till he is <br/>
65 or 70 he will become a good humble man; he will do the best he can <br/>
He will have to answer for his sins. Write this brother Woodruff<br/>

power of the devil he finds it hard to recover himself.</p>

<p>The Female Relief Society</p>

<p>On the 17th they met at my house. There were about 50 present<br/>
sewing knitting sewing carpet rags making quilts &amp;c. It is a laudable<br/>
undertaking. All the females in the Ward met at my house <br/>
each Wednesday afternoon. They open and close with prayer Mrs <br/>
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe Wo Woodruff]] was President and Mrs [[Mary Ann Frost Pratt|Pratt]] secretary. They clothed<br/>
all the poor in the Ward and during the last quarter they made a <br/>
donation to the Perpetual Emigration Fund of 126 dollars.</p>

and asked [[Brigham Young|him]] if he was satisfied with them. He said he was. The<br/>
President advised Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] not to indulge in arguing<br/>
any point question or principle which he did not believe for the sake<br/>
of argument or to draw something out of others as it was a dangerous<br/>
ground. George A. thanked him for his advise and promised<br/>
to follow it. Brother Smith also spoke in plainness his feelings<br/>
concerning some of the principles of Elder [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] wherein he<br/>
differed from ^the^ President concerning the creation of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] out of the <br/>
dust of the earth and the final consummation of knowledge<br/>
and many other things. Orson Pratt promised he would not publish anything in opposition<br/>
to President Young's views</p>

<p>On the Monday the [[Historian|Historian's Office]] was crowded<br/>
with clerks taking a copy of the census: 2<strike>9</strike>1 was the highest number<br/>

in a carriage and drove there to visit them and take minutes of their<br/>

and organized the company by appointing [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] captain<br/>
[[William Miller, b. 1814|William Miller]] captain of the guard Elder [[Ezra Taft Benson|Benson]] Chaplain<br/>
and [[James Ure|James Ure]] clerk. He gave them some instruction<br/>
concerning their journey and also gave them his parting blessing<br/>
Brother [[John Varah Long|J. V. Long]] reported his speech and Wilford Woodruff took<br/>
a list of the names of those going East on mission and found them<br/>
to be 36 in number. Professor Orson Pratt was going to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] <br/>

<p>From 2 to 3 thousand of the brethren had armed<br/>
themselves and went into the Mountains according to the counsel of President<br/>
Young and they were led by their valiant General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]] to hedge<br/>
up the way of the enemy should they attempt to come in. Our brethren<br/>
had made large entrenchments and ditches and piled up large masses<br/>
of rocks in narrow passes so as to roll them down upon the enemy<br/>
and destroy them should they attempt to come in. But as the<br/>
Prophets Brigham and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] had said so it came to pass. The Lord<br/>
fought our battles and hedged up the way of our enemies. When<br/>
they got to [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Ham's Fork]] 150 miles from our [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city ]]the storms and cold<br/>
killed their horses mules and cattle by hundreds so that when<br/>
the whole army got together with the [[Alfred Cumming|Governor]] and Judges whom the<br/>
Government had sent to rule and tyranize over us they had<br/>
not enough teams left to draw one third of their trains so they<br/>
were oblidged to stop and spend the Winter in the storms of the<br/>
Mountains and their wisdom seems taken from them.</p>

<p>Our brethren had been enabled to head then<br/>
like a herd of cattle and they had shot grape and musket and<br/>
minnie [Minié] balls at them from time to time and those balls had<br/>
flown like hail around the servants of God but not a drop of<br/>
their blood had been shed neither had the brethren returned the fire<br/>
upon the enemy even as much as in one instance. Fear had<br/>
so taken hold upon them that they would flee into their main<br/>
body at the approach of a small number of our brethren and the<br/>
Lord had frustrated the enemy in all their designs against us up<br/>
to this day.</p>

<p>Another Attempt of the Destroyer on My Life.</p>

<p>I have been marked as a victem for the attacks of the Destroyer<br/>
from my infancy up to the present time. I have faced accidents<br/>
misfortunes and apparently death so many times that it had become<br/>
a proverb with me to say that there has seemed to be two powers<br/>
constantly watching me and at work with me one to kill and<br/>
the other to save me. Thus far the power to save me<br/>
and preserve my life had prevailed. How long I should be blessed<br/>
with this preserving power and care time must determine</p>

<p>I had never until now been called<br/>
upon to war with poison and mortification in my system. But<br/>
such was now the case. I extract the following verbatum<br/>
from my daily Journal written at the time</p>

<p>The Constitution of the Kingdom</p>

<p>The great discourse delivered by President [[Brigham Young|Young]] on Sunday the 21st he <br/>
said among many other important items, ""The Constitution of the United<br/>
States was got up by inspiration. It gives all men the rights of conscience <br/>
So it will be in the Millennium. It will be like the Constitution. All <br/>
will have to bow the knee and acknowledge the Lord that it is his right<br/>
to reign but they must not blaspheme; but they may enjoy their own religion</p>

<p>Men talk about making a law to stop Polygamy <br/>
in [[Utah|Utah]] that would be an <u>expose</u> <u>facto</u> law and the Constitution declairs <br/>
that Congress shall make no such law and if the time comes when the <br/>
United States do make a law and send men to punish me for Polygamy <br/>
or having more than one wife as there is no law against it you may <br/>
make up your mind that I shall send them to hell. I do not <br/>
think they will do it but if they do you may tell them they had <br/>
better send 100,000 men with provisions for five years and they <br/>
may make their calculations upon it they will want to make forts <br/>
from one end of the route to the other, so that they can step from one <br/>
to the other. There is a sweeping clause against this proceding. When <br/>
they charter a ship company to build ships and control them they cede <br/>
up their right in the case. So it is in the Territories. They have <br/>
a Territorial Government. This people should have the right to <br/>
govern their own institutions</p>

and mortification to meet and that to in the worse form. There is but<br/>
a small chance for a man to live who is innoculated with poison and<br/>
mortification by dissecting the body of either man or beast. It is much<br/>
worse than drinking poison or being bit by poisonous serpants for<br/>
it is in a much more deadly form. Several have died this Spring<br/>
by skining cattle which have died. All should be more cautious<br/>
than what I have been in this matter, and not run the risk of loosing<br/>
their lives to save the skins of animals who die of disease. The<br/>
following account will show the opperation of this disease with<br/>
me from day to day and how near I came loosing my life: in<br/>

wrist had grown to about the size of a dime and had risen above<br/>
the arm and main ^flesh^ about half an inch and turned black <br/>
as ink. My arm began to swell and pain me and<br/>
I felt the poison and mortification working through my system<br/>
I called upon President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and showed him my arm and asked<br/>
his advice and he counselled me to go to immediately and clense<br/>
my stomach and bowels and poultice my arm with onions<br/>

He also advised me to show it to Dr [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Sprague]]. I did so<br/>
and he in addition to what President Young had recommended<br/>
dug me up some dock ^elecampane^ blazing star roots, and advised<br/>
me to make a tea of it also to make a poultice of it and<br/>
put in on my arm. I went immediately home and put these<br/>

command of a small scouting company. They took a horse from<br/>
the enemy and was fired at by them but no one was hurt. They<br/>
went back to their encampment. Brother Maxwell became<br/>
strongly impressed that there was danger in their way and that<br/>
they ought to leave their camp. He told his brethren this but<br/>
some of them did not think so and all went to bed. But these<br/>
feelings increased upon brother Maxwell and he arose from his<br/>
bed and told his brethren he was going to leave that place immediately<br/>
and they all gathered up their horses amd went several miles back<br/>

had just left was surrounded by a hundred men and had it not<br/>

disease and live to enjoy the society of your family and<br/>
your children shall grow up around you and you shall<br/>
be a blessing to them. Let your heart be comforted;<br/>
all shall be well with you: and I seal these blessings<br/>

all kinds of flowers and fruit. I thought I went East to preach and I <br/>
saw that the people in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] had dug down the mountain or cut it <br/>
down square and brought the soil out of the mountain and made some <br/>
good gardens. I went on East and I heard a Methodist Priest pray for <br/>
sinners. A man followed me and asked me if I wanted some <br/>
brass. I told him no. They wanted me to steal something<br/>
I told them I would not do it. It was <strike>makes</strike> ^moulds^ to make coin in <br/>
that they wanted me to steal. I saw ^stolen^ goods in great piles and stacks <br/>
that the people in the Eastern States had stolen; and some tried to <br/>
raise a mob upon me but I did not fear them. Soon I saw some <br/>
brethren. I saw one Apostate. He wanted to kill me. I told him <br/>
if he did not behave himself I would sent him to hell. I again <br/>
saw the brethren cut down the mountain and make good farms <br/>

him in the face and kicked him out of the yard. This did David <br/>
good.</p>

<p>I could not sleep in those days. I spent many a night, all night <br/>
without sleeping at all. I prayed a good deal and my mind was <br/>
constantly active.</p>

<p>Brother [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C Rich]] gave an account of the the death of <br/>
David W. Patten. He said as we charged upon the mob two men <br/>
remained behind the back. Patten took after one of them and <br/>
I the other and the man that Patten took after turned round and <br/>
shot him and he fell to the gournd only but a few steps from me</p>

<p>In the prayer circle on Sunday the 28th <br/>
President Young spoke of [[James Jesse Strang|Strang]] and his death and so did [[John Milton Bernhisel|J. M.<br/>
Bernhisal]] who thought that [[George Miller|George Miller]] was also dead. George <br/>
A Smith said that he was informed that Miller had gathered <br/>
the followers of Strang about 60 in number. President Young <br/>
said they made a business of stealing but let men come here <br/>
and they would see that we had shown the works of industry</p>

<p>[[William Wines Phelps|Phelps]] said the man in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] <br/>
Court House who said he would kill Jo. Smith and if the Turkey <br/>
buzzards did not eat out his eyes they should eat out his own (Phelpes <br/>
stood withing a few feet of him) while going home the boat sunk and <br/>
he was drowned and he floated upon some floodwood and the buzzards<br/>
eat out his eyes and flesh. Phelps saw his body after this and a <br/>
man said he had fulfilled his own prophesy</p>

and it had since troubled him so much that he had sold out and </p>",

a penknife but did not get it all out.</p>

<p>I was feeling a little better the next day<br/>
but still very weak and feeble. The dead flesh was parting in my<br/>
arm.</p>

<p>Next day I was able to walk to the [[Historian|Historian's<br/>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] asked [[William Wines Phelps|W<u>m</u> W. Phelps]] if astrology was true and Phelps<br/>
said ""I don't know."" President Young observed Brother Woodruff write that down <br/>
This is the first thing I ever heard of but what brother Phelps knew. He says <br/>
he dont know anything about astrology. But I believe it is true. So is <br/>
mesmerism or there is true principle in it</p>

<p>On Sunday the 29th in his remarks Wilford Woodruff<br/>
said he had faith in the doctrine taught by President Young for the rising <br/>
generation to go in foot instead of on horse back. He said ""I know <br/>
the good of it by experience. I travelled 1200 miles in one of my <br/>
journies on foot and averaged 40 miles a day; then waded the <br/>
Missi<strike>pp</strike>ssippi swamp from [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas|Little Rock]], Ark. to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Mamphis]] Tennesee <br/>
200 miles and only 16 miles out of water. One day I walked 60 miles <br/>
and while on journey walked 72 miles without eating and when I got <br/>
to [[Eagle Creek, Benton County, Tennessee|Eagle Creek]] with [[Warren Farr Parrish|Parrish]] I beleive I could have <strike>beaten</strike> ^killed^ any horse I <br/>
ever saw, walking to have followed it""</p>

<p>There is another thing I wish to speak of. We know <br/>
how things have been in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] the leaders of <br/>
the people were killed. If the time ever comes again when the <br/>
leaders of this people are called for I am opposed to their being given <br/>
up. I do not care what the consequences are for if any have <br/>
got to die let if be some of the rest of us who are not of as much <br/>
consequence as they are but I want them to live to lead Israel <br/>
as long as there is anybody to lead. Let us obey counsel in all <br/>
things and if necessary go into the mountains and we will increase<br/>
until the wicked will say let us not go against Zion to battle for <br/>
her sons are terrible and we cannot stand.""</p>

<p>Indipendance Day</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the city celebrated the day by a splendid <br/>
military performance. The legion met on the public square</p>",

had a daughter born that weighed 12 lbs, both mother and child doing<br/>

<p>On the following day I got all the dead flesh out of my<br/>
arm so that it was now fast healing up</p>

<p>[[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]] Nearly Killed</p>

<p>I had another shock of excitement to day. Wilford took the horses<br/>
to carry posts and poles to my pasture with the running gears<br/>
While coming home my new horse started suddenly into a run<br/>
Wilford could not hold them. They ran three blocks with him<br/>
and in turning the corner they turned the hind wheels three times<br/>
over with Wilford setting upon the exeltree. The horses continued<br/>
to run with the forewheels until they ran against the fence. My <br/>
son was stunned and picked up for dead but he soon came to<br/>
and finally led one of the horses home and a man rode home<br/>
the other. Wilford was hurt in one leg and badly jarred in<br/>
the head but he had a comfortable night's rest and I felt<br/>
thankful that he was not killed</p>

called upon President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] to ask him concerning [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]]<br/>
teachings upon the endowment; and how much we were to make a subject<br/>
of public history. President Young told us Joseph's instructions to him<br/>
concerning the 2nd Anointing and other Temple matters. See my<br/>

24<sup>th</sup> of July</p>

<p>I took my family in my waggon and started for the mouth <br/>
of the [[Big Cottonwood Canyon, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Big Cottonwood Kanyon]] on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of July <br/>
to attend the great Picknick party of President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and company <br/>
at the head waters of the [[Big Cottonwood Creek, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Big Cottonwood]] to celebrate the 24<sup>th</sup> of July <br/>
in commemoration of the en<strike>e</strike>try of the Pioneers into the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley of the <br/>

[[Charles Coulson Rich|Rich]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] and many others camped <br/>
with me. The whole road was lined with waggons for miles<br/>
and they camped wherever they could drive out of the road.</p>

<p>We arose the next morning before 3 o'clock <br/>
and started on our road. The Twelve followed the Presidency <br/>
and the guards. The string of waggons reached for many <br/>
miles. We arrived at the Campground at about 1<strike>3</strike>2 o'clock<br/>
and the last waggon did not arrive till near midnight. The <br/>

waggons; 1028 horses and mules 332 oxen and cows. Flags <br/>
were raised upon the highest peacks that surrounded us and <br/>
the stars and stripes were placed upon the highest trees. The <br/>

<p>President Young's Dream of the War.</p>

<p>At our prayer circle in the evening the subject of the<br/>
Kansas question was spoken of. Wilford Woodruff<br/>
asked President Young if he remembered the dream that<br/>
he had several years ago and President Young said<br/>
he did not recolect it. The following is the substance <br/>
of his dream.</p>

<p>He dreamt that he saw two armies meet<br/>
one came from the South and the other from the <strike>East</strike> ^North^ and<br/>
they met and fought and as fast as they were killed they <br/>
continued to have new recruits from the East and South.<br/>

<p>Legislative Room Burned<br/>
Dec 26 1857</p>

<p>Early in the morning a report came that the [[Social Hall, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Social Hall]] was on fire<br/>
I soon went over and found the room which the Legislative Council occupied<br/>
nearly burned up and part of the chairs.</p>

<p>On the 31st I called upon President Young and<br/>
asked his opinion concerning a Cotton Company. He said the time had<br/>
come for us to act and not talk. If the people had done the same as<br/>
you and I have concerning sheep there would now have been a good supply<br/>
in this Territory. And with regard to Cotton I am now going to send<br/>
men into the Cotton Country to make cotton for me so that I can have some<br/>
to use myself and if you or any of the brethren wish to join me you can.</p>

<p>I looked over my Journal for the year 1857 and<br/>
made up my usual Synopsis and of the events of the year I recorded my<br/>
reflections of the day as follows.</p>

<p>""It has been an important year to Zion and the world<br/>
1857 will be the year on history's page from which will be dated the<br/>
commencement of the downfall of the United States. For it is during this<br/>
year that they have ent<strike>t</strike>ered the field as open enemies and persecuters of<br/>
the Saints of the Most High God and and have sent an army of 2500 men<br/>
over 1000 miles for the purpose of laying a foundation for the destruction<br/>
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who have settled here in<br/>
in the [[Great Basin|Great Bason]] of North America, called [[Utah Territory|Utah Territory]] or the State<br/>
of Deseret.</p>

<p>Here in the Valleys of the Mountains is established<br/>
the kingdom of God which [[Daniel (OT)|Daniel]] saw by vision and the people of<br/>
the United States are determined to destroy the Kingdom of God from<br/>
off the earth. But these judgements of God will now begin to rest<br/>
more fully upon that nation and will be increased upon them year by</p>",
42829.0,217,,"<p>whole mountains and valleys were alive with men and beast.</p>

<p>At 20 minutes past 9 o'clock three rounds <strike>of</strike>were <br/>
fired from a brass howitzer for the First Presidency of the Church. Other <br/>
rounds were also fired</p>

<p>Each one enjoyed himself as best he could through the day <br/>
and night. I took a walk with the Presidency to his upper mill <br/>
there were four built and one building. I never saw finer timber<br/>
in my life</p>

<p>At about noon Bishop [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. Smoot]] Elders [[Judson Stodard|Judson Studard]] <br/>
[[Orrin Porter Rockwell|O. P. Rockwell]] and Judge [[Elias Smith|Smith]] rode into camp. The two former from <br/>
the States in 20 days. They informed us that the United States<br/>
had taken away the mail contract and that a new Governor and <br/>
Judges and 2,500 troops would start for Utah soon. We went <br/>
into the President's tent and questions were asked and answered and <br/>
President Young said that if General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] crossed the South Pass<br/>
he should send him word that he must not come into the Valley <br/>
If the Governor and officers wished to come and would behave <br/>
themselves they should be well treated. President Young felt <br/>
determined no more to submit to oppression either of individuals<br/>
towns Counties States or nations</p>

<p>At daylight neat morning the company began <br/>
to break up to return to their homes</p>

<p>While in the endowment house President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] <br/>
said he wished me to write an account of the sayings of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the <br/>
Prophet when he pledged himself that he would not speak on a <br/>
certain occasion until all the 12 had spoken. So he had <br/>
to sit three quarters of a day and hear the Twelve express their <br/>
feelings and he could not say a word. He then said to the Twelve <br/>
""You have caught me this once; and now I want to give you some <br/>
advise. Never get caught as I have. Never go into a <br/>
corner unless you can see your way out in some manner.""</p>

<p>In the Prayer Circle Sunday August the 2nd</p>",
42829.0,125,1856-06-25,"<p>as the living and are mixed up the same as the living are in a great<br/>
measure. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] and all the faithful Elders are actively<br/>
at work preaching the Gospel to the Spirits in Prison and preparing<br/>
them for the coming of Christ. The wicked spirits will gather<br/>
together against Joseph there the same as here but neither the<br/>
Devil nor the wicked have any power over him there but he<br/>
can disp<strike>a</strike>erse them at his will. Those who have shed innocent<br/>
blood or consented thereto will be angels to the Devil until they<br/>
are disorganized. Our dead children and friends are all with<br/>
us or near us. We are now in eternity as much as ever we<br/>
shall be. This great Sermon of President [[Brigham Young|Young]] was fully<br/>
reported and published both in the Deseret News and the Journal<br/>
of Discourses.</p>

<p>We found a great difficulty in writing the latter<br/>
part of the History of Joseph expecially the last few days of his<br/>
life as no one had kept a Journal of the same excepting Dr<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Richards]] now dead, and during the last days of Joseph's life<br/>
nearly all the Twelve were away on mission. This made me<br/>
very desireous to have President Youngs daily History written<br/>
so that all things might be plain to the future Historian.<br/>
The President told me that [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] in speaking of<br/>
the Church History in future said that it would be the History<br/>
of the Church and not of a man. I said very well; we could<br/>
not write the History of the Church without writing the History<br/>
of the Prophet and President of the Church. Brother Young<br/>
conversed freely upon the subject. I enquired of the clerks<br/>
of the President's office what they had written concerning him<br/>
daily. They read some to me and I did not think it sufficiently<br/>
full.</p>

through the States and tell the brethren to pick up their budgets <br/>

Let the brethren do this that go with the mail</p>

<p>The United States are fools to come upon <br/>
this people and so are th<strike>o</strike>ese men who are bringing great quanties <br/>
of goods unto us this season. If the United States send out <br/>
troops to fight us this season we shall whip them out. Then <br/>
they will send out reinforcements and then we shall have the <br/>
Lamanites with us and the more the United States send out <br/>
the worse off they will be for they will perish with famine <br/>
I do not think anything about guns or powder for if the <br/>
United States begin war with us I intend they shall furnish<br/>
us with arms and ammunition all we want. If they do <br/>
undertake it the Lord will lead them or let them go into a <br/>
snare and their folly will be manifest</p>

them you may look for one hundred thousand men</p>

stone into the bottom of the [[Salt Lake City Temple, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]] celler and let the men go and <br/>
save their grain and for each man to take what grain will do him <br/>
for a year.</p>

<p>Daniel H. Wells said that orders had been sent North and <br/>
South to watch for the soldiers and not let them come in but to <br/>
destroy them the best way they could. Let grain be chached in <br/>
the mountains so that they can get at it.</p>

<p>President Young said the <strike>t</strike>he thought it would be <br/>
best to secure the grain in the mountains.</p>

<p>It was said that [[Elisha W. Van Ettan|Vannetting]] had 500 lbs of powder <br/>
coming and he would go out with cattle to bring it in or he would <br/>
do as he was told. Yes said President Young except a righteous <br/>
course. President Young said I would rather have a good  <br/>
powder horn and charger than any flask in the world. He <br/>
considered it safer</p>

was about to leave us for [[England|England]]. He could not stand the<br/>
hard times and did not know whether Mormonism was true or not<br/>

James J. Strang who had broke off from the Church and<br/>
lead away a party. He was shot by two men who had<br/>
been his own followers. One ball lodged in the head went<br/>

of his meeting in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] at [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] house at the time<br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] preached the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and<br/>
Covenants as the Standards while ""I took the ground that<br/>
they were of no account to us without a living Prophet and<br/>
revelation."" I told President Young that I would examine<br/>
and see. I afterwards found that it was recorded in my<br/>
Daily Journal.</p>

<p>Next day I was reading History and President <br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] called. He said he told brother [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
to give me credit in the Church History for what he prints</p>",

President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said I think we shall use this room for a few years to come<br/>
yet I mean to be ready.</p>

<p>The subject of the death of [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] ^came up^. A foreboding of his death he<br/>
felt strongly in spirit. As he was about to start for meeting He felt this<br/>
so much that he said there are some man in this city who thirsts for my blood. As<br/>
he was about to start for meeting this feeling was so strongly upon him that<br/>
he did not wish to go. Brother Pollard did not think there was any danger<br/>
but Brother Pratt made him promise that he would protect him until his return<br/>
before he would leave for the meeting. At this very time Mr [[Hector Hugh McLean|M<sup>c</sup>Clean]]<br/>
had taken lodgings adjoining Parley's room and was attending his meetings with<br/>
loaded weapons seeking an opportunity to kill him. [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
advised Parley P. Pratt not to go to [[Arkansas|Arkansas]] but to go direct to Salt Lake<br/>
and take care of himself. He told Parley if he went to try to Protect<br/>
[[Eleanor Jane McComb McLean Pratt|Eleanor]] and her children he would loose his life; but he did not take<br/>
care of himself nor take George A. Smith's counsel but went to Arkansas<br/>
and was murdered by Mr M<sup>c</sup>Clean</p>

the Church and Kingdom of God had seen in this dispensation. The <br/>

<p>Synopsis of An Address<br/>
By President Brigham Young <br/>
Delivered August th 16th</p>

<p>When he arose he said he desired to speak as the Lord himself would were <br/>
he present. He then began clothed with the Spirit and power of <br/>
God, and the revelations of Jesus Christ. He recounted our persecutions <br/>
and oppressions for the last 25 years and then took up the unjust <br/>
course of the United States against us at the present time. Then he <br/>
told us and all the world what the will of God was and what his <br/>
intentions were. He would no longer submit to their ungo<strike>l</strike>dly persecutions<br/>
If General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] came here with an Army to destroy this people we <br/>
would destroy him and his army. They should not come into this <br/>
Territory nor into our cities to destroy this people. The United <br/>
States had turned mob and were breaking the Constitution of the <br/>
United States and we would now have to go forth and defend <br/>
it and also the Kingdom of God and should they undertake to <br/>
send an army of 50,000 or 100,000 next year we will lay waste <br/>
this whole Territory and flee into the mountains.</p>

<p>I will lay all my dwellings in ashes all my <br/>
mills in ashes. I will cut down every green ^tree^ and shrub in the Valleys</p>",

<p>In our prayer circle on Sunday evening President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] spoke upon good manners good breeding and setting a better example<br/>
before the world than they do before us</p>

<p>The mail came in on the <time datetime=""",08/28/1856
42829.0,131,1856-08-31,""">28th</time> and among the letters<br/>
received by President Young was one from [[William Smith|William Smith]]. Others were<br/>
from [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and several other correspondants<br/>
We found a strong feeling prevailing in the States against [[Utah Territory|Utah]]. Our<br/>
Delegates had not presented our Memoriel to Congress and the<br/>
probability was that they would not during that session</p>

<p>Brigham Still Governor</p>

<p>President Young on <time datetime=""",08/31/1856
42829.0,131,1856-09-02,""">Sunday the 31st</time> preached and p<strike>h</strike>rophesied concering<br/>
the opposition of the Gentiles. He said he was still Governor of<br/>
Utah and should be until the Lord saw fit to remove him. It<br/>
was a remarkable discourse and may be found both in the Deseret<br/>
News and the Journal of Discourses. This prophe<strike>s</strike>cy of President<br/>
Young has often been quoted by our enemies at the time of<br/>
the Utah Expedition as a proof that the Mormons would<br/>
reject the Governor sent which they did not and since it has<br/>
been often referred to and better understood by those who have<br/>
exclaimed Brigham is Governor of the People still.</p>

Elders and one Seventy.</p>",

in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valleys of the Mountains]]. Then do you not think that <br/>
our Kanyons will be a <u>depôt</u> for the bones of our enemies? I think <br/>
they will.</p>

<p>O Israel can you stand those things? (The shout of <br/>
""Yes!"" from the assembled thousands rent the air.) All you who are <br/>
willing to follow me in these things raise your hands towards heaven<br/>
(There were a sea of hands held up.)</p>

<p>I have had to hold the Indians here for years <br/>
from destroying the emigrants. I have had to give them <br/>
many thousands of dollars to keep them from killing the Gentile <br/>
emigration to [[California|California]]. The United States Government <br/>
now owe me $50,000 in my official capicity and they will not <br/>
pay me a dime but are sending armies at a great expense to destroy <br/>
me and this people.</p>

<p>But I will now inform them and all people <br/>
that if they attempt to make war upon me I shall not attempt <br/>
to restrain them any more but I shall let them do as they please.</p>

<p>The United States do not know what they <br/>
are doing and the merchants in this place do not know when <br/>
they are selling the blood of this people for gold. They were <br/>
not going to bring any goods to this place but now that an <br/>
army of 2,500 men are coming here to destroy this people they <br/>
can bring a great amount of goods. Let them take heed to <br/>
their ways.</p>

<p>If the United States send an army and a train <br/>
of goods here I may get a part of the pay which they owe me.</p>

<p>I now wish to say to all Gentiles. Send <br/>
word to your friends that they must stop crossing this continent to <br/>
California for the Indians will kill them for the emigrants <br/>
have slaughtered the Indians without any cause or provocation<br/>
and if the United States make war upon me I shall not attempt </p>",
42829.0,132,,"<p>Wilford Woodruff spoke to the Missionaries<br/>
for a short time and exhorted them to keep a Journal of their<br/>
ministry every day of their lives. He said I would advise<br/>
you to get all of your blessings written and preserve them</p>

<p>In writing your Journal I dont care of your<br/>
keeping an account of what you eat and drink or where you<br/>
sleep unless you should be in a desert or in a wilderness or on<br/>
a mountain and have nothing and then if the beast of the<br/>
field or the fowles of heaven come and feed you as the ravens<br/>
did [[Elisha (OT)|El<strike>ijah</strike>^sha^]] then I would have you record that but I do <strike>not</strike><br/>
feel to enjoyn it upon you to make a record of every official <br/>
act of your lives. If you baptize confirm ordain or<br/>
bless any person or administer to the sick write an account<br/>
of it. If you will do this the Church can obtain a<br/>
full and correct account</p>

<p>We are not apt to think of the importance<br/>
of events as they transpire with us but we feel the importance<br/>
of them afterwards. We are living in one of the most<br/>
important generations that man ever lived on the earth<br/>
and we should write an account of those important events<br/>
and transactions which are taking place before our eyes<br/>
in fulfilment of the prophecies and revelations of God<br/>
There are a great volume of revelations fulfilling in our<br/>
day and as they transpire before our eyes we want a <br/>
record made of them. If the power and blessings of<br/>
God are made manifest in your preservation from danger<br/>
and death you should make a record of it and keep an<br/>
account of the dealings of God with you daily</p>

<p>I have written all the blessings I<br/>
have received and would not take gold for them.</p>

<p>I am in the [[Historian|Historians Office]] and I<br/>
find it very difficult to get or find a record of events</p>",
42829.0,225,,"<p>to restrain them any longer.</p>

<p><strike>the privelge to leave</strike> I will give all people in this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] who wish to leave <br/>
the privelege to leave. I want all to leave who are not willing to follow <br/>
me. If there is any of my family my wives who wish to leave I will <br/>
send my teams and carry them wherever they wish to go. If it is to hell <br/>
I will drive them to the gate but will not let my teams go into hell but <br/>
they must turn round and come back but those who wish can enter in</p>

<p>I want the people to go to and save all their grain <br/>
and prepare to cache it up in the mountains but dont let your neighbor know <br/>
where you put it. I want you to prepare for a seven years siege.</p>

<p>Many other remarks were made and reported in <br/>
full by the reporters and all the congregation of the Saints felt to say Amen <br/>
to all that President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said</p>

<p>On the following Sunday I spent the day at the <br/>
[[Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]]. Brother [[William Holmes Walker|Walker]] spoke in the morning and told of his five <br/>
year mission to [[South Africa|South Africa]] and his return to America. He was <br/>
appointed to assist off the Handcart Emigration. He took charge of their <br/>
baggage which could not get away but wintered in [[Florence, Douglas County, Nebraska Territory|Florence]]. He started <br/>
the train this Spring which was on the way and would be here in a <br/>
few weeks.</p>

<p>He was followed by brother Rodgers who had been on <br/>
a mission to the [[Sandwich Islands|Sandwich Islands]]. He said but a few words and <br/>
then he was followed by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] who was filled <br/>
by the power of God and spoke quite lengthy. He said that if <br/>
the people would do as they were told they never should be driven <br/>
from the Valleys. If we have to take to our tents at all <br/>
we will not pitch them again as a resting place until we pitch <br/>
them in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]. He said that President Young said when <br/>
we first came into the Valley that we should lay up grain for <br/>
a seven years famine and we should let the land rest on the <br/>
seventh year. Brother Woodruff heard it. (Brother Woodruff <br/>
said it was written.) Now the United States are trying </p>",
42829.0,133,1856-09-07,"<p>as they pass along so complete as we want to make the History. But if<br/>
the Elders will take pains to write their official acts so that the Historian<br/>
can get hold of them it will be a benefit to the Church. The History<br/>
of this Church will remain through time and in eternity</p>

<p>Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] followed and confirmed what I<br/>
had said. He observed that he had reflected upon this subject for<br/>
years to know what a man should write and I have come to the conclusion<br/>
that a man should write his official acts in the Priesthood. I am<br/>
sorry that I have not kept more of a Journal than I have. I wish<br/>
I had written every man's name that I had ever baptized or<br/>
administered unto. It is necessary for us to keep a Journal</p>

<p>On the afternoon of <time datetime=""",09/07/1856
42829.0,133,,""">Sunday the 7th</time> Elder [[Enoch B. Tripp|Tripp]] spoke. He<br/>
said he had called upon Mother Smith and she clasped him<br/>
in her arms. (They were formerly acquainted) and she said my<br/>
son Enoch I am glad to again see you: I am glad to see a man<br/>
again from [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake]]. She cried for joy and said she<br/>
had desired for two years to be with the Saints in the valleys<br/>
of the mountains but others had hindered her meaning [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma]]<br/>
The aged mother of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said give my love to [[Brigham Young|Brigham]]<br/>

<p>In the evening after the Prayer Circle Brigham<br/>
Young [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] Wilford Woodruff and all at our circle<br/>
laid our hands upon Parley P. Pratt and blessed him: President<br/>
Young was mouth. I never heard a better blessing given <br/>
to man. It was not written at the time but afterwards<br/>
an outline was written by Elder Pratt and filed in the <br/>
[[Historian|Historians <strike>o</strike>Office]]. This blessing was given previous to<br/>
his going to the States where he was assassinated as he</p>",
42829.0,226,,"<p>to force a Governor upon us. We will not receive him. The Lord <br/>
has said our Governors shall procede out of the midst of us. This is in <br/>
the Bible. Brother Woodruff turn to it. (Brother Woodruff opened <br/>
the Bible promisciously and opened directly to the passage in the <br/>
30th Chapter of [[Jeremiah (OT)|Jeremiah]] 21<sup>st</sup> verse) and read it to the congregation)<br/>
Many remarks were made by President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] all of which are <br/>
reported.</p>

<p>In the <strike>t</strike>Afternoon [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] was followed by [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel <br/>
H Wells]] who spoke in the Spirit and power of God concerning <br/>
Zion the Armies of Israel and the Armies of the wicked. He was <br/>
ready to fight and defend Zion.</p>

<p>August the 26th President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said I have sent <br/>
General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] word that I wish for peace and do not wish to fight <br/>
anybody but he must not come here with his armies. If he does <br/>
I shall stop him.</p>

<p>The President said to Brother Mathew<sup>s</sup> when you <br/>
get to [[California|California]] you cannot strengthen us; you must be upon <br/>
the watchtower. The nation is determined to make us free <br/>
They are determined to drive us to defend ourselves and become <br/>
indipendant. The nation is breaking to pieces in spirit. There <br/>
is no union among them and before the United States get through <br/>
trying to destroy us they will want to let out the job. I told <br/>
the people years ago that if they would let us alone we would <br/>
convert and revolutionize the world; and if they did not let us alone<br/>
but undertook to break us up we would spread abroad the faster <br/>
and do the work so much the sooner; and we will do it. If this <br/>
nation now makes war upon us we will be free and build up <br/>
the kingdom of God the sooner. The people have tried all the <br/>
time to destroy us but they have failed all the time.</p>

<p>When the Government called for 500 of <br/>
our men they had no idea that we should comply with their <br/>
request. This plan was laid to destroy the Saints and </p>",

<p>At the close of the blessing President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
remarked: ""I am going to take a mission I will name it here<br/>
I want to go through this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] with [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] and<br/>
[[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J M Grant]] and I want the Twelve to go. (Brother Parley observed<br/>
Brother Woodruff the Historian is all of the Twelve here). Brigham <br/>
said I want to go through among this people and preach the<br/>
Gospel to them if I can get rid of some of the care of my<br/>
temporal business. I do not feel that I am in the path of<br/>
my duty to spend so much of my time in attending to temporal<br/>
matters. I think more of one soul than I do all that<br/>
I have scraped together. I feel that with the assistance<br/>
of my brethren I could make a great wake by going through<br/>
this Territory and preaching the Gospel to the people. I feel<br/>
that some men ought never to be called upon to do a day's<br/>
work but they should spend their time in p<strike>e</strike>reaching the <br/>
Gospel. They should have a man to take care of<br/>
their families. This should be the case with Parley<br/>
P. Pratt. He should spend his time preaching. We <br/>
should devote our time to the ministry as far as possible</p>

<p>When I returned home I found sister<br/>
[[Ruth Daggett Vose Sayers|Sayers]] and sister [[Augusta Adams Cobb Young|Cobb]] at my house. Sister Sayers wished<br/>
me to bless her as she was going to the States on a mission<br/>
I laid my hands upon her and blessed her and said that<br/>
all should be right with her and that she should be prospered<br/>
on her journey and return in peace.</p>

<p>Next day I wrote a letter to Dr<br/>
[[Asa Fitch|Asa Fitch]] of [[New York|New York]] and sent him a tin box of insects<br/>
from Utah including one Tarantula 2 bugs called Scorpian's <br/>
Miller 1 Tobacco-worm miller one small spider and<br/>
several grasshoppers ^&amp;c^</p>

<p>On the following day I wrote a letter</p>",
42829.0,227,,"<p>[[Thomas Benton|Thomas Benton]] then had orders in his pocket to destroy the Mormons if they <br/>
refused.</p>

<p>Jesus said the time would come when we should have to sell <br/>
our coat and buy a sword. That time has come and we have got to <br/>
go to and deliver ourselves from our enemies and the Lord will help us <br/>
He will fight our battles and we shall become an indipendent kingdom.</p>

<p>I feel well and I will tell you why. If I am right <br/>
and I know I am and that this people are much nearer their Father's face <br/>
than they ever were before. They are united and willing to do the <br/>
will of God and this causes me to rejoice.</p>

<p>This people now feel to say it is the Kingdom of <br/>
God or nothing. It is not my farm or my house but the Kingdom <br/>
of God. This is the case with this people. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] <br/>
said Old Buck was now free. The yoke was off his <strike>h</strike>neck and <br/>
it would not be on his neck again.""</p>

<p>On the same day President [[Brigham Young|Young]] came into <br/>
the [[Historian|Historian's Office]] and sent for me for I was at home and I immediately <br/>
went to the office where I found President Young [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H Wells]] and <br/>
[[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D. Richards]]. As I came in the President said to <br/>
me have you a team. I told him that I had a pair of small ponies <br/>
He asked if I could spare them. I hesitated a moment and <br/>
said Yes sir I can do anything that is wanted. He then said I have <br/>
a good pair of horses that I want to let you have as you are laboring <br/>
here. I was taken by surprise for it came very unexpectedly <br/>
to me. I accepted the horses and was thankful though <br/>
perhaps I did not say it at the time. Brother Wells went <br/>
and showed them to me and I took them home. They were a <br/>
fine large pair of sorrel horses and they were offered 200 bushels <br/>
of wheat for them that day.</p>

<p>President Young stayed 3 1/2 hours compiling <br/>
his history. He remarked that the revelation upon plurality <br/>
of wives was given to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] in 1831. He revealed it to </p>",
42829.0,135,1856-09-11,"<p>to Sir [[William Jackson Hooker|William Jackson Hooper]] Director of the Royal Gardens Kew<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. I sent him a tin box soldered up tight containing the black<br/>
and yellow Mountain currant of Mr. [[Luther S. Hemenway|Hemways]], some service-berries<br/>
one paper of Muskeet Seed and one paper of Mus^kcrew^. The<br/>
latter I could not describe. The Muskeet grows from ten to 20<br/>
feet high is a desert shrub grows in dry places has the appearence<br/>
of the black locus and has thorns on it resembling the prickly Ash</p>

<p>I called upon President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and asked if we should<br/>
send out Circulars to the Bishops for the cencus. He said once<br/>
a year would do. He told me also that we might move into<br/>
our new office on the morrow</p>

Office ^which was a part of the [[Tithing Office, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tithing Office]]^ into the New one<br/>
opposite President Youngs house. We had three large<br/>
Secretaries filled with books and papers: they were 6 feet<br/>

Secretaries desks tables &amp;c and about 1 cord of papers which<br/>
Dr [[Willard Richards|Richards]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] had gathered together</p>

his leave of us and started on his mission to [[England|England]]. Bro<br/>
[[Leo Hawkins|Leo Hawkins]] went with him over the Mountains and spent<br/>
the night.</p>

<p>Next day President Young went up [[City Creek Canyon, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|City Creek]] and<br/>
saw two bears: brother [[Frederick Kesler|Kesler]] killed one of them</p>

nor act upon it but he did act upon it in a secret manner and that was <br/>
the cause of his overthrow.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] also said that the United States are <br/>
driving this people to war sooner than is for their good for we are <br/>
civilizing the Indians and if they would give us time we would give <br/>
them a knowledge so that when they do fight the Gentiles they <br/>
would have the judgement and not kill women and children and they who <br/>
ought not to be killed. There are now many of the emigration on <br/>
the way to [[Carson Valley, Utah Territory|Carson Valley]]. The Gentile emigrants shoot the Indians <br/>
wherever they meet with them and the Indians will now retali<strike>t</strike>ate and <br/>
will kill innocent people. One woman who had fitted out to <br/>
home here to investigate Mormonism was killed and all her <br/>
teamsters and all these were killed through the folly of emigrants.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 30th of August we had <br/>
a good day. The Presidency and several others of the leaders spoke <br/>
In the evening at the Prayer Circle the contemptible speech of <br/>
[[Stephen Arnold Douglas|Stephen Arnold Doglass]] was read and the answer of [[Albert Carrington|Albert <br/>
Carrington]] to the speech was also read. Also the instruction <br/>
of Governor Young in case we were invaded by an enemy <br/>
Many remarks were made upon the apparently approaching <br/>
crisis. President Young said that many of the brethren <br/>
had many fears about the Lamanites because the Gentiles <br/>
were making them presents. You need to have no fears <br/>
upon the subject for if the nation gives them a few million <br/>
it will not be all that is their due and then they will turn round <br/>
and take the rest. We need have no fears but what <br/>
the Lamanites will be prepared to fill their mission. I cannot <br/>
feel that the time has come for us to do a great deal of hard <br/>
fighting. We shall have help and strength and the promises <br/>
of God will be verified unto us.</p>

stating that Col. [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] was at [[Ash Hollow, Garden County, Nebraska Territory|Ash Hollow]] with some 2000 men <br/>
travelling some 15 miles per day. Col. Sumner had burned some <br/>
300 Ch<strike>e</strike>ians lodges and killed some few Indians and 2 soldiers were <br/>
killed and 7 wounded. Sixty men with Captain [[Dan Jones|Jones]] and the wounded <br/>
were sent to [[Fort Kearny, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Kerney]] and the Chians overtook them and cut them <br/>
to pieces so bad that no trace of them could be found.</p>

<p>Our emigration was getting along pretty well <br/>
so that the Lord was hearing our prayers and hedging up the <br/>
way of our enemies. General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] was retained as the military <br/>
Governor of [[Kansas|Kansas]]</p>

Sunday the 6th of Sep 1857</u></p>

<p>On this day Thomas B. Marsh former President of the Twelve <br/>
Apostles was presented by President Young to the congregation for them <br/>
to look upon and behold the wreck and relic of a man who once <br/>
was an Apostle and the President of the Apostles but who had apostatized <br/>
and staid in the world until he had become old a cripple palsied <br/>
miserable unhappy and worthless so much so that his wife the <br/>
world and the devil had cut him off as ^of^ no use to anybody <br/>
He had now come to the Saints for mercy and help. President<br/>
Young made a few remarks concerning him and then Thomas</p>",

Holy Priesthood vested in us and in the name of Jesus Christ we do<br/>
dedicate and consecrate it unto the Lord our God and we set it apart<br/>
that it may contain the holy records of the Church and Kingdom of God<br/>
and we ask in the name of Jesus Christ that it may be sanctified<br/>
and holy unto thy name and we pray that we may be inspired by the<br/>
gift and power of the Holy Ghost while acting as historians or clerks<br/>
for the Church. May we keep a true and faithful record<br/>
and history of thy Church and Kingdom and of thy servants and may<br/>
it be kept in that way and manner that it may be acceptable unto<br/>
thee O Lord and unto thy servants the Presidency of thy Church</p>

<p>We dedicate this house unto thee from the<br/>
foundation to the top thereof and we pray that the spirit and<br/>
power of the Devil may never have dominion over any man who<br/>
labours in this [[Historian|office]], or place in his mind</p>

<p>We pray that thou wilt bless us O Lord with<br/>
thy Holy Spirit that we may never profane thy name in this<br/>

thy cause or grieve thy Holy Spirit in any way. And<br/>

wilt bless these my brethren who are my companions in this Office that<br/>
our hearts may be united in the bonds of the Holy Priesthood according<br/>
to the anointing and endowments given unto us that we may be<br/>

people not to apostatize and to look to him as an example of misery <br/>
and one who had suffered the wrath of God in consequence of denying <br/>
the faith. He wished to be forgiven by the Church. President <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] put the vote to the assembly if they would receive him into full <br/>
fellowship notwithstanding all his heinous sins. All voted to a <br/>
man to receive him.</p>

<p>In the Prayer meeting in the President's upper <br/>
room in the evening we heard letters read from [[Samuel Whitney Richards|Samuel Richards]] <br/>
[[Samuel Comstock Snyder|Snider]] [[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|H. S. Eldridge]] and [[Nicholas Groesbeck|Gooseback]]. President Young said <br/>
Brother [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] I presume we shall not have any one in Congress <br/>
next Winter to present our memorials and interest. (J. M. Bernhisel <br/>
I think not.) I think it will make some of the people squirm <br/>
when they hear that I am taking the property which the Goverment <br/>
has sent into this Territory. Some of our brethren going down <br/>
to the States met about 60 of the Chians. They were very friendly <br/>
to them. The Indians stole 800 fat cattle and the rest were driven <br/>
back to the States so the Army has no cattle with them only for <br/>
their present use.</p>

<p>Some said that they beleived that the Indians <br/>
who stole the cattle were half Mormons and began to damn them <br/>
Brother [[John Murdock|Murdock]] remarked we are all Mormons here in this <br/>
company and I dont wish to hear my friends abused</p>

<p>President Young said what will <br/>
the people of Europe think when they come to her that Brigham <br/>
Young is at the head of the Viglance Committee in [[California|California]] <br/>
and the [[Kansas|Kansas]] troubles and that the Government of the <br/>
United States could not remove him until the Lord saw fit <br/>
to let them.</p>

<p>The world accuse me of controling the affairs of <br/>
of California and Kansas &amp;c. The people believe that we <br/>
have a band called the Danites but how could they exist so </p>",

while they are beneath this roof; and may we understand our duty<br/>
towards them in all things</p>

<p>We pray thee to hear us and to accept of<br/>
this dedication</p>

<p>We pray thee also to bless the quorum of the<br/>
Twelve Apostles the Seventies and all the authorities and quorums<br/>
of the Church and bless those of thy Servants who are among<br/>

reading our record which we have kept.</p>

<p>We ask thee O <strike>God</strike> Lord to grant these<br/>
our requests and every other blessing which thou see^st^ we<br/>
need and in the end of our probation may we be saved<br/>
in thy Kingdom and the glory of our salvation we will <br/>
ascribe to God the Father through <strike>J</strike>Christ our Redeemer: Even<br/>

<p>Arrival Of The First Hand Cart Companies</p>

<p><time datetime=""",09/26/1856
42829.0,138,,""">September the 26<sup>th</sup> 1856</time></p>

<p>Word was brought in the evening before that two of the Hand-<br/>
Cart Companies were camped between the two mountains and<br/>
would be in to-day. So President [[Brigham Young|Young]] called together<br/>
a body of Lanceers ""[[Domenico Ballo|Ballo's]] Brass Band"" and the ""Nauvoo<br/>
Brass Band"" and with President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]]<br/>
Professor [[Albert Carrington|Carrington]] and many other citizens <strike>he</strike>in carriages<br/>
he went out to meet them and to escort them into<br/>
the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]]</p>",
42829.0,231,,"<p>long without sheding blood for we cannot find that they have killed anybody <br/>
But I do not know of any such men</p>

<p>I think that [[James Buchanan|James Buchannan]] has got into a bad <br/>
fix. He has got the yoke on his neck and has to carry it alone with <br/>
no ox to carry the other end. But he is pounding his own shins and <br/>
will soon pound the shins of others for the moment he gave consent to send <br/>
an army to destroy this people he placed himself as the shedder of innocent <br/>
blood and the judgements of God will follow him. When war does break <br/>
out between the North and the South it will be most bloody</p>

<p>[[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] said that the only way <br/>
for the President of the United States to get out of his troubles was to <br/>
get a bill through Congress to admit any Territory as soon as they had <br/>
population enough to organize a State Government and to be received <br/>
at once into the Union with equal privileges with the other States</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] then said let me suggest a <br/>
matter. Brother Smith is presiding at [[Fort Limhi, Oregon Territory|Limhi]] [[Salmon River, Oregon Territory|Salma River]]. Now <br/>
do we not want a station half way from here; say near [[Fort Hall, Oregon Territory|Fort Hall]] <br/>
Should we not send men, say 20 to make a Station there. (It was <br/>
thought best to do so) He said the North is the place for us <br/>
not the South. No one but the Saints would meet the cold <br/>
North country. This is the key of this continant and I think we <br/>
had better keep near the lock and have the key in our own hands<br/>
If we send a company we want to send them this fall so that we <br/>
can put in grain this season.</p>

<p>On the 8th Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] of the <br/>
United States service arrived in the city in the evening and <br/>
he had an interview with Governor Young</p>

<p>On the next day Captain Van Vleit met with the <br/>
Governor the Presidency and Twelve and some 100 citizens in the Social <br/>
Hall at 9 o'clock. He presented Governor Young with a <br/>
letter of instructions or request which was read before the Assembly <br/>
and but little said and a great deal thought.</p>",
42829.0,139,,"<p>They met the companies at the foot of the [[Little Mountain, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Little Mountain]]<br/>
on the west side of it. Elder [[Edmund Ellsworth|Edmund Elsworth]] son-in-law to [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]] was the captain of the first company and [[Daniel Duncan McArthur|Daniel D. M<sup>c</sup>Arthur]]<br/>
was the captain of the second company. Both companies consisted<br/>
of 96 Hand-carts 8 waggons and 486 souls</p>

<p>It was a very affecting meeting. Presidents Young<br/>
and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] walked up the Mountain through the company and saluted<br/>
the Saints and then organized the company for travelling into the city<br/>
One half of the company of Lancers went in front followed by the<br/>
Presidency and citizens; then the Marshal of the city [[Jesse Carter Little|Jesse C Little]];<br/>
then the bands of music. After the escort came Captain Edmund<br/>
Elsworth with his Hand-cart Company and then Daniel D McArthur<br/>
followed with the second Hand-cart Company and the remainder<br/>
of the company of Lancers brought up the rear. In this way<br/>
they started for the city</p>

<p>Captain [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard Hardy]] took Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Hunter]]<br/>
and myself into a buggy and we met the company as they entered<br/>
the borders of the city and we fell into the ranks behind the Presidency</p>

<p>The people of the city gathered on each side<br/>
of the road and the streets. It was affecting to see such a<br/>
strange sight of about five hundred people enter the city of the<br/>
[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]] who had travelled on foot one thousand five<br/>
hundred miles drawing their handcarts all the way. Women<br/>
children and old men had drawn their bedding clothing and food<br/>
all the way and this company of the poor Saints from [[England|England]]<br/>
had travelled the whole distance in nine weeks. They were<br/>
covered with dust and somewhat worn down but cheerful. They<br/>
had beaten any horse or ox teams during the time</p>

<p>The Handcart companies passed up on<br/>
South Temple Street, the Deseret Store, by Wilford Woodruff's<br/>
house down to the Grove and then down to the public square<br/>
and there formed into two lines and camped for the night.</p>",
42829.0,232,,"<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] asked if there was lumber to be <br/>
bought and grain and hay &amp;c. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said that there was <br/>
plenty in the country and asked if there was any one person who could <br/>
supply Captain Van Vleit with any lumber that he might want <br/>
Brother [[Samuel Comstock Snyder|Samuel Snider]] arose and said he could supply 10,000 feet <br/>
of lumber. No one else said anything</p>

<p>President Young had a private conversation with <br/>
Captain Van Vleit in the afternoon and walked with him through <br/>
his garden and orchard and through Professor [[Albert Carrington|Carrington's]]. The <br/>
Captain asked Mrs [[Rhoda Maria Woods Carrington|Carrington]] if she was willing to cut down her <br/>
fine peach orchard for her faith and religion. She said yes <br/>
and would set up nights to do it if it became necessary.</p>

<p>On the next day President Young took the <br/>
Captain through his house and introduced him to his family</p>

<p>On the 12th we got an express in the <br/>
morning saying that there were some 900 troops on the way this <br/>
side of the [[Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]] and some 12 Government baggage trains.</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] came into the [[President|Office]] <br/>
this day and President Young had a good deal of talk with him.<br/>
He said I do not want to fight the United States but if they drive us <br/>
to it we shall do the best we can and I tell you as God lives we <br/>
shall come off conquerer for we trust in God. For God has<br/>
set up his kingdom upon the earth and it will never fall but it will <br/>
stand. We shall do all we can not to fight but if they drive us to it <br/>
God will overthrow them. If they would let us alone and say to the <br/>
mobs now you may go and kill the <strike>m</strike>Mormons if you can but we <br/>
will have nothing to do with it, this is all we would ask of them <br/>
But for the Government of the United States to array their armies <br/>
against us it is too dispicable and damnable for any honourable nation <br/>
and God will have them in derision for doing it</p>

<p>The Government has all the time <br/>
endeavoured to destroy us in an underhanded manner; but now if</p>",
42829.0,140,,"<p>As soon as they were camped President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
stood up in his carriage and called upon the Bishops and<br/>
multitude who had gathered together to see the Handcart Companies<br/>
to bring them provisions and feed them to night to morrow<br/>
morning and noon and night again and while they stop here<br/>
I wish you all to tarry here until you are dismissed and I bless<br/>
you all in doing good and keeping the commandments of God</p>

<p>We then returned to our homes and<br/>
the Bishops and people brought the Hand Cart companies <br/>
all the provisions necessary</p>

<p>Captain [[Edmund Ellsworth|Edmund Elsworth]] saluted his wives and<br/>
children as he passed his house but did not stop for anything<br/>
until his company was camped. He led the First Handcart<br/>
company by drawing the front handcart with three other^s^<br/>
breathren drawing their handcarts with him in the frontrank</p>

<p>Next day I call upon President Young<br/>
upon Church business. Among other things he said he<br/>
thought these hand cart compan<strike>y</strike>i^es^ had a better time than the<br/>
teams had. ""They have not had as hard a time as<br/>
we had in going to [[Missouri|Missouri]] in 183<strike>3</strike>^4^. Then I went<br/>
to Missouri stayed in the cholera 15 days then returned to <br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] within three months making over 3000 miles <strike>which</strike><br/>
^and^ I walked all the way and <strike>lay</strike> ^laid^ on the ground every night; but<br/>
if I had to fit out a company I would have fitted out the<br/>
carts different to what they were.""</p>

<p>During the moring Presidents Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
[[Albert Carrington|Albert Carrington]] Edmund Elsworth and myself rode down<br/>
to the Public Square to visit the Handcart Companies. The<br/>
emigrant Saints generally looked well and cheerful. They<br/>
shook our hands warmly. There was a great quantity<br/>
of provisions on hand in the camp brought in by the citizens<br/>
I laid hands upon one of the bretheren who was taken sick</p>",
42829.0,233,,"<p>they come against us we will whip them all the time and you will see that <br/>
we will do it. The United States are sending their armies to hold us still <br/>
until a mob can come and kill us and they have done this all the time</p>

<p>We are the supporters of the United States Constitution <br/>
and we love the Constitution and laws of the United States but it is the <br/>
corrupt administeration of those laws that we are suffering under and <br/>
not the laws.</p>

<p>If the laws had been carried out in the [[Missouri|Missouri]] it would have <br/>
hung Governor [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]] between the heavens and the earth and all his friends <br/>
who was in the murdering and expelling of the Saints from the States. They <br/>
shot down the Mormons whenever they could. They killed [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and <br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]. Then when Col. [[John J. Hardin|Hardan]] came into [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with his armies <br/>
he did not enquire who killed Joseph Smith and Hyrum nor any of the <br/>
Saints who had been killed but enquired for some missing man that we <br/>
knew nothing about and said he should hold me responsible for the life <br/>
of that man.</p>

<p>This has been the course with the Government all the time <br/>
We got up a ""memorial"" or ""Declaration"" to the Congress of the United <br/>
States last Winter</p>

<p>The Declaration was then read to Captain Van Vleit who <br/>
after hearing it said, ""I cannot find any fault with it only it is couched in <br/>
very strong language."" President Young replied, ""That is what I intended <br/>
and I will now ask Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] if [[William Wormer Drummond|Drummond]] was not the main <br/>
cause of the United States sending their armies against us?""</p>

<p>The Captain said ""I think it is;"" and the President <br/>
continued, ""There is not any of the Government officers which have been <br/>
sent here who have any interests with us but they have tried to destroy <br/>
us.</p>

<p>Captain Van Vleit said this is the case with most men in the <br/>
Territories. They receive their offices as steping stones to the senatorship <br/>
but they have no interest with the people. This people have been <br/>
lied about the worst of ^any^ people I ever saw. The greatest hold the </p>",
42829.0,141,,"<p>during the night. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said the people might have<br/>
their handcarts</p>

<p>Brother [[Edmund Ellsworth|Elsworth]] pointed out a mule which he rode<br/>
after a Buffalo which he had wounded. The mule took right<br/>
after the buffalo and the mad wounded animal turned and<br/>
took after the mule. They almost met together when the<br/>
^mule^ turned and ran back so suddenly that he threw Elsworth to the<br/>
ground. The buffalo plunged at him and Elsworth<br/>
punched the aminal with the mu<strike>g</strike>zgle of his gun in the<br/>
eye so hard a blow that the buffalo fell to his knees but got<br/>
up again and ran away. It broke the rifle. Brother Elsworth<br/>
was a very strong man. His mule ran five miles to camp<br/>
and he had to walk</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday and several of the<br/>
returned missionaries spoke to the congregation</p>

<p>The Place Where [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] Offered His First Sacrifice</p>

<p>President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] said I have told the people to day<br/>
far greater things than drawing hand carts to Zion [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph<br/>
Smith]] took President Brigham Young and myself to the very<br/>
spot in [[Adam-ondi-Ahman, Daviess County, Missouri|Adam-Ondi-Aman]] where Adam offered up his first<br/>
sacrifice on a spot now called Hogback</p>

<p>Dream of [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H Wells]]</p>

<p>Daniel H Wells said I had a dream last night and I saw a<br/>
butcher's cleaver in the heavens in the East and I tried to ^show it to^ Bishop<br/>
[[David Pettegrew|Pettigrew]] and he could not see it. I felt that there was a struggle<br/>
near and a great slaughter and much nearer than the people<br/>
are aware of</p>

<p>President Kimball said it would be better</p>",
42829.0,234,,"<p>world have now upon you is they accuse you of burning 900 vol<sup><u>s</u></sup> of the <br/>
United States Statutes</p>

<p>[[Thomas Williams|Thomas Williams]] who was one of the oweners of the <br/>
books which were burned denies that there were any of the books of the <br/>
United States burned.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said I have told the people all the <br/>
time that all I asked of them was to tell the truth about us to pay <br/>
their debts steal nothing and they are welcome to go their way</p>

<p>Now if this Government was arrived at that State<br/>
that they will try to kill the people for their religion no honourable men should <br/>
be afraid of them.</p>

<p>President Young then told the story about the Qu<strike>c</strike>aker<br/>
whom the Yankee went to whip. The quaker said that he was not <br/>
the man that he wanted. He had not done anything wrong but the <br/>
man said he would whip him anyhow. So the quaker laid <br/>
down his hat and coat and said ""Lie there religion until I whip this man""<br/>
and he did whip tremendiously. It will be so with the United <br/>
States. If they insist in whipping us they will get awfully whipped</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]], we have treated all <br/>
men as well as we have you who have been sent here as officers of the <br/>
the United States Government. We wish still to treat them well <br/>
and we would like to ward off this blow if we could. But the <br/>
United States are determined to drive us to fight. We cannot do <br/>
anything but what the Government will take exception to it. They <br/>
will kill us if they can. I have proof of this. They killed <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] in jail notwithstanding the faith of the Governor<br/>
the army and the States was pledged to protect them and when they <br/>
had killed them they got a writ for me. I carried a large bowie <br/>
knife with and I said that any man who laid hands upon my <br/>
sholder and said Mr Young you are my prisoner I would send <br/>
that man to hell across lots. I have said that all the time <br/>
since and I say it now</p>",

<p>I met with Presidents [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]]<br/>
and [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jed<strike>i</strike>ediah M. Grant]] at the [[Endowment House, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|House of the Lord]] for the purpose<br/>
of dedicating the Baptisimal Font built on the East side of the<br/>
House of the Lord.</p>

<p>There were also present besides the Presidency and<br/>
Wilford Woodruff Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Edward Hunter]] [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] President<br/>
of the Seventies [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]] [[Albert Carrington|Albert Carrington]], [[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard<br/>
W. Hardy]] [[Jesse Carter Little|Jesse C Little]] and [[Gilbert Clements|Gilbert Clements]].</p>

<p>Dedication Prayer By Heber C Kimball</p>

<p>President Young called upon Heber C Kimball to be<br/>
mouth in the Dedication Prayer. The following is a <br/>
Synopsis of it reported by Wilford Woodruff</p>

<p>""O, God the Eternal Father, we bow down<br/>
before thee on this Font which has been made by thy servants<br/>
to baptize thy people in, for the purpose of dedicating it unto<br/>
the Lord our God.</p>

<p>We dedicate ourselves before thee O Lord<br/>
and we ask thee in the name of Jesus Christ to forgive us all<br/>
our sins, that we may have thy Holy Spirit to guide us in<br/>
all things that we may be guided in the ways of the Lord and<br/>
that we may never do wrong. Look upon us O God who<br/>
have now bowed before thee around this Font and help us to<br/>
do thy will in all things, acknowledge thee in all things<br/>
and honour thee and worship thee at all times. Help </p>",
42829.0,235,,"<p>I have broken no law, neither will I be taken by any <br/>
United States officers to be killed as they have killed [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. They did once <br/>
take a bogus [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] which was brother [[William Miller, b. 1814|Miller]] and took him to [[Carthage Jail, Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] and <br/>
did not find out his mistake until they got him there</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] said I do not think that it is the <br/>
intention of the Government to take you but to install a new Governor in this <br/>
Territory.</p>

<p>President Young replied ""I believe you tell the truth—that you believe <br/>
this but you do not know their intentions as well as I do. When you  get <br/>
away from here you will think of a great many things which you have seen <br/>
and heard. The people have all the time accused us of colleaguing <br/>
with the Indians against the Government and they were much afraid that <br/>
Joseph Smith would go among the Indians and they watched to keep him <br/>
away from them but now they have driven us into their midst. And<br/>
now I want you to watch the signs and you will see that God will work <br/>
against the nation who are trying to destroy both the Indians and the <br/>
Mormons. The Government has become corrupt and they are the <br/>
ones who are breaking the Constitution of the United States and if it is <br/>
ever saved it will be saved by the Mormons who are the Elders <br/>
of Israel.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 13th after [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] had spoken President <br/>
Young followed and said that he had the persecution of the Saints before <br/>
him all the morning, that he was righteously angry; that he was <br/>
so angry he could not preach. But he did preach in the power of <br/>
God and told his feelings.</p>

<p>Captain Van Vleit sat by and when President <br/>
Young spoke of the wickedness and corruption of the Government it made <br/>
him feel</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting we met with the Missionaries who <br/>
were appointed to lecture upon home manufactures. We then went <br/>
into council with the Presidency to select a company of Missionaries <br/>
to go and make a settlement on Blackfoot Fork 63 volunteered</p>",
42829.0,143,,"<p>us to honour our tabernacles that we may never disgrace ourselves in<br/>
anything. Grant unto us thy Holy Spirit that it may quicken<br/>
our understanding and bring to our rememberance all things which are<br/>

<p>We now dedicate this Font to thee O, God. We<br/>
consecrate it unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ. Let thy<strike>ine</strike><br/>
angel O Lord touch this water and this Font with his finger that<br/>
it may be holy unto the Lord. May no unclean thing ever<br/>
enter into this font to polute it. We dedicate ourselves our<br/>

May we be thine for ever and all that we have</p>

<p>Now O Lord accept of this dedication at<br/>
our hands and as we go into this water may our sins be forgiven<br/>
and not be remembered against us any more. May we feel<br/>
the power of God and have power to work a great reformation<br/>
among this people; and may this people triumph over our<br/>
enemies; and may not our enemies <strike>h</strike>ever again have power<br/>
over us. But wil<strike>l</strike>t thou cause thine indignation to burn<br/>
against them that they shall not have any power to do thy<br/>
people harm.</p>

<p>Now O Lord look down upon thy servant<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham]] and clothe him with thy power that he may know the<br/>
workings of the power of the Devil in the Church and among<br/>
this people; and may he have power to stretch forth his<br/>
hand unto thy people and do thy work.</p>

<p>We now dedicate this font to baptize the<br/>
living and the living for the dead and for every purpose which<br/>
is necessary to perform the work of the Lord our God even that<br/>
the generations which are dead and passed away may be saved<br/>
and that the sins of the living may be washed away and<br/>
that the sick may be healed of every infirmity that we <br/>
may be renewed in body and spirit in all things. </p>",

<p>At the close of this Council I went direct to the <br/>
meeting at the [[Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] and during the afternoon President [[Brigham Young|Young]] spoke and <br/>
gave Uncle Sam considerable hell fire for their wickedness. We then <br/>
went into our Prayer Circle and President Young feasted the brethren upon <br/>
peaches and grapes as we had nothing to eat during the day. At the <br/>
close of prayers Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] met us at the stairs and said he <br/>
had an express from the States and wished to meet with Governor Young</p>

<p>President Young's Last, Important Interview with Cap. Van Vleit<br/>
Sunday Evening Sep<sup><u>r</u></sup> 13, 1857</p>

<p>In the evening I went to Captain [[William Henry Hooper|Hooper's]] and met with Captain <br/>
Van Vleit, and a short time after President Brigham Young [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]] <br/>
[[Albert Carrington|A. Carrington]] [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and a number of others came in. <br/>
Captain Van Vleit was preparing to leave at 3 o'clock in the morning <br/>
and President Young was now to have his last interview with him and <br/>
he wish^ed^ to talk to him in a plain manner</p>

<p>President Young said he wished Captain Van Vleit <br/>
to report at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] just as things were here. He said I have <br/>
seen the sufferings of this people through their persecutions from the <br/>
people of the United States for the last 25 years and I will not hear it <br/>
any longer.</p>

<p>We have always treated the United States officers well but <br/>
they have constantly lied about us and tried to destroy us all the <br/>
time. We would still have received their Governors and officers<br/>
if they had sent them here without an army; but inasmuch as they <br/>
are now disposed to send an army here to hold as while others run <br/>
their red hot iron into us and then kill us we will now say we <br/>
will not have either their soldiers armies or officers any more here <br/>
at all and you may tell them so. We will just fight for <br/>
our liberty and rights from this day forth.</p>",
42829.0,144,1856-10-02,"<p>Accept of this dedication at our hands O Lord<br/>
and hear our prayers and we will give all the glory to God<br/>
our Heavenly Father; and we ask it in the name of Jesus<br/>
Christ: Amen.</p>

<p>After the dedication of the Font President [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]] went down into the water in the Font and baptized Presidents<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber Chase Kimball]] and [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah M Grant]]</p>

<p>Re-Confirmation and Baptism of the First Presidency and Others</p>

<p>Confirmation of Heber C Kimball</p>

<p>After the President had baptized his Counsellors Heber C<br/>
Kimball and J. M. Grant he confirmed and blessed Heber as <br/>
follows:</p>

<p>Brother Heber Chase; In the name of Jesus Christ<br/>
I lay my hands upon your head and I confirm you to be<br/>
a member in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<br/>
and I seal upon you the gift of the Holy Ghost and Eternal<br/>
Life and I ordain and seal upon your head to be a<br/>
Prophet Seer and Revelator in the Church and Kingdom of<br/>
God and every blessing which has been sealed upon you and<br/>
we seal upon you the Gift of the Holy Ghost and we seal you<br/>
up unto Eternal Life in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.</p>

<p>[sideways text] ^correct^ [end of sideways text]</p>

<p>Confirmation of Jedediah M. Grant.</p>

<p>Heber C Kimball then said;</p>

<p>""Brother Jedediah, In the name of Jesus<br/>
Christ we lay our hands upon your head and we confirm</p>",
42829.0,237,,"<p>Whenever I think of letting their troops come in here and their <br/>
officers I can see nothing but death and darkness before me and before this people<br/>
but when I say they shall not come here light bursts upon me and I can see <br/>
light before me and this people and this is the way all of this people feel</p>

<p>The intention of the Government is to destroy us and <br/>
we are determined they shall not do it. If the Government of the United <br/>
States persists in sending armies to destroy us, in the name of the Lord<br/>
we shall conquer them. If the Government calls for volunteers in <br/>
[[California|California]] and the people turn out to come to destroy us they will find their <br/>
own building in flames before they get far from home and so throughout <br/>
the United States</p>

<p>Again if they commence the war I shall not hold the <br/>
Indians still by the wrist any longer for white man to shoot at them; but I <br/>
shall let them go ahead and do as they please and I shall carry the war<br/>
into their own land and they will want to let out the job before they <br/>
get half through. And even should an army of 50,000 men<br/>
get into this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] when they get here they would find nothing but <br/>
a barren waste.</p>

<p>We shall burn everything that is wood and we should <br/>
burn every acre of grass and you may tell them that they must bring<br/>
with them their forage for their horses and mules for they will not <br/>
find anything to eat in this [[Utah Territory|Territory]] when they come</p>

<p>Again you may tell them they must stop all <br/>
emigration across this continent for they cannot travel in safety. The <br/>
Indians will kill all who attempt it. You may tell Judge [[Stephen Arnold Douglas|Douglass]]<br/>
that when he comes here again to enter into a treaty of peace we <br/>
shall dictate those terms of peace and not he as he did before</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] said that if our Government <br/>
pushed forward this thing and made war against us he should <br/>
withdraw from the army for he would not have a hand in <br/>
shedding the blood of American Citizens</p>

<p>After closing his remarks President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said</p>",
42829.0,145,,"<p>you to be a member in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and we<br/>
seal upon you all the keys of the Holy Priesthood even to be a Prophet Seer<br/>
and Revelator in the Church and Kingdom of God and every blessing which<br/>
has ever been sealed upon you and we seal upon you the gift of the Holy<br/>
Ghost; and we seal you up unto Eternal Life in the name of Jesus<br/>
Christ: Amen</p>

<p>Baptisim and Confirmation of [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] by [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]]</p>

<p>Heber C Kimball then baptized President Brigham Young and<br/>
assisted by [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Jedediah M. Grant]] he confirmed and blessed him as <br/>
follows:</p>

<p>Brother Brigham Young we lay our hands upon your<br/>
head and confirm you to be a member in the Church of Jesus<br/>
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and we seal upon your head the<br/>
Holy <strike>Ghost</strike> Priesthood with all the keys powers and blessings<br/>
appertaining thereunto even to be a Prophet Seer and Revelator<br/>
in the Church and Kingdom of God and over the house of Israel<br/>
and we seal upon your head all the blessings which were<br/>
sealed upon you by the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. And we say unto you<br/>
that you shall have power over your enemies and you shall<br/>
not be slain by them but you shall live to see them overthrown<br/>
and to see the Saints come off victorious over their enemies<br/>
And I seal these blessings upon you<strike>r</strike> in the name of Jesus <br/>
Christ: Amen</p>

<p>Baptism and Confirmation of Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>President Brigham Young then baptized me and all the<br/>
Presidency laid their hands upon me and confirmed and<br/>
blessed me. President Jedediah M. Grant was mouth.</p>

<p>""Brother Wilford Woodruff in the name of Jesus</p>",
42829.0,238,,"<p>God had set up his kingdom upon the earth and it was here and the Lord<br/>
would sustain that Kingdom and he would destroy all who fought<br/>
against it; and if the armies of the United States come against <br/>
us the Lord would permit them to be destroyed</p>

<p>At the close of the remarks the President<br/>
said to Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] as citizens we are friends and shook <br/>
hands in a friendly manner and wished each other well. We all <br/>
wished the Captain well.</p>

<p>I then went home and put up a box of peaches <br/>
of 32 dozen for the Hon. [[John Milton Bernhisel|J. M. Bernhisel]] and Captain Van Vleit.<br/>
I then went to the [[Historian|Historian's Office]] and from thence to President [[Brigham Young|Young's]] <br/>
[[President|Office]] and conversed with President Young [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] and [[Albert Carrington|Carrington]] until <br/>
midnight. This day J. M. Bernhisel was set apart for his <br/>
mission to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]. I wrote his blessing</p>

<p>On the 1<strike>6</strike>4th of September in the afternoon <br/>
President Young met in Council with [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] Daniel H Wells<br/>
and the Twelve and several others and resolved to proclaim the <br/>
[[Utah Territory|Territory]] under marshal law. The Proclamation of the Governor <br/>
was read and accepted</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th an express arrived from <br/>
the brethren in the Mountains. They brought word that 700 of <br/>
the army were at the Pacific Springs and that they kept but five <br/>
men on guard to take charge of their animals and they would not give <br/>
them guns for fear they would run away. They were travelling<br/>
about 15 miles per day. Their animals were much worn down<br/>
and the feed was scarce. Our own brethren many of them were <br/>
sick and were living upon bread alone and they wanted provisions <br/>
sent to them</p>

<p>Orders issued the next day for a number of waggons <br/>
to be fitted out and go with provisions to our brethren in the <br/>
Mountains. I was called upon for a horse team. Col Harman's <br/>
regiment was out this day with all their baggage waggons. They </p>",

<p>Baptisim and Confirmation of Bishop [[Edward Hunter|Edward Hunter]].</p>

<p>President Brigham Young then baptized Edward Hunter presiding<br/>
Bishop of the Church and confirmed him. President Young<br/>
was mouth and said:</p>

<p>Brother Edward Hunter we lay our hands<br/>
upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ and we confirm<br/>
you to be a<strike>n</strike> member in the Church of Jesus Christ of<br/>

in the Church and Kingdom of God on earth. The Spirit<br/>
and power of the Holy Ghost and revelation shall rest upon<br/>
you in power and we seal you up unto Eternal Life and<br/>
we seal upon your head every blessing your heart can<br/>
desire in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.""</p>

<p>President Young then baptized<br/>
the following persons:</p>",
42829.0,239,,"<p>made quite a display</p>

<p>Elder [[Nathaniel V. Jones|Nathaniel V. Jones]] arrived on the morning of the 25 from <br/>
the United States Army with the express. He visited with Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van <br/>
Vleit]] both regiments. The first was the 10<sup>th</sup> Regiment. This was a <br/>
full regiment. The officers were young and full of fire and they swore they <br/>
would come in anyhow; they could whip out [[Utah Territory|Utah]]. Captain Van Vleit <br/>
advised them not to come for they could yet nothing and they would have <br/>
to fight their way; but they swore they would fight their way through <br/>
After Captain Van Vleit left them they marched 30 miles the next day.</p>

<p>The second regiment they met with were old officers<br/>
They considered it the matter over more and thought it an imposition to be sent out <br/>
here and as a political movement to killed innocent people or to get killed. They <br/>
were to be at the Pacific Springs that night and our brethren were to commence <br/>
operations upon them.</p>

<p>Next day I had some conversation with General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] upon <br/>
the subject of going into the Mountains. He said he should soon go <br/>
and talke with him [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] as Councillors<br/>
He was going to take but a part of his staff and he wished me to stay at <br/>
home in the [[Historian|Office]] for the present. This was according to counsel.</p>

<p>The following conversation passed between President<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Young]] and Captain Van Vleit not before recorded in this Journal. Captain <br/>
Van Vleit said I think that Congress will try to do all they can against you <br/>
President Young said if God inspires any man to speak for us it will be well <br/>
We have got to trust in God. If you will speak in favor of us and I <br/>
think you will the Lord will bless you for so doing. He will require it of <br/>
you. We have refuted lies so long that we have got tired of it and we <br/>
shall now trust in God for the future. Congress could send out an <br/>
investigating committee to [[Kansas|Kansas]] or to any other place but to Utah. Upon <br/>
the mere rumor of lies they could send out 2000 soldiers to Utah to destroy the <br/>
people without investigating the subject at all</p>

<p>Captain Van Vleit said the Government may yet send <br/>
out one to Utah and consider it policy before they get through with it</p>",
42829.0,147,1856-10-04,"<p>[[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]] [[Albert Carrington|Albert Carrington]]<br/>
[[Leonard Wilford Hardy|Leonard W. Hardy]] [[Jesse Carter Little|Jesse C Little]] and [[Gilbert Clements|Gilbert Clements]] and<br/>
he was mouth in confirming them all excepting Daniel H. Wells<br/>
whom [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] spoke over</p>

<p>Return of [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin Richards]] and other Missionaries from [[Europe|Europe]].</p>

<p><time datetime=""",10/04/1856
42829.0,147,,""">October the 4th 1856</time></p>

<p>On this day missionaries from Europe arrived home. They<br/>
arrived in the [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]] at half past three oclock. The company<br/>
consisted of Franklin D. Richards [[Daniel Spencer|Daniel Spencer]] [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph A<br/>
Young]] [[William H. Kimball|William H. Kimball]] [[James Ferguson|James Ferguson]] [[George Davis Grant|George D.<br/>

[[Cyrus Hubbard Wheelock|C. H. Wheelock]] [[William C. Dunbar|Wm C Dunbar]] and [[John Daniel Thompson McAllister|John D. T. M<sup>c</sup>Allister]]<br/>
When Presidents [[Brigham Young|Young]] and Kimball met their sons and<br/>
friends with a hearty we<strike>a</strike>lcome the<strike>e</strike>re were tears of joy shed</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday and the day was<br/>
occupied by the returned Missionaries</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting President Brigham<br/>
Young went down into the Font and baptized men women and<br/>
children of his own family about 75 in number</p>

<p>Then President Heber C. Kimball went<br/>
down into the water and baptized about 75 mostly of his own<br/>
family but some were of my family and the families of<br/>
others of the Twelve and afterwards [[Lorenzo Dow Young|Lorenzo Young]] went into<br/>
the water and baptized 25 persons making 175 souls all<br/>
of whom were confirmed under the hands of Heber C Kimb<strike>l</strike>all<br/>
J. M. Grant Wilford Woodruff and Joseph Young; but<br/>
a few of the last Daniel H. Wells and John Van Cott<br/>
assisted in confirming</p>

<p>In the meeting this day President Young</p>",
42829.0,240,,"<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said I do think that God has sent you out <br/>
here and that Good will grow out of it. I was glad when I learned that you <br/>
were coming.</p>

<p>Captain [[Stewart Van Vliet|Van Vleit]] replied I am very anxious to get back to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]<br/>
as soon as I can. I heard officially that General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] was recalled to <br/>
[[Kansas|Kansas]] to officiate as Governor. I shall stop the train on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] on <br/>
my own responsibility and leave them there.</p>

<p>President Young said if we can keep the peace for <br/>
this Winter I do think there will be something turn up that may save so much <br/>
shedding of blood. Captain Van Vleit observed I think so too. The <br/>
troops will have to stop on Hams Fork; for their provisions will be late coming <br/>
up. I do not think there is more than 1000 troops coming. There <br/>
is one regiment from the [[Florida|Florida]] war. There is not more than 300 men <br/>
They have been reduced by the scurvey. That Florida War has cost <br/>
many millions of money. It was a speculating scheme. There <br/>
are not more than 100 Indian Warriors and they have got hiding places <br/>
which no man can find. It is seldom you can kill one. You may <br/>
accidentally storm ball into one as you would a patridge. Well <br/>
this Florida regiment are old men and the regiment is worn out</p>

<p>Sunday the 27th I called upon Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] to get <br/>
the History of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] which he had written but he informed me we had left <br/>
it at the [[Historian|Historian's Office]] the evening before. He was preparing to go <br/>
into the Mountains with [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|D. H. Wells]] <br/>
and his staff or a part of it. They got ready and left the city about <br/>
1 o'clock P. M.</p>

<p>On Monday the 28th we received an express from our <br/>
army in the Moutains saying that our enemies were marching strongly <br/>
towards us. The brethren tried to stampeded the animals of the army <br/>
but they found them all chaned by the feet, so they could not run; a small <br/>
company of our brethren also tried to stampede some oxen and they failed <br/>
in it.</p>

<p>Brother [[Nathaniel V. Jones|Jones]] informed me that Captain Van Vleit <strike>told the army</strike> ^tried to^</p>",
42829.0,148,1856-10-06,"<p>made a call for sixty teams twelve tons of flour and 40 extra<br/>

<p>The Conference commenced at 10 o'clock AM</p>

the<br/>

from the Presidency of the European mission</p>

<p>The other quorums of the Church were also numerously<br/>
represented on the Stand with the Returned Missionaries<br/>
and there was convened together a vast congregation</p>

<p>After singing and prayer President Young<br/>
said our Conference is now open and the first business is to<br/>
gather together the clothing shoes flour and the teams and<br/>
man them and start them <strike>back</strike> into the mountains<br/>
after the Handcart and other companies who are back on<br/>
the Plains. They were below [[Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]] some of them</p>

regiment swore that they had started for [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake]] and they would go there <br/>
The [[Stewart Van Vliet|Capt]]. told them we should not let them come in and they would find a <br/>
different warefare from anything they had met with</p>

<p>The [[Mountain Meadows, Washington County, Utah Territory|Mountain Meddow]] Massacre</p>

<p>On the 29th of September Elder [[John Doyle Lee|John D Lee]] arrived from [[Fort Harmony, Washington County, Utah Territory|Harmony]] with an express<br/>
and an Awful tale of blood. A company of Californian emigrants of about 150 <br/>
men women and children many of them belonging to the mobbers of [[Missouri|Missouri]] <br/>
and [[Illinois|Illinois]] had been massacred. They had many cattle and horses with <br/>
them <strike>a</strike>As they travelled along South they went damning [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
C Kimball]] and the heads of the Church saying that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] ought to have <br/>
been shot long before he was. They wanted to do all the evil they could <br/>
so they poisoned beef and gave it to the Indians and some of them died. They <br/>
poisoned the Springs of water and several of the Saints died. The Indians became <br/>
enraged at their conduct and they surrounded them on a Prairie and the emigrants <br/>
formed a bulwark of their waggons; but the Indians fought them five days <br/>
until they killed all their men about 60 in number. They then rushed into <br/>
the carrell and cut the throats of their woman and children except for some 8 or <br/>
10 children which they brought and sold to the whites</p>

<p>The Indians stripped the men and women naked <br/>
and left them stinking in the boiling sun. When brother Lee found it out <br/>
he took some men and went and buried their bodies. It was a horrid job<br/>
The whole air was filled with an awful stench. Many of the men and <br/>
women were rotten with the foul disease before they were hurt by the Indians<br/>
The Indians obtained all their property cattle horses and guns &amp;c</p>

<p>Their was another large company of emigrants who <br/>
had 1000 head of cattle who was also damning both Indians and Mormons<br/>
They were afraid of sharing the same fate. Brother Lee had to send <br/>
interpreters with them to the Indians to try to save their lives while at the <br/>
same time they were trying to kill us.</p>",

companies and bring them in. The vote was put to the people and<br/>
but few voted for it but the great majority against it</p>

<p>President Young spoke of the necessary of a<br/>
reformation among the people</p>

<p>President Kimball called upon the blacksmiths<br/>
in the congregation to return home to mend the wagons and<br/>
shoe the horses of the people so that they might start back<br/>
upon their expedition to help in the companies.</p>

were slain by the Indians. He had two of the surviving children <br/>
and he could get but one to kneel in prayer time and the other would <br/>
laugh at her for doing it and they would sware like pirates</p>

<p>An express came in at night saying that the troops were <br/>
near [[Fort Bridger, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bridger]] and had formed into three bodies in travelling. General <br/>
[[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] sent word for the brethren to let them come on to [[Echo Canyon, Summit County, Utah Territory|Ecko Kanyon]] <br/>
and there give them battle.</p>

<p>At 6 o'clock on the morning of the 30th the drums beat <br/>
and an army of soldiers paraded the streets some 400 who were in <br/>
readiness to march at a moments notice to the seat of war. We had at this <br/>
time about 800 men in the mountains. It was a solemn time the <br/>
armies of the Gentiles were making war upon us because of our religion and <br/>
we had to defend ourselves against a nation of 25,000,000 people and <br/>
the war had just commenced. We had to trust in God for the <br/>
result. We were resolved to do what we could and leave the work <br/>
in His hands. There was a solemnity resting upon our city <br/>
this morning; all were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the express<br/>
I told President Young that I was on hand at any moment to go into <br/>
the mountains when he would say the word. I went up in the <br/>
evening to the [[President|President's Office]] and learned that the [[California|California]] mail <br/>
had arrived. I heard some letters read, one stating that the Government<br/>
had made arrangements to sent up light drauht boats up the <br/>
[[Colorado River, United States|Colorado river]] with men and arms against us from that point</p>

<p>Next morning October the 1st I arose early <br/>
and looked for an express signal flag but saw none. There </p>",

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said he had never heard any<br/>
missionaries speak on returning from missions that he was more <br/>
satisfied with than with those who had just returned home; though<br/>
he was as well satisfied with the Twelve on their mission to<br/>
[[England|England]] in 1840</p>

<p><strike>Next day</strike> I spoke to the people upon the Handcart<br/>
companies; [[John Banks|John Banks]] followed upon his mission East and President<br/>
[[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]] delivered a brief but powerful address on reformation</p>

<p>Repaptism of [[Franklin Dewey Richards|F. D Richards]] and Others.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting I went to the Font and the [[Endowment House, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|House<br/>
of the Lord]] to assist in baptism and confirmation.</p>

<p>Elder Franklin D Richards went into the<br/>
Font and baptized his brethren the missionaries who had been<br/>
with him and their families and Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and <br/>
myself confirmed them. ^About 65.^</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",10/07/1856
42829.0,150,,""">7th</time> Conference was called to order by<br/>
President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] who rebuked those who were in the habit<br/>
of leaving during service or talking at meeting and he said</p>

<p>""You may say I am severe. I am not<br/>
half as severe as the Lord wants me to be. I have seen<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] when men were in Council meetings with him and<br/>
rose to leave cut them off from the Church before they got<br/>
out of the door. You tramel the Spirit and it is grieved<br/>
with the confusion and interuption. If you do not believe<br/>
this get the Spirit of God and come on this stand and<br/>
attempt to talk to the people</p>

<p>During the day a number of the<br/>
Returned Missionaries spoke and it was resolved that<br/>
the Returned Missionaries should stay with their families</p>",
42829.0,243,,"<p>was a good deal of anxity through the day waiting for an express</p>

<p>In the latter part of the day I called at the [[President|President's <br/>
Office]] and found President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] [[Albert Carrington|Albert Carrington]] <br/>
[[George Davis Grant|George D. Grant]] and [[William H. Kimball|William Kimball]] and an Express arrived from Col [[Jesse Carter Little|Little]] <br/>
giving an account of the number of soldiers which were with him and about [[Echo Canyon, Summit County, Utah Territory|Echo <br/>
Kanyon]]. As soon as we had got through reading his letter an express<br/>
arrived from General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|D. H. Wells]] [[John Taylor, b. 1808|J. Taylor]] and [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] sent by [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph<br/>
A Young]] and <strike>Joseph</strike> [[James Willard Cummings|^James W.^ Cummings]] saying that they had sent an express to the<br/>
United States army containing Governor Young's orders for them to surrender<br/>
all their arms and baggage to [[Lewis Robison|Lewis Robinson]] Quarter Master General<br/>
at [[Fort Bridger, unorganized U.S. Territory|Fort Bridger]] or to retreat back to the States or we should resist them<br/>
The U.S. army was encamped on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Ham's Fork]]. The Brethren were<br/>
waiting an answer to their message and would send an express in as<br/>
soon as they got it.</p>

<p>I expect the 5th in the President's Office. He heard a part of the account of the death of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] by John Taylor. He said what<br/>
there was necessary to put into Joseph's History and the rest to go as John<br/>
Taylor's History.</p>

<p>General Conference<br/>
October th[e] 6th</p>

<p>Our Conference this year of course was very materially thrown out of<br/>
its amout of business and importance by the circumstances of the war<br/>
against the Saints and the number of our brethren in the Mountains to<br/>
defend our cause our people and our homes. The Conference lasted <br/>
two days and then closed. The time was mostly occupied by the <br/>
Missionaries and the Twelve and President Young spoke at the close<br/>
of the meetings of the Conference</p>

<p>[[Lot Smith|Lot Smith]] Burns U.S. Waggons</p>

<p>On the 8th we got an express saying that a company under<br/>
Lot Smith had burned up 50 of the Government waggons and </p>",
42829.0,244,,"<p>while they were burning General [[William S. Harney|Harney]] and his cavalry came up. [[Lot Smith|Lot Smith's]] <br/>
company had gone East to burn up what they could. It was thought <br/>
that there would be decided action soon</p>

<p>On the 13th the brethren came in from the East and <br/>
brought in 153 head of cattle. Three teamsters and one deserter from <br/>
the army helped to drive them in. The deserter reported that <br/>
neither [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] Harney nor the Governor <strike>or</strike> Judges nor any of the Territorial <br/>
officers had arrived at the army nor any females. He said the <br/>
soldiers were only allowed 3 buiscuts 2 cups of coffee and a small piece <br/>
of beef per day and that they were not half fed. He said they had <br/>
75 waggons burned and the contents of 76. Two waggons were <br/>
saved. Captain Lot Smith saved all the private property of the<br/>
teamsters and when the waggons were burned they gave back the <br/>
teamsters all their arms ammunition &amp;c. Our brother had his knee <br/>
shattered by the accidental discharge of a yawger. They had <br/>
to carry him on a litter a long distance. He suffered much <br/>
with it.</p>

<p>The [[Sanpete County, Utah Territory|Sanpete]] company arrived in the city on the <strike>12</strike>^14^th <br/>
comprising 100 men and 11 baggage waggons. They marched five <br/>
men abreast. Col [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]] informed ^me^ that there were 1100 men <br/>
of our soldiers in the Mountains and 700 camped on the Public Square <br/>
and that we could raise 1500 men in this city: In 15 hours we could <br/>
place 3000 armed men in [[Echo Canyon, Summit County, Utah Territory|Echo Kanyon]]</p>

<p>An express arrived at 25 minuted to 6 o'clock <br/>
brought by Brother [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph A Young]] <strike>Jr</strike>. [[Benjamin Joseph Stringham|Benjamen Stringham]] <br/>
brought a letter from General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] stating that numbers of the U.S.<br/>
Army wished to desert and come into the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] if they had protection <br/>
The army was weakening daily. The chief officers sent a very polite <br/>
note to Governor [[Brigham Young|Young]] acknowledging the receipt of the Deseret News <br/>
which he had sent them.</p>

<p>Captain [[Lot Smith|Lot Smith]] had gone East upon his <br/>
mission in watching for the interest of Utah. The enemy</p>",
42829.0,245,1857-10-16,"<p>were mostly herried in but no disposition manifest to shed blood on either<br/>
side. The enemy were in a close place and their provisions fast diminishing <br/>
and but little prospects before them but starvation. We had prayed that <br/>
the Lord would lead them into the pit which they had dug for the Saints <br/>
and the Lord had heard our prayers and our enemies were now in the pit <br/>
and a fair prospect of their being destroyed without our shedding their blood</p>

<p>Letters from Col [[Edmund Brooke Alexander|Alexander]] to President [[Brigham Young|Young]]<br/>
<time datetime=""",10/16/1857
42829.0,245,,""">Oct 16th</time></p>

<p>An express arrived this morning bringing a letter from Col Alexander <br/>
to Governor Young concerning the present state of affairs also a letter <br/>
from General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]]</p>

<p>The brethren had taken a herd of cattle of 700 head and <br/>
were bringing them in. It was reported in the army that Col. [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] <br/>
would soon be up with 700 cavalry but this was uncertain</p>

<p>Col Alexander's letter was rather severe and <br/>
threatened us with extermination if we opposed. He considered himself <br/>
able to come in and carry out the commands of the Government.<br/>
Governor Young sent him a strong answer asking him why he stayed <br/>
in camp on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] for a month if he considered he had force <br/>
enough to carry out his orders. He gave him to understand that it <br/>
was now the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of the Devil and we <br/>
trusted in God for success and should go ahead</p>

<p>In turning from this subject to little children President <br/>
Young said when some people have little children born at 6 or seven months <br/>
from pregnancy and they live a few hours and then die they bless them <br/>
name them &amp;c but I dont do it for I think that such a spirit will have <br/>
a chance of occupying another Tabernacle and develop^ing^ itself. This is <br/>
new doctrine, yet it looks consistant. What period of demarcation <br/>
or age the Spirit would take another body we were not informed.</p>

<p>Sunday the 18th we met in the [[Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] and heard <br/>
The Correspondence of Col Alexander to Governor Young</p>",
42829.0,246,,"<p>The correspondence was very rich and edifying. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] then <br/>
preached to the assembly in a very profitable manner. He said he <br/>
should prepare for the wors<strike>e</strike>t and should have grain cached where the <br/>
enemy could not find it and be prepared to move into the mountains and <br/>
burn all. Yet he believed we could keep our enemies out and still raise <br/>
crops in the [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]]. He was followed by brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] who said <br/>
that he knew that if we would hearken to counsel that we should raise <br/>
grain eat peaches and apples and live in our houses in the Valleys <br/>
until we went to [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson Countay]]. President Young said I believe it</p>

<p>An Express arrived at 1 P. M of the 18th and <br/>
brought a letter to President Young from [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Daniel H. Wells]] and one to me <br/>
from [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]]. They informed us of an</p>

<p>An Adventure of Captain [[Lot Smith|Lot Smith]]</p>

<p>who with his company came near being caught in a trap by the enemy in <br/>
the following manner. About daybreak they came near the enemy's <br/>
camp and thought they saw a drove of mules a distance from the camp<br/>
They made a charge upon them to stampede them but as they rushed <br/>
in among them they found they were mounted dragoons. The <br/>
captain of the company sulated and said Captain Smith you cannot <br/>
see very good this morning. Captain Smith replied I can see as <br/>
well as you can with your blind bridles on. They looked at each <br/>
other awhile then Lot Smith trotted off at a slow pace but the enemy <br/>
tried to sworound them and they had to gallop over a very rough place <br/>
to get away. When they got about 30 rods away the enemy dismounted <br/>
and took a dead rest and shot about 30 bullets at them. One ball passed <br/>
through one of the brethren's hat and another ball grazed a horse's leg <br/>
That was all the damage which was done. This was the first <br/>
firing on either side and this was done by our enemies; but no <br/>
blood was shed except it was the blood of a horse's leg.</p>

<p>Col. [[Robert Taylor Burton|Burton]] with a company of dragoons or </p>",
42829.0,247,,"<p>minute men arrived in this city in good health and spirits. President [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] <br/>
addressed them a short time and said by virtue of the office which I hold I <br/>
bless you in the name of the Lord and if you will live your religion and do right <br/>
you shall none of you fall by the hand of an enemy but you shall eat peaches <br/>
and apples in this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] until you go to [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] Missouri and your enemies <br/>
shall not conquer you. Keep your guns and firelocks in good order and do not <br/>
waste your ammunition for naught. It is not a day for much preaching <br/>
but a day for hard service. This is not much that we have to meet with this <br/>
fall but next year we must be prepared for work. General [[George Davis Grant|Grant]] followed <br/>
with few words and told them where to go for quarters and they went to their <br/>
various places allotted them</p>

<p>October the 21st brother [[Dan Atwood|Atwood]] arrived in the morning <br/>
bringing an express from General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] and 2 letters from Col [[Edmund Brooke Alexander|Alexander]] <br/>
who closed his letter by saying that ""he should not obey the Governor's orders <br/>
and his final disposal of the troops would depend upon grave considerations <br/>
which I do not deem necessary to enumerate.""</p>

<p>The messenger said that the 5th regiment had <br/>
stopped near [[Bear River, unorganized U.S. Territory|Bear River]] in tents and the 10th regiment had moved <br/>
back on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] five miles with all their teams and baggage<br/>
The were in the snow several inches deep. The brethren travelled <br/>
several miles with the army. The men were so weak and cold <br/>
they would wrap up in their coats and lie down in the snow to rest <br/>
almost every mile.</p>

<p>We could not tell what the intentions of the officers <br/>
were. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] was of an opinion that Col Alexanders <br/>
intention was to come nearer our camp so that his men might desert <br/>
Col. [[Robert Taylor Burton|Robert Burton]] said that it was 80 miles from Alexander's <br/>
command to the mouth of [[Echo Canyon, Summit County, Utah Territory|Echo Kanyon]]. President Yound said ""here <br/>
are the officers around me and I will call a council of war. He then <br/>
said:</p>

<p>""I think it is best for General Wells to call in all his forces to <br/>
Echo Kanyon and there rest and not ride his horses to death unnecessarily</p>",
42829.0,248,,"<p>but let the enemy alone now and they will soon use themselves up. Keep <br/>
a few to watch their movements and let them work and they will <br/>
soon all be used up.</p>

<p>Dr [[George Washington Hickman|Hickman]] was with the 5th regiment and <br/>
Allen and his companions with the 10th regiment. [[Heber Parley Kimball|Heber <strike>C.</strike> Kimball<br/>
Jr]] sent Col [[Edmund Brooke Alexander|Alexander]] a doz onions and the Col said that if he <br/>
had anything that Heber wanted he would send it to him. He <br/>
asked Beaty why he tryed to stampede their animals and burn <br/>
the grass. He said ""we burn the grass to get a better crop next <br/>
year.</p>

<p>On this day the 21st some 700 or 800 head of cattle were drove <br/>
into the city taken from the U.S. Army. They were accompanied <br/>
by some teamsters and soldiers who looked poor and hungry.</p>

<p>President [[Brigham Young|Youngs]] Veiws of the Way to Conquer the Saints</p>

<p>In conversation on the 24th upon the events of the time President <br/>
Young said he was satisfied that we could live in this [[Great Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Valley]] and <br/>
raise crops and keep our enemies out. It is not in their power to <br/>
overthrow us. By the help of God we can remain here and they cannot <br/>
conquer us. I have reflected this over in my mind to see what <br/>
way I could conquer this people if I was there; and I cannot see but one <br/>
way and that way they will not attempt to take. The United States <br/>
have spent three millions of dollars this season to fit out an army to destroy <br/>
us and it has done us no harm. But if I was going to attempt <br/>
to destroy this people I should have let them have their Post Office made <br/>
one million dollars of appropriation given them all they asked for then spent <br/>
another million in carrying in Gentiles and merchandize and kept this up <br/>
yearly until I had filled the country with Gentiles but the Lord would <br/>
not let them do this. I should know I could not conquer them <br/>
by force and they will find it out</p>

<p>President Young got a letter to-day from Gen [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] <br/>
who said the enemy have returned back on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Ham's Fork]] some 15 miles</p>",
42829.0,249,,"<p>On the 25th Elders [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] arrived from the <br/>
head quarters of the army and met in council with us. President [[Brigham Young|Young]] upon <br/>
the subject of the war said I mean to send word to the United States that if they <br/>
have sent troops here the cattle which we have taken I will give them credit for upon <br/>
compound interest but I do not know that they have sent any. They have not <br/>
notified me officially and I have not right to know anything about it but shall <br/>
treat them as a mob</p>

<p>On the 26th Brother [[Peter Wilson Conover|Peter ^W^ Conover]] and [[Oliver Smith|Oliver Smith]] arrived and <br/>
called upon President Young with news from our [[Carson Valley, Utah Territory|Carson Valley]] company <br/>
The Carson Valley Saints and those from [[California|California]] and [[Oregon Territory|Oregon]] were on their <br/>
way to this [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|City]]. They had 160 fighting men with 2700 <u>lbs</u> of <br/>
ammunition belonging to the Church with a great deal of private property<br/>
and a large amount of arms. All the Saints were coming from Carson <br/>
Valley. They left only 2 boxes of caps and 1 <u>lb</u> of powder in all Carson <br/>
Valley. The people sold all their arms and ammunition to the brethren <br/>
for their places</p>

<p>President Young received a letter from General [[George Davis Grant|Grant]]. The U. S. <br/>
army were still on [[Hams Fork, Utah Territory|Hams Fork]] and had not decided which route they would <br/>
take. Our brethren had got the chief waggon master in custody</p>

<p>The Presidency and Twelve were in conversation all the <br/>
forenoon at his [[President|office]] on the subject of the war. President Young said <br/>
that the United States Government were loosing their national greatness, <br/>
and wisdom was departing from them. We need not ^have^ as much <strike>need</strike><br/>
<strike>to</strike> fear of them as we should of an army of grasshoppers. If they take <br/>
away our charter from us and divide our territory it will be unconstitutional <br/>
as everything is which they do against us. I told brother [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]]<br/>
that if they took away our Charter to come immediately home as soon <br/>
as he could and we would organize our State Government and <br/>
fall back upon our original boundaries. Our East boundary should <br/>
be as far as [[Laramie, unorganized U.S. Territory|Laramie]] and our West boundary the summit of the <br/>
[[Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, United States|Siere Nevada]] and run to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific Ocean]] and we would <br/>
defend it. The United States may do as they please. We will</p>",
42829.0,250,,"<p>do as the Lord wants us.</p>

<p>One young officer of the army said that old Jesus Christ <br/>
could not keep him out of[[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory| Salt Lake City]] but they will find out who rules on <br/>
earth and in the heavens. Another officer said the United States <br/>
would wipe us out another year. Should they send an army of 20,000 men <br/>
it would take more than 20 miles for their army and train to move<br/>
at all and the more there is of them the worse off they will be.</p>

<p>Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] said will not the army go into <br/>
[[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarter]] and entrench themselves and remain until they get help <br/>
from the States? President [[Brigham Young|Young]] said if an army comes to help <br/>
them in the Spring we will use <strike>them</strike> up this army first and then we will<br/>
us up the other before they get to the South Pass. In the Spring we <br/>
must ask [[Edmund Brooke Alexander|Alexander]] what he intends to do inform him that he must <br/>
not stay there until he gets reinforcements in the Spring and if they will not <br/>
leave in the Spring we will use them up as best we can in ten days. We <br/>
can put two thousand men around them who <strike>c</strike>would soon use them <br/>
up. I do not believe they will have 500 fighting men in the <br/>
Spring. They are in a very critical situation. I think it is <br/>
better to let them alone this Winter. They will die many of them <br/>
and others desert and many be weakened with the scurvey and in the <br/>
Spring we will wipe them out if necesary if they dont go away. <br/>
We do all our business in the name of Israel's God and they in <br/>
their own way. The whole matter can be sumed up in these <br/>
few words. We are here at home by our own fireseide while they are <br/>
a great way from home. I intend to send those teamsters to the <br/>
South where they cannot get back to the army.</p>

<p>By express on the 20th we learned that <br/>
the enemy had not moved for several days but were writing <br/>
for Col [[Albert Sidney Johnston|Johnson]] to come up with four companies of cavalry and <br/>
two companies of infantry. This however was but from report <br/>
and not authority</p>

<p>It was decided in Council that General [[Daniel Hanmer Wells|Wells]] John Taylor</p>",

but four of us among the living.</p>

<p>My life commenced with the spring. I was born in the North part of the <br/>
town of Farmington, now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], March 1<sup><u>st</u></sup> 1807. Tho occupation of my Father was a miller from his youth up<br/>
which occupation I followed untill AD 1831. Variant <s>&amp;</s>and divers are the lives &amp; fortunes of men in evry age of the<br/>
world, while the path of some are strewed with flowers &amp; ease from the cradle to the grave, with naught to disturd their<br/>
peace, others Apparrently are marked victims, of variated misfortunes, accident &amp; dangers, the last named class is<br/>
the one in whose ranks I have stood through my infancy, childhood, youth &amp; manhood nearly to the present time<br/>
so much so that it has seemed at times as though some invisible power or fate was watching my footsteps in order<br/>
to find some opportunity to take my life from the earth, But I can ownly attribut the continuation of my life on earth to the<br/>
present time to a merciful Providence whose hand has ben stretched out &amp; rescued me from death in the midst of the<br/>
many dangers &amp; hair bredths escapes which I have passed through in life, some of which I will here mention. When three years<br/>
of age, I fell into a caldron of scalding water, was instantly caught out, <s>&amp;</s>and so badly scalded, that it was <strike>nine</strike> nine months<br/>
before the[y] considerd me out of danger <strike>of the effects of the accident.</strike> My fifth &amp; sixth years was interwoven with many acci-<br/>
dents. On a certain day in company with my elder Brothers I entered the Barn &amp; chose the top of a hay mow for a place<br/>
of diversion. We had not been there long before I fell from the great beam upon my face upon the bear floor, which ended<br/>
our sport for that day at least, however I shortly recoverd from the fall &amp; a few weeks afterwords was again to play<br/>
in the chamber of my Fathers House on Sunday with my Brothers Azmon &amp; Thompson, and father reproved us for so<br/>
doing, but we were so busy we could not spend time to obey our fathers ^command^ <strike>advise</strike>, And whether we disturded him or<br/>
whether he thought of [[Solomon (OT)|Solomons]] advise I know not but at all events he spared not the rod of correction, and began<br/>
to flog us. we started to go below, &amp; as we came to the stairs I was behind &amp; hence the blows fell on me and while making<br/>
an effort to get before my brothers I made a misstep &amp; fell to the bottom of the stairs &amp; broke one of my arms in the fall, <br/>
so much for disobediance. It was not long before I recoverd from this misfortune &amp; was about the streets again<br/>
It was but a short time before I narrowly escaped with my life. My father owned a stock of horned cattle</p>",
42828.0,12,,"<p>And among them was one cow which I called mine, one evening I accompanied my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] to the barn, <br/>
to fodder them. It being in the fall of the year we were feeding out pumpkins and among our stock<br/>
Father had a large surley Bull, &amp; while distributing the pum<s>k</s>pkins my cow got one &amp; the Bull another, soon<br/>
the Bull came &amp; got the one my cow had. I then went &amp; got the one the Bull left, to give my cow No sooner<br/>
had I got it in my arms, than the Bull left his &amp; came after me, I ran down a hill with all my might &amp; <br/>
the Bull at my heels my Father seeing my danger told me to throw down the pum^p^kin but feeling anxious<br/>
to see that my cow should have her right I still held on. Bu<s>ll</s>t while the Bull was approaching me with<br/>
the fierceness of a tiger I made a miss step fell flat upon the ground, the pumpkin rolled out of my arms<br/>
the Bull leaped over me run his horns into the pumpkin &amp; tore it to peaces &amp; probably would have<br/>
done the same by me had I not have fallen which escape like many others I attribute to the mercy &amp; goodness<br/>
of GOD. It was during the same year that I was again under the necessary of employing a physician<br/>
while paying a visit at my Uncle [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1773|Eldad Woodruff]] I was standing in a porch with one arm around a<br/>
pillar leaning over the railing my arm sliped off the pillar &amp; I fell several feet across some timber &amp;<br/>
broke my other arm. One would naturly suppose by this time that I should begin to grow caucious<br/>
in my procedings. But not many months rolled around defore I was called to endure still heavier<br/>
fate. My father owned a lumber sawmill in addition to his flowering mill, and one morning in<br/>
company with several other boys I went into the saw mill &amp; got onto the head Block of the carriage<br/>
to ride not anticipating any danger but before I was awere of it my leg was caught between the<br/>
head block &amp; fender post &amp; broaken short into, I was taken to the house &amp; lay nine hours before my bones<br/>
wer replased which time was spent amid severe pain, but being young my bones soon nit together<br/>
&amp; in few weeks I was again upon my feet as usual attending to the sport <strike>&amp;</strike> of my youth. <br/>
During my confinement with this lameness, my Brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] <strike>was</strike> was my companion going<br/>
through a course of the tipus fever. Thus one scene of accident after another followed me through<br/>
my youth from <s>y</s>month to month &amp; year to year. I had occasion one dark evening to cross my fathers<br/>
meadow while doing so I run against an ox that was feeding the ox not knowing what it was concluded<br/>
to defend himself with his heels, he kicked me in the bowels but I being so near him I was rather more frightened<br/>
than hurt. Again my uncle had a load of hay to get in and for the want of help proposed for me to load<br/>
it. Although I was young I agreed to make the trial, &amp; with his assistance I thought it loaded vary well but<br/>
befor he reached the barn he drove over a large stone &amp; turned most of the hay over I fell onto the ground<br/>
&amp; the load top of me. But an exertion was made &amp; the hay removed from me as soon as possible &amp; I<br/>
once more breathed a free element. While 8 years of age I accompanied my father with several others<br/>
in a one horse waggon about three miles from home to attend to some work, while on the way the horses decame<br/>
frightend ran dow a hill &amp; turned the waggon over with us in it But again while in danger I was saved<br/>
by the hand of providence none of us was injured. While in the days of my youth I cl<strike>u</strike>imb^ed^ an elm tree<br/>
to procure some bark &amp; while about fifteen feet from the ground the limb deing dry upon which<br/>
I stood it broke &amp; I fell to the ground upon my bacck<s>s</s> which apparrently beat the breath out of<br/>
my body A cousin that was with me ran to the house &amp; told my parents that I was dead, but <br/>
before my freinds got to me I had revived rose upon my feet &amp; met them on the way<br/>
At Twelve years of Age I was drowned in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington River]] &amp; sunk in 30 feet<br/>
of water and was almost mirac<s>l</s>ulously saved by a young man named [[John Bacon|Bacon]] I suffered<br/>
much in being restored to life. At Thirteen years of age while passing through [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]</p>",
42828.0,13,,"<p>meadows in the debth of winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an exceding<br/>
blustering day I became so chilled and overcome with the cold that I could not travel I cra<s>l</s>wled<br/>
into the hallow of a large Apple tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into it hastened to me<br/>
realizing more fully than I did the danger I was in. when he arived at the spot I had fallen asleep,<br/>
&amp; was nearly insensible he had much difficulty in arousing me to a sens of my situation. he procu-<br/>
red means to convey me to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] House and through a kind Providence my life was again pres[er]ved.</p>

<p>At Fourteen years of Age I split my left instep open with an Ax which went nearly through my foot<br/>
it was about nine months getting well. I suffered much with it.</p>

<p>At Fifteen years of age I was bit in the hand with a mad dog in the last stage of the hydrophobia<br/>
but he ownly dented my hand with his Teeth but did not draw blood &amp; I was again preserved through<br/>
the [[mercy of God|mercy of God]] from an awful death</p>

<p>At the age of seventeen I met with an accident which caused me much suffering &amp; came near<br/>
Ending my life I was riding very ill tempered horse whose temper &amp; practices I was igno-<br/>
rant of and while going down a vary steep rocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground<br/>
instantly leaped from the road &amp; ran down the steepest part of the Hill amid the thickest of the rocks at<br/>
full speed and he commenced kicking up at the same time &amp; was about landing me over his head am[o]ng<br/>
the rocks but I lodged on the top of his head &amp; grasp one hand hold of each ear as with a death<br/>
grasp, expecting evry moment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks, while in this position seting<br/>
Astride his neck with no bridle to guide him but his ears, he plunged down the hill among the rocks<br/>
with all fury untill he struck a rock near breast high, which dashed him to the earth. I went over<br/>
his head about one rod and struck the ground square upon my feet being the ownly thing that saved<br/>
my life: for had I sruck the ground on any other part of my body it must have killed me instatly.<br/>
as it was my bones crushed from under me as though they were reeds. I broke <strike>two</strike>one ^one^ of my legs<br/>
<strike>&amp; one</strike> twice in two &amp; put out both of my ancles in a shocking manner. And the horse came nigh<br/>
rolling over me afterwards in his struggles. An [[Titus Woodruff|Uncle]] of mine saw me fall &amp; hastened to my<br/>
relief, &amp; got assistance &amp; carried me to his house in an arm chair. I lay from 2 oclok in the Afternoon<br/>
till 10 at night without aids then my Father arived bringing with him Dr. [[Dr. Swift|Swift]] of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]<br/>
who set my bones boxed up my limbs &amp; carryed me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my Fathers<br/>
house my sufferings were vary great; yet I had good attendance &amp; in 8 weeks was outdoors<br/>
upon my crutches, &amp; soon was well again.</p>

<p>In A.D. 1827 while I was tending a flouring mill for Aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Wheeler]] in [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] Ct. I was<br/>
standing upon one of the wheels clearing the ice off A man hoisted the gate &amp; let a full head of water<br/>
upon the wheel which instantly started as the water struck it at the same instant my feet sliped into the wheel<br/>
wheel. I immediately plunged head foremost over the rim of the wheel into about 3 feet of water &amp; my weight drew<br/>
my legs out of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft &amp; crushed to death</p>

<p>In AD 1831 while having charge of the flouring Mill at [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsvill]] Ct. I was standing inside<br/>
of a Breast wheel 20 feet in diameter upon one of the Arms near the top clearing the ice out of it when<br/>
A full head of water was let onto it it immediately started I droped my ax and leaped to the bottom<br/>
of the wheel by the shaft &amp; arms near 20 feet. As I struck the bottom of the wheel I was rolled<br/>
out against a ragged stone wall with ownly two feet clearance between it &amp; ^the^ wheel the wheel caught<br/>
me and rolled me out into the water below whare I found myself without any broaken bones<br/>
but with some bruises and much fright</p>",
42828.0,14,1846-10-15,"<p>In <time datetime=""1833-12"">Dec A.D. 1833</time>. The day that I was Baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day<br/>
Saints. One of my horses newly calked kicked my hat off my head and had he struck<br/>
two inches lower would probably have killed me instantly. In Ten minutes after while driving the same<br/>
horses down a hill on a sled with loose bottom boards without a box the boards slip'd forward under the roll<br/>
caught the ground turned endways &amp; fell on the horses backs throwing me between them under the sled<br/>
they run to the bottom of the hill draging me by the lines head foremost with the sled top of me abo[u]t<br/>
Twenty rods over a vary smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangers<br/>
In <time datetime=""1834"">1834</time> while travelling in [[Zion|Zions Camp]] to [[Missouri|Missouri]] A rifle was accidentally discharged &amp; the<br/>
ball passed through Three tents with a dozen men in each &amp; lodged in a waggon Axletree without injury<br/>
to any one it passed within a few inches of my breast &amp; many others escaped quite as narrow as myself<br/>
a few months after a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing at my breast within<br/>
a few feet of me h[e]avily loaded with buck shot but it missed fire &amp; my life was again preserved<br/>
In <time datetime=""1839-04"">April 1839</time> while in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] Ill. I was riding upon the run<strike>n</strike>ing part of a waggon without<br/>
any box I was siting on the foreward Axletree and the boult came out fastning the four wheels togeth<br/>
this left the hind wheels, &amp; my weight on the forward boulster &amp; tongue turned the coupling pole<br/>
clear over onto the horses backs turned the stakes upside down &amp; shot me up fast between the bolster &amp;<br/>
tongue but in such a manner that my head and shoulders draged on the ground my horses took <br/>
fright &amp; run out onto an open praire and they draged me in this position for about half of a <br/>
mile when I managed to guide them so as to run them into the corner of a high worm fence<br/>
whare we landed in a pile together I was considerably bru<strike>s</strike>ised but escaped without any broaken<br/>
bones and after one days rest was enabled to attend to my labour again.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",10/15/1846
42828.0,14,,""">15<sup>th</sup> day of October 1846</time> while with the [[Camp of Israel|Camp of Israel]] building up [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]]<br/>
on the west side of [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] then Indian Country, I passed through one of the most painful<br/>
&amp; serious misfortunes of any of my lif<s>if</s>e.  I took my Ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the Bluffs to cut<br/>
some shingle timber to cover my cabins. I was accompanied by two other men and while falling the third<br/>
tree I steped back of it some 8 feet whare I thought I was entirely out of Danger but when the tree<br/>
fell their was a <strike>ko</strike>crook in the tree which struck a knowl and shot and ways back of the stump and <br/>
bounded &amp; the but of the tree struck me in the breast &amp; knocked me several feet in the air against<br/>
a standing Oak and the falling tree followed me in its bound &amp; caught me against the standing tree and<br/>
I came down between the two trees one falling &amp; the other standing but before reaching the ground I was<br/>
cleared from between them &amp; struct upon my feet it badly bruised my ^left^ thigh the whole length of it<br/>
&amp; my hip. Also my left arm It also broke my breast bone into &amp; 3 ribs on my left side it also bruised my<br/>
lungs vitals &amp; left side in a shocking manner. After the accident I sat upon a log untill Mr [[John Garrison|John Garrison]]<br/>
went a quarter of a mile &amp; got my horse, notwithstanding <strike>w</strike>I was so badly hurt I had to mount my hourse<br/>
&amp; ride two &amp; a half miles over an exceding rough road &amp; had to dismount twice in consequence of mirey<br/>
places my breast &amp; vitals was so badly torn to peaces that each step of the horse went through me like an<br/>
arrow I continued on hors<strike>e</strike>back untill I arived at [[Turkey Creek, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turkey Creek]] on the North Side of Winter quarters<br/>
I then became exhausted &amp; was taken off &amp; carried in a chair to my house I was met in <strike>a</strike> th<s>e</s>e street<br/>
by Presidents [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] ^&amp; others^ who assisted in carrying me to my waggon<br/>
&amp; family before laying me upon my bed they [[laying on of hands|laid hands]] upon me &amp; rebuked my pain &amp; distress in</p>",
42828.0,15,,"<p>the name of the Lord &amp; said I should live and not die I was then laid upon my bed in my waggon<br/>
as my cabbin was not done, &amp; as the Apostles prophesied upon my head so it came to pass I did live<br/>
&amp; not die I employed no physician on this occasion but was [[priesthood blessing|administered]] to by the [[Elders of Israel|Elders of Israel]] and nursed<br/>
by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]. I lay upon my bed unabled to move untill my breast bone began to knit together which commenced on the <br/>
9<sup><u>th</u></sup> day I began to walk about in 20 days and in 30 days from the time I was hurt I again commenced hard labour<br/>
And it has always appeared mir<strike>r</strike>aculous to me that with all the injuries &amp; broaken bones that I have had that<br/>
I now have not a lame limb about, <strike>but</strike> me, but have been enabled ever since to endure the hardest man-<br/>
uel labour, exposures, hardship &amp; Journ<s>e</s>ies, have even walked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles in<br/>
a day, however if I overlabour or take a severe cold I feel it more sensibly in my breast &amp; left side than<br/>
I did before my last injury. Thus I have occupied considerable space in refering to those peculiar circumstances<br/>
which have attended me during life and to sum the matter up it stands about thus, I have broaken both<br/>
legs (one twice in two) both Arms, both Ancles, my breast bone &amp; three ribs, have been drowned, froze, &amp; scalded,<br/>
have been in two water<s>h</s>wheels while turning under a full head of water &amp; have passed through a score of other<br/>
hair breadths esscape yet the mercies of God have been over me, &amp; my life has thus far been preserved on<br/>
the Earth For which blessing I feel to render the gratitude of my heart with thanksgiving to my [[Heavenly Father|Heavenly <br/>
Father]] praying that the remainder of my days may be spent in his service &amp; the building up of his Kingdom</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>My experience and Reflections upon religious subjects previous to hearing &amp; embracing the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness]] of the<br/>
[[everlasting gospel|everlasting gospel]] as tought &amp; practiced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints</p>

<p>At an early age my mind from time to time began to be exercised upon religious subjects<br/>
but I never made a profession of religion untill AD 1830 being 23 years of age. I did not then <br/>
Join any church for the reason that I could not find any body of People, denomination, or church<br/>
who had for their foundation, doctrines, tenets, faith, &amp; practices: that gospel, faith, principles, practices<br/>
ordinances, gifts and foundation which the Ancient Apostles Prophets &amp; Saints Taught, enjoyed and<br/>
held forth as the gospel of Jesus Christ with the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] and its attendant gifts and graces. And whenever<br/>
I conversed with ministers of the various denominations or se<strike>x</strike>cts they would universally tell me that prophets,<br/>
Apostles, Revelations, [[healing the sick|Healing the sick]] &amp;c were given to esstablish Jesus Christ &amp; his doctrin &amp; have ever since been<br/>
done away and no longer needed in the church &amp; [[kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]]. This Argument I could not, nor<strike>,</strike> never<br/>
did believe. But I did believe that Revelation, the gifts, graces, &amp; faith once deliverd to the saints which they<br/>
have enjoyed in all former Ages when God has ha<strike>s</strike>d an acknowledged people on Earth has been done<br/>
away ownly through the disobedience and unbelief of the children of man I believed evry gift Office and<br/>
blessing just as necessary to constitute a true church of Christ and Kingdom of God in our day &amp; gener-<br/>
ation as in any age of the world. This principle &amp; belief was firmly rivited upon my mind from two<br/>
causes, first from the perusal of the bible whare I found cause and effect alike in all past ages and the same<br/>
promised in all generations to come. At the same time I could not find any change of the gospel or the [[plan of salvation|plan<br/>
of salvation]] in the days of Christ &amp; the Apostles or that their would be any change in the ordinances of the<br/>
gospel or plan of saving men in the last days. I learned from the scriptures that many of the Ancient<br/>
Prophets, &amp; Christ and the Apostles, did foresee by Inspiration &amp; Revelation and did prophesy that the Gentile<br/>
Nations as the Jews had done <strike>would</strike> would Apostatize &amp; turn away from the true faith and church and</p>",
42828.0,16,,"<p>[[kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] that thare would be a [[falling away|falling away]] from Apostolic faith Doctrins and ordinances<br/>
and that other systems would arise in its stead, and when these fals systems had arived at their<br/>
fullness than would ""the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom which should become an Everlasting Kingdom<br/>
to whose dominion should be no end."" 'Then should this gospel of the Kingdom be preached in all<br/>
the world as a witness unto all Nations before the End should come"" Then should the church come<br/>
up out of the wilderness and be esstablished upon the foundation of the Ancient Apostles &amp; Prophets<br/>
Christ Jesus being the [[chief cornerstone|chief corner stone]]. Also that the same gospel and Kingdom of God with<br/>
all its attendant blessings &amp; promises that was taken from the Jews (who had fallen through unbelief)<br/>
and given to the gentiles who brought forth the fruits of that Kingdom for a season but when they<br/>
fell away in like manners through the same example of unbelief Then the gospel &amp; Kingdom of God<br/>
will be taken out of the hands of the Gentiles as Nations and again be restored to the Jews with all the<br/>
[[House of Israel|House of Israel]] And that when this gospel &amp; Kingdom was restored to the Jews it would possess<br/>
all the powers gifts blessing &amp; ordances which it did possess when it was taken from them.</p>

<p>These things I did learn from the perusal of the scriptures which made a lasting impression upon my<br/>
mind. Another cause for these principles being planted in my mind was I was taught in the <br/>
days of my youth by an aged man by the name of [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]] who lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|S<s>y</s>imsbury]] C.t.<br/>
He was called by many a Prophet and many of his prophesies have since come to pass to my<br/>
certain knowledge. through fasting, prayer, &amp; the [[laying on of hands|laying on of hands]] in the name of Jesus Christ the<br/>
sick were healed, and devils were cast out under his A<strike>c</strike>dministration, even his own son who had<br/>
become a raving maniac after praying &amp; fasting for <u>nine</u> days in his behalf He arose from his bed on<br/>
the ninth day &amp; rebuked the ^evil spirit^ <strike>devil</strike> &amp; commanded the devil to come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ<br/>
and it instantly obeyed him &amp; he was made whole from that hour. This man instilled those principles<br/>
into my mind also into the mind of my Elder Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon Woodruff]] ^and Many others^. He did not believe the church<br/>
&amp; Kingdom of God in its organized form was among man on the Earth. He considerd that he had no<br/>
authority to administer in any of the ord<strike>a</strike>inances of the Gospel and knew of No man that had, but<br/>
believed it his privilege or the privilege of any man who had faith in God to fast and pray for the<br/>
sick by the laying on off hands, and to pray for light knowledge truth visions &amp; revelations. He told me<br/>
the day was nigh<s>t</s> when the Lord would again esstablish his church and Kingdom on the Earth with<br/>
all the gifts &amp; graces that were manifest in the days of the Savior. He said it would commence upon the<br/>
Earth before he died but <strike>it</strike>he would not live to enjoy &amp; partake of its blessings but said that<br/>
I should &amp; that I should become a conspicuous actor in that Kingdom. The last time that<br/>
I ever saw him He related to me the following visi<s>n</s>on which he had in his field in open day<br/>
""He said I was carried away in a vision &amp; found myself standing in the midst of a vast<br/>
orchard of fruit trees I became hungry &amp; I wandered through the vast forest of fruit trees<br/>
searching for Fruit to eat but I found n<strike>ot</strike>one &amp; while I stood gazeing in amazement at not<br/>
finding any fruit amid so many trees they began to fall prostrate around me as though they were<br/>
torn up by a whirlwind &amp; they continued to fall untill there was not a tree standing in the whole forest<br/>
I immediately saw young shoots spring up from the roots which formed themselves into young &amp;<br/>
beautiful trees and they immediately budded, blossomed &amp; bore fruit which ripened to maturity which<br/>
was the most beautiful <s>of</s> ^to look upon^ of any thing my eyes had ever beheld and I stretched forth my hand &amp; plucked<br/>
some of the fruit, &amp; I gazed upon it with delight, and as I was about to eat of it the vision closed<br/>
&amp; I did not eat of it at all. I found myself in my field at the close of the vision and I bowed down</p>",
42828.0,17,,"<p>Before the Lord and I called upon his Holy name and asked him to make known unto me the meaming of the <br/>
vision. And the [[voice of the Lord|voice of the Lord]] came unto me saying, Son of man thou hast saught diligently to know<br/>
the truth concerning my Church &amp; kingdom among man, this is to show you that my Church is not organized<br/>
upon the face of the earth in the generation in which you live, neither is the true fruit of the [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]] made<br/>
manifest among the people; but in the days of your children even the rising generation shall the Church &amp; kingdom<br/>
of God be made manifest, revealed and esstablished upon the Earth among the children of men, then shall the<br/>
true fruit of the vine &amp; the gospel of Christ be given unto all those who will receive it &amp; obey the ordinances of the<br/>
Gospel of Salvation. You will live to be<strike>a</strike> made acquainted with it but will not live to partake of it before you depart this<br/>
life, but you will be blessed of the Lord after death because you have followed the dictation of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy<br/>
spirit]] while in life."" when he had finished relating the vision He said to me I am satisfyed that you will<br/>
stand in that Kingdom &amp; assist in building it up, but I shall die before I partake of its ordinances, he then<br/>
blessed me in the name of the Lord &amp; bid me farewell, it being the Last time that I ever saw him. This was in<br/>
1828, and he was vary aged. In <time datetime=""1833-12"">Dec in 1833</time> [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zera Pulsipher]] came to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] Oswego County New York<br/>
whare I was then living He was holding the office of an Elder &amp; he preached the gospel to us in that place<br/>
and I went forth &amp; was Baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and almost<br/>
the first person I thought off was Father [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]] and on my arival in [[Missouri|Missouri]] <s>n</s>as a member<br/>
of [[Zion|Zion Camp]], I wrote a long letter to him &amp; other friends setting forth the <strike>coming</strike> visitation of<br/>
the [[Moroni (BofM)|Angel]] of God, the coming forth of the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]], the esstablishment of the Church<br/>
of Christ &amp; Kingdom of God, with the priesthood &amp; all its attendant Blessings and all things<br/>
which I could think of connected with the esstablishment of the Church in its infancy. The<br/>
old Gentleman received the Letter with a great deal of satisfaction &amp; had it read over<br/>
many times to him, &amp; handled it (as he did the fruit in his vision) &amp; rejoiced before the Lord<br/>
but he so<s>n</s>on died &amp; had not an opportunity of receiving the ordinances from under the hands of an<br/>
Elder in the Church, but the first opportunity which I had I was baptized for him in the [[baptismal font|Font]] at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]].<br/>
One of the most remarkable events of Father Masons Life was he said he was called to Fast forty<br/>
days, and he commenced to fast &amp; pray with a determination to Fast the Forty days, but he fasted<br/>
twenty seven days without taking any nourishment or food, but on the twenty seventh day the Lord<br/>
told him to arise &amp; eat for he had excepted his sacrafize as he did [[Abraham (OT)|Abrahams]]. The Lord told him<br/>
to kill a Lamb &amp; cook &amp; eat of it &amp; he did so &amp; his apetite came to him &amp; he partook of a harty<br/>
meal without any injury to him &amp; the next day he walked 10 miles. He considered that He fasted<br/>
the 40 days as Much as Abram offered up his son [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] He felt that he could have fasted the<br/>
40 days as well as the 27. There was a reasonableness in the teachings of this man which so<br/>
firmly agreed with the prophesies &amp; teachings of the Ancient Prophets &amp; Christ and the Apos-<br/>
tles that I firmly believed them with all my heart, And I gave myself to the reading of<br/>
the scriptures &amp; Earnest prayer before God day &amp; night as far as I had an oppertunity<br/>
for years before I herd the preaching of the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness of the Gospel]] by a Latter Day Saint. I<br/>
have plead with the Lord many hours, in the forest, among the rocks, in the fields, in the Mill &amp;<br/>
at midnight that He would give unto me light, truth, &amp; the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]] to lead me in the way<br/>
of salvation And my Prayers were answered untill many things were revealed unto me &amp; my<br/>
mind was opened to the truth so much so that I was fully satisfied that I should live to see the true<br/>
Church of Christ esstablished upon the Earth &amp; a people raised up who would do the [[will of God|will of God]] &amp; <br/>
keep his commandments &amp; who would bring forth the true fruit of that Kingdom</p>",

<p>The various places in which I resided. My busines and manner of Life and experience up to<br/>
the time of my being baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</p>

<p>I spent my early life in the north part of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] Hartford County Ct<br/>
which was the plase of my birth, as soon as I was old enough to travel two miles to school (which was<br/>
the distance to our district school house) I attended summer &amp; winter with my two Elder Brothers<br/>
untill I was ten years of age, at which time My [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] sold out his Property consisting of a saw<br/>
mill, Flouring Mill, Carding Machine, &amp; a large Farm &amp; a stock of cattle this was done in order to pay<br/>
his debts as he had become much involved by loaning money &amp; undersigning men at the bank<br/>
My early sports consisted chiefly of angling for the spotted trout which abounded in the stream<br/>
which fed my Fathers Mill Pond My Brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] &amp; myself were considered the most<br/>
successful Fisherman of any persons who visited the Brook. During the winter season we would set box<br/>
traps for gray Rabits &amp; we caught a good many. My mind was rather more taken up upon these subjects<br/>
in my boyhood than it was in learning my books at school, for in those days Parents did not feel the<br/>
importance of looking after the Education of their children any more than merely to send them to school<br/>
considering that the Education of their children was wholey depending upon the school master.</p>

<p>when I was 8 years of age there was a revival of religion in our Neighborhood mostly conducted by the Baptist<br/>
denomination. Elder Brooker also Elder Quishman of [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartfort <strike>County</strike>]] Coun<s>ty</s>necticut preached at my Fathers House<br/>
and baptized my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step Mother<s>s</s>]] &amp; several other relatives, both of my brothers made ^a^ profession of religion<br/>
I attended their meetings, &amp; prayed with the young People &amp; tried to get religion but it soon wore off from my<br/>
mind as it did from the mind of Brother Thompson But Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] was very faithful to his prayers<br/>
his bible &amp; his God through all the days of his youth &amp; manhood up to the time of his embracing the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness]]<br/>
of the [[everlasting gospel|everlasting gospel]]. My Father having sold out his property in [[Northington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Northington]] now called Avon moved<br/>
with his Family to Farmington and Engaged to attend the Farmington Flouring Mill built upon [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington<br/>
River]] &amp; owned by a company by the name of Cowles Deming &amp; Camp, He took possession of those mills<br/>
in 1818 &amp; He continued in charge of them nearly all the time up to 1846 I remained with my Father<br/>
attending school in the Town of Farmington untill I was 14 years. The <time datetime=""",05/01/1821
42828.0,18,,""">1<sup><u>st</u></sup> of May 1821</time> I went to live<br/>
with Col [[George Cowles|George Cowles]] &amp; remained with him two years attending school during the winter season &amp; worked<br/>
upon his Farm through the summer. while with him during the year <time datetime=""1822"">1822</time> I passed through another great<br/>
revival of religion among the people I like the rest of my young companions attended enquiring meetings<br/>
&amp; prayer meetings among the Pr<strike>y</strike>esb<strike>e</strike>ytarians they being the ownly religious society in the town I also attended their<br/>
Sundy school I laboured &amp; prayed &amp; tried to get religion, but there was sumthing in there manner of teaching<br/>
&amp; exhorting us to give our hearts to God without telling us what to do or pointing out the way so that we could<br/>
understand it or comprehend it that with me it created darkness &amp; not light, misery &amp; not happiness &amp; ther<br/>
teachings did not seem to enlighted my mind or do me Good although I laboured hard to obtain benefit from <br/>
it. many young people were making profession of religion but I did not wish to make a mock of those<br/>
things or profess to be converted &amp; have religion unless I could be made sensible that I had received light<br/>
&amp; truth &amp; sumthing tangible that would be of benefit to me I did pray &amp; labor hard to obtain religion<br/>
but did not feel that I obtained any special light truth or benefit in trying to follow the teachings given me at that time</p>",
42828.0,19,,"<p>I remained with Mr. [[George Cowles|Cowles]] untill <time datetime=""1823-06"">June 1823</time> a little over two years I then returned home &amp; spent the season<br/>
with my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] &amp; worked in the Mill and in the fall My Father made an arangement with Mr.<br/>
[[Andrew Mills|Andrew Mills]] of [[West Hartford, Hartford County, Connecticut|West Hartford]] Ct for me to board with him &amp; do chores for my board &amp; go to school<br/>
According to agreement I soon became a member of Mr. Mills Family &amp; for several weeks I passed<br/>
through a regular course of that distressing d<strike>e</strike>isease called Home sickness I suffered immensly I had never<br/>
before lived at any place whare I had not been free &amp; social. But Mr Mills was a proud Auste[r]e man<br/>
&amp; I had no conversation with him ownly in being asked &amp; answering a question &amp; for about 2 weeks<br/>
I did not eat drink or sleep but little but I soon began to go to school &amp; because acquainted with my<br/>
school mates &amp; my sickness left me &amp; has never yet returned and at the close of the school I returned<br/>
home to my Fathers house in the spring of <time datetime=""1824"">1824</time>. But soon my Father Made a contract with Mr<br/>
[[Horace Hillyear Judd|Horace Judd]] for me to go &amp; work one year with him. He was our nearest neighbor at our homested in [[Northington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Northington]]<br/>
and one of my school mates his [[Calvin Judd|Father]] having died &amp; left him in charge of a large Family of sisters<br/>
He being the ownly son. I commenced work with him but did not stay the year out during the for part<br/>
of winter I split my instep open with an ax which lamed me for abot nine months My Brother<br/>
[[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] took my place and worked my time out also one year for himself. I remained at<br/>
home untill the spring of <time datetime=""1825"">1825</time> when I started from home on horseback to go some 10 miles to engage to work<br/>
for a man a year upon a farm but before I arived there my horse run away with me &amp; flung me among<br/>
some Rocks &amp; broke one of my legs twice in two &amp; put out both Ancles in a shocking manner as recorded in<br/>
the Chapter of incidents. this confined me to the House near two months. the first time that I walked half a<br/>
mile I went to attend the funeral of two men one by the name of [[Noadiah Bird|Bird]] who was murdered by a crazy man named [[Alfred Rowe|Roe]] He<br/>
split open Birds Head with an ax and laid his brains bare &amp; cut his throat from ear to ear, and the other mans name<br/>
was [[E. Drayton Bodwell|Bodwell]] a promising young man who was shot de<strike>d</strike>ad the night after the murder by one of his companions under<br/>
the following circumstances word was given out to take Row either Dead or alive &amp; about 500 men went out into<br/>
the Mountains Hills vallies &amp; the whole country was guarded as the Murderer had hid himself up, they went out 3 or 4 in<br/>
company and Roe had a plad cloak on &amp; Mr Bodwell put on the same kind of a cloak to go out to guard through<br/>
the night, his uncle strongly urged him not to wear the cloak as it might endanger his life. but He thinking <br/>
there would be no danger wore it &amp; during the evening while approching another company a young man by the<br/>
name of Gager seeing a man <strike>by the name of Gager</strike> with a cloak on he thinking that it might be Roe<br/>
He hailed him with the countersign &amp; recieved no answer He then leveled his gun &amp; fired &amp; shot Bodwell<br/>
dead he spoke a few moments &amp; expired I saw the corpses of these men it was the first body which had ben<br/>
murdered that I had ever seen. Roe was finally taken &amp; tryed acquitted upon the plea of insanity but<br/>
put into the insane assylum Gager was tryed for manslaughter, but forfeited &amp; paid his bond rather than run the<br/>
risk of being found guilty. I remained at home with my Father untill April<s>l</s> 1826 at work in the mill I attended<br/>
school during the past winter being 18 years of age. In <time datetime=""1826-04"">April 1826</time> I went to live with widow [[Damaris Bogue Deming|Deming]] in<br/>
the east part of Northington, I staid with her and labored upon her farm for nine m<s>i</s>onths I then returned<br/>
home to my Fathers House and assisted him in his mills. I remained with him untill <time datetime=""1827-04"">April 1827</time> at which<br/>
time I left home &amp; went to live with My Fathers Sister Aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen Wheeler]] I took her Flouring Mill<br/>
and tended it upon shares in East [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] I never again returned to my Fathers House to live with him I<br/>
ownly called as a visitor I was always made welcome at my Fathers House by each member of it this was an<br/>
important period in my feelings to leave my Fathers roof to step forth upon the stage of life to act for myself<br/>
to be my own councellor &amp; form my own caracter in the open broad world filled my mind with serious reflection<br/>
as I wanded my way from my Fathers Roof it created in my mind an anxiety which was more paneful than Joyous</p>",
42828.0,20,,"<p>I was twenty years of age when I left my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] Family &amp; commenced business with aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Wheeler]] I<br/>
remained with her for three years which brought me to <time datetime=""1830"">1830</time>. I had the following reflections on leaving my<br/>
Fathers house. -[should I outlive my Parents how long will it be before I shall follow them to the grave and the places<br/>
which now know them will know them no more &amp; it will be said of them they have gone the way of all the Earth and<br/>
their children while filling their places are following them into the same Eternal world. I am now twenty years of <br/>
age &amp; leaving my Fathers house this is an important period &amp; step in my life &amp; in the life of Evry man for at this<br/>
age generally speaking evry man forms a character both for time and Eternity. The character principles &amp; sentiments<br/>
which are formed from the age of Eightteen to twenty five are generall so deeply planted in the heart that they<br/>
controll their future lives &amp; remain with them through life whether they be good or evil. and I felt to say how<br/>
cautious I ought to be how I pass this link in the chain of my existance I felt that I needed caution prudence<br/>
circumspection &amp; wisdom to guide my Footsteps as I step forth to act for myself. I reflected upon the days of<br/>
my youth which were gone &amp; the speed of time which had flown like an arrow to return no more forever, while<br/>
walk<strike>e</strike>ing in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in the same water neither can we spend twice the same time<br/>
then how ought we to prize the golden moments of time &amp; measure it out with our talents to the honor<br/>
&amp; glory of God &amp; for the salvation of our souls so that when the Lord comes he may recieve his own<br/>
with usury. In trying to comprehend the fleetness of time I asked myself the question whare is the old world<br/>
whare are the Prophets &amp; Apostles whare are the millions of the inhabitants of the Earth including my Father<br/>
&amp; whare are the days of my youth, gone, gone, all gone into the boundless ocean of Eternity whare<br/>
I shall soon find myself]-</p>

<p>During the 3 years which I spent with Aunt Wheeler I passed through quite a school of experiences<br/>
both temporal &amp; spiritual. The class of associates which I made choice of on ariving at my new<br/>
home were young men of the first respectibility in the place yet none of us professed to be guided<br/>
wholey by religious principles Hence we occasionally mingled in parties of pleasure, the Ball room &amp; in<br/>
several instances I took a hand at a game of cards yet I had many fears about taking this step or<br/>
mingling with men who would engage in this dangerous vice yet they were all young men who stood<br/>
high in the estimation of their friends &amp; the world, but the influence of such men whare it is bad is <br/>
the most to be dreaded of any on Earth. becaus the example of the vulgar &amp; disipated will not have<br/>
much influence over the man who intends to maintain a fair standing in society while at the same<br/>
time he might yield to the influence of respectable men in society even to do wrong even to that degree that<br/>
before he is aware of it that he finds that he has sacraficed his time, talents &amp; property for that which<br/>
has done him no good, but brought upon him sorrow, disgrace, misery, &amp; sore repentance &amp; in many instances<br/>
when it is to late to redeem himself. But I felt that the hand of the Lord was over me in this thing as well as in<br/>
evry thing Els for whenever I have y<s>e</s>ielded to the enticement of my associats to stake any thing at the card table<br/>
I had the good fortune in almost evry instance to loose it. I did not however loose but a small amount in<br/>
this way untill I made a strong resolution that I would entirely forsake this vice if no other before I gained<br/>
much of a taste or desire for it which resolution I have always kept. There was a spirit at work with me<br/>
in all recreation the card table, ball room, or any party of pleasure that drew my mind away I took no pleasure<br/>
in those things whatever my anticipations were they all fled when I arived at the spot I seemed to be as a <br/>
spekled birds in the midst of my associates they all seemed to enjoy themselves except me. I at times <br/>
wondered why it was so, but I have since learned there was nothing there which fed the immortal<br/>
mind. Before I commenced doing business for myself I had not acquired much taste for reading with<br/>
the intention of obtaining solid information from books neither had I improved my time in school as I ought to have</p>",
42828.0,21,1827-11-25,"<p>done and I now found that I had several leasure hours each day &amp; I felt satisfyed that it was not my duty<br/>
to squander away this leasure time but the question arose in my mind what I should do with<br/>
it. I did not like novel reading because it was a fiction &amp; did not store the mind with truth or knowledge<br/>
as for history I had not acquired a tast for that not having read it. &amp; while reading a school Book I<br/>
found the following true remark ""He that will spend his life in that manner which is most excell-<br/>
ent will find that custom will render it most delightsome."" It made a strong impression upon my<br/>
mind so I immediately commenced to spend my leasure hours the first year in reading history but the greatest<br/>
difficulty with me was I read a great deal more than I could digest, remember or profit by I soon found I gained<br/>
a taste for reading History I obtained an interest in ^it^ which grew upon me. While perusing History we hold<br/>
convers with men of Judgement wisdom &amp; knowledge &amp; by persueing this course we can lay up an extensive<br/>
fund of valuable information. I commenced by reading the History of the United States; of [[England|England]], [[Scotland|Scotland]],<br/>
[[Greece|Greece]], [[Rome|Rome]], Rollins Ancient History, [[Josephus|Josephus]] and others which I took much interest in and finally I took<br/>
hold of the Bible for History And I never have found as interesting a history as the Bible while reading that<br/>
Book we convers as it were with the Lord &amp; with the Prophets &amp; Apostles of God &amp; while studying the<br/>
[[word of God|word of God]] we learn thruths which cannot be obtained from any other source &amp; those Books which<br/>
contain the revelations of Heaven are of far more interest than those books containing alone the opinions<br/>
theories &amp; doctrins of man.</p>

<p>While living with Aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Wheeler]] or during the first year of my stay<br/>
with her I passed through anoth scene of a revival of religion among the Prysbetarians who were the prevailing<br/>
religion of that place I listened the teachings of Elder Kellogg the minister of the place &amp; attended the<br/>
meetings of the people But the teachings &amp; principle were not such as I believed in or such as I believed<br/>
should belong to the Church of Christ, &amp; I do not think that I obtained any special benefit during<br/>
this religious Excitement. In the midst of it I was called to follow my Brother [[Philo Woodruff|Philo]] to the grave which <br/>
caused me sorrow for a season He was taken suddenly Ill &amp; after a few days illness a Physican was employed<br/>
&amp; ordered him strong doses of <u>Calchicum</u> which was poison &amp; he died <strike>the 2nd</strike> soon after swallowing the second<br/>
dose I accidentally herd of his sickness &amp; went home to see him I spent a few moments in conversing with<br/>
him he seemed comfortable, I lay down to rest a short time with the intention of setting up with him the<br/>
latter part of the night I had not lain long before his [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother]] said to me Philo was in a fit I arose<br/>
walked to his bed side &amp; saw that He was dead I immediately called the Physician who gave him the medicine<br/>
he looked at him &amp; turned away much agitated I considered him poisoned to death He di<strike>a</strike>ed <time datetime=""",11/25/1827
42828.0,21,,""">Nov 25 1827</time><br/>
He had a dream a few month before which troubled his mind much. He dreamed there was a Angel<br/>
arived from Heaven &amp; was going through the streets with a roll containing a list of the Deaths of the people<br/>
in that Town during that year And the Angel approached him &amp; unrolled his list &amp; told him<br/>
that there would be funeral attended at his Fathers House on the 27<sup><u>th</u></sup> of Nov He recorded it in his<br/>
Journal &amp; on that vary day he was buried himself.</p>

<p>Soon after I was called to set up for the night<br/>
with the corps of a young man by the name of [[Henry Miller|Henry Miller]] who was vary wicked &amp; profane He<br/>
had been the day before to a celebration of the [[Independence Day|4<sup><u>th</u></sup> of July]] &amp; his Father was a religious man &amp; reproved<br/>
him for his Profanity &amp; wickedness, &amp; while going into the Field to get up some Hay their came up <br/>
a sudden thunder shower. &amp; He<strike>a</strike>nry mocked God &amp; the thunder &amp; in a moment he was struct dead<br/>
standing near his Father I attended his <strike>Father</strike> funeral &amp; it made a deep impression upon my mind<br/>
I remained with Aunt Wheeler during 3 year &amp; 10 days but I lost a good share of my wages by loaning my money<br/>
to an unprincipled young man by the name of [[William Sage|W<sup><u>m</u></sup> Sage]] &amp; Joining my Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] in Fitting out [[Ezra Hart|Ezra Hart]]<br/>
on a padling expedition he turned crazy &amp; lost nearly all we sent out by him I left Aunt Wheelers Family</p>",

<p>Up to this period I have spent my life a little like a ship tosted upon the waves of the sea up &amp; dow^n^ unstable<br/>
&amp; unsettelled in my mind, at times tr<strike>i</strike>ying to worship the Lord &amp; living th<strike>at</strike>e life of a christian &amp; then at other times<br/>
giving it up &amp; trying to take pleasure in the the things of the world, but in the midst of it all there seemed to<br/>
be an unseen hand guiding my destiny. I had now arived at 23 years of age and I sensibly realized &amp; <br/>
deeply Felt that my youth had gone to return no more forever to me, and I felt that I had spent a good deal <br/>
of my time in a manner that was not profitable to me not that I had been guilty of committing any Heinous<br/>
or outbreaking sins such as Murder, theft, Adultary, Fornications or Blasphamies, yet I ha<strike>g</strike>d a good deal <br/>
of my youth in vanity &amp; folly giving way at times to many idle words and vain and foolish recreations<br/>
which did not store the mind with knowledge or produce any profitable fruit. At this time I reflected<br/>
deeply upon the past &amp; I became thoroughly convinced that there was no real peace or Enjoyment in any<br/>
thing except in the servi<strike>t</strike>ce of God or in those things which the Lord would Approbate. And I came to a<br/>
determined firm resolution in my own mind that from this time henceforth &amp; forever I would seek<br/>
the Lord with all my heart, I would seek to know his will by faith, Prayer, &amp; the reading of the<br/>
[[word of God|word of God]], and I was determined to follow the dictation of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy spirit]] and do the [[will of God|will of God]] as<br/>
far as I could learn it. I brought before my mind in my meditation all the honor, glory &amp; happiness of<br/>
the whole world as far as I could grasp in my imagination I placed before my mind the gold &amp; wealth<br/>
of the miser. The glory grandure &amp; power of Monarchs, kings, Princes Presidents &amp; Rulers. The military<br/>
Renown of [[Alexander the Great of Macedon|Allexander]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte of France|Napoleon]] &amp; other Military Generals. I cast my mind through the innumerable paths<br/>
through which the giddy world travel in search of pleasure happiness, &amp; Joy, and in suming the whole matter<br/>
up in the vision of my mind I had to exclaim with [[Solomon (OT)|Solomon]] that it was all ""vanity of vanities, or all is vanity<br/>
saith the preacher"" I could see that it would all find one common grave in a few short days and I was<br/>
thoroughly convinced that no man could enjoy true happiness &amp; peace &amp; obtain that which would feed<br/>
the immortal mind. Except God was his friend, and Jesus Christ his Advocate, &amp; he done their will &amp; kept<br/>
their commands. Upon this ground I felt determined to stand &amp; spend my future life.</p>

<p>I made an ingagement with Mr [[Samuel Collins|Samuel Collins]] of [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsville]] C<strike>d</strike>t (the manufact<strike>r</strike>urer of the Collinses<br/>

being of a vain worldly turn of mind I did not enjoy myself in their company and I change my<br/>
boarding place took up my residence in a private family by the name of [[Dudly D. Sacket|Dudly D. Sacket]].<br/>
About this time a Reformation broke out in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Connecticut mostly conducted by<br/>
the Methodist denomination My younger brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel H. Woodruff]] made a profession<br/>
of Religion and seemed to be vary much ingaged in the cause which was a great consolation<br/>
to me I attended there meetings and felt to regoic<strike>ed</strike>e to see my brother so much ingaged in<br/>
trying to serve the Lord &amp; acting up to the best light he had. I had a great Desire to do the<br/>
will of God &amp; to know what to do to be saved I prayed night &amp; day as I had an oppertunity<br/>
&amp; the Lord Blessed me with much of his Holy Spirit and I was happy, all things to me seemed<br/>
to praise the Lord the soon [sun], Moon &amp; stars, sky, air land and water, Montains Hills rocks &amp; Dales, forests<br/>
groves meadows &amp; grain all things seemed to praise the Lord. it began to me to be the Hapiest period of <br/>
my life. I had often herd those feelings expressed by individuals but to me it was a blind story untill<br/>
now. My Feelings brought plainly to my mind the words of the <strike>Sl</strike>Psalmest [[David (OT)|David]] whare he plainly expresses</p>",
42828.0,23,,"<p>[[David (OT)|his]] feelings upon this subject when he called upon the Rocks, woods, Mountains, &amp; hills to Praise the Lord He<br/>
calls upon the waves of the sea to praise their God ""He says the Mountains skiped like rams &amp; the Little<br/>
Hills like lambs. He exclaimed what ailed <strike>thee</strike>ye ye mountains that ye skiped like rams &amp; ye little Hills like<br/>
lambs.[""] now my impression is that the mountains did not move but it was the feelings of the Psalmest he was filled<br/>
with such a sense of the [[love of God|Love of God]] &amp; that these th<strike>e</strike>ings were the work of his hands &amp; that God was in them &amp;<br/>
that they were praiseing him, this feelings is enjoyed more or less at times by all who are governed and<br/>
controlled by the [[Holy Spirit|Holy spirit]]. I felt to resolve more and more that I would spend my whole life in the service<br/>
of the Lord. My work was very light in the Mill and I had much leasure time for reading, meditation<br/>
&amp; prayer and I began to read the bible with a more prayerful attention than ever before in my life and<br/>
I found it to be a new book to me it contained truths of the most glorious &amp; sublime nature if I wish for<br/>
History I could find it there. If I was cast down or tried or tempted I there found a remidy in con-<br/>
nextion with the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]]. The Lord is the author of the Book and his promises swep away the darkness<br/>
from my mind. The more I prayed &amp; searched the word of God the more I felt my own weekness &amp; dependence<br/>
upon the Lord. I felt to pray that the Lord would enlighten my my mind, enlarge my heart &amp; give me wisdom<br/>
&amp; understanding.</p>

<p>The reformation continued in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], and a number of my relatives<br/>
were deeply ingaged in the service of the Lord according to the best light they have among whom was uncle<br/>
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozen Woodruff]] &amp; his wife [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah Woodruff]] unto whom I have been much attached all my life having lived a<br/>
good deal with them during my early life I attended meetings freequently with them and Enjoyed<br/>
myself much in their society</p>

<p>There was an Island but a short distance from the Mill the center of which was an ^open^ level field<br/>
covered with wildflowers of various kinds, the Island was surrounded with a rapid current of water, dashing<br/>
over rock, the banks of which were thickly studied with tall waving pines. I chose this Island day &amp; <br/>
night as my place of retirement for prayer, praise &amp; meditation before the Lord I spent many a midnight<br/>
hour alone upon that Island in prayer before the Lord, and the many happy hours in sweet meditation<br/>
which I spent in my lonely walks upon that Plesant retreat I shall never forget in time. The words <br/>
of [[Robert Pollak|Robert Pollock]] in one of his poems often came to my mind while sitting alone in that solitary place<br/>
where He says ""In the wide desert where the view was large, <br/>
""Plesant were many scenes but most to me,  <br/>
""The solitude of vast extant, untouched by hand of art, <br/>
""Whose natured sowed herself, and reaped her crops.<br/>
""Whose garments were the clouds, whose minstrels Brooks,<br/>
""Whose lamps the Moon &amp; stars, whose organ choir the voice of many waters, <br/>
""whose banquits the falling de<strike>es</strike>ws, whose heroes storms, <br/>
""whose warriors mighty winds, whose lovers flowers,<br/>
""Whose orators the thunderbolts of God,<br/>
""Whose palaces the Everlasting hills,<br/>
""Whose ceiling heavens unfathomable blue,<br/>
""And from whose rocky turrets batteled high,<br/>
""Prospects immens spread out on all sides in air,<br/>
""Lost now between the walk in and the main,<br/>
""Now walked with hills that slept above the storm</p>

<p>The roaring waters, the waving pines, giving room to the passing winds, the field of flowers crusted with <br/>
the silver rays of the moon, being all open to the eye and ear while the curtain of heaven <strike>clo</strike> decked with the stars<br/>
and moon mingling with the survey. These things resting upon my mind as the handy work of God in connextion<br/>
with prayer &amp; meditation accompanied by the Holy spirit, gave unto me peculiar charm, sensation Joy &amp; happiness<br/>
which I had never before enjoyed &amp; experienced in my life. The Lord Blessed me with joy happiness &amp; consolation<br/>
becaus I was acting up to the best light and knowledge I had, and when a man will do that in any age of the world<br/>
I am satisfied the Lord will bless him. I had no [[Peter (NT)|Peter]], or Apostle, or any man who held the [[Holy Priesthood|holy Priesthood]] to lead me<br/>
or teach me the way to be saved. So I had to do the <strike>way</strike>best way I could. I got up prayer meetings in our village &amp; prayed</p>",
42828.0,24,1831-03-05,"<p>for light and knowledge. I attended a methodist camp meeting in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Ct. with many of my relatives &amp;<br/>
friends and had an interesting time. I now searched the bible<strike>s</strike> &amp; prayed earnestly to know what duties I should <br/>
perform in order to be saved &amp; I called upon the Lord &amp; prayed unto the Lord to guide me in all things both<br/>
temporal &amp; spiritual &amp; the Lord did manifest many things unto me &amp; heard and answered my prayers <br/>
yet I felt that I needed a teacher &amp; leader in the things of God I had a Desire to attend to the ordinances <br/>
of the gospel yet I did not feel disposed to Join any religious sect or church that I was acquainted<br/>
with because I could not see the organization with any sect on earth that was manifest in the days of the prophets<br/>
&amp; Christ and the Apostles. yet I could see that [[baptism by immersion|Baptism by immersion]] was a commandment of God &amp;<br/>
I had a Desire to be baptized and not understanding any thing about the Priesthood or the Authority<br/>
to administer in the ordinances of the Gospel I applyed to a Baptist minister to Baptize me I told him<br/>
at the same time that I did not wish to Join his church &amp; gave him my reasons that I did not consider the<br/>
organization according to the pattern of the Apostolic Church Mr [[George Phippen|George Phippen]] was the name of the<br/>
Baptist Minister at first refused to Baptize me saying that it was against there rules to Baptize any one<br/>
except he joined there church, but after conversing with him several times upon the subject he said<br/>
he would baptize me. So upon the <time datetime=""",03/05/1831
42828.0,24,1831-03-20,""">5<sup>th</sup> day of March 1831</time>, on Saturday Mr Phippen Preached a discourse in<br/>
Farmington upon the subject of Baptism &amp; then went to [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington River]] accompanied by a large congregation<br/>
and Baptized myself &amp; my Brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] and we went our way rejoiceing thinking we had done<br/>
the [[will of God|will of God]]. this is the ownly Gospel ordinance I attempted to attend to untill I joined the Church<br/>
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints [[laying on of hands|hands]] was not laid upon me for the [[Holy Ghost|Holy Ghost]] for it was not practiced<br/>
but I had peace of mind because I acted up to the best light I had at the time.</p>

<p>I did not remain with Mr [[Samuel Collins|Collins]] quite one year he wished to remove his Mill as he wished the water privilege<br/>
for other purposes so I settelled up my business with him &amp; Engaged to tend the Flo<strike>w</strike>uring mill to Mr [[Richard B. Cowles|Richard<br/>
B. Cowles]] of [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]] Ct. when I settled with Mr Collins he gave me a strong invitation to come and<br/>
labour for him should I wish a place &amp; proffered to give me any recommends I should ask. I parted with<br/>
him and his Clerk [[John Barlow|John Barlow]] and with all my acquaintances in that place with the Best of Feelings and I felt<br/>
that I was leaving a place whare I had spent many a pleasing &amp; happy hour, after spending a few days in<br/>
visiting my Friends I went to New Hartford &amp; commenced business for Mr Cowles on the <time datetime=""",03/20/1831
42828.0,24,,""">20 day of March 1831</time><br/>
I spent one year with Mr Cowles During my stay there I attended meetings with the various denominations of the place I also held<br/>
meetings with the young people I found several persons with whom my spirit was congenial with my feelings among whom<br/>
was two men by the name of Lyman &amp; Buel there feelings &amp; views were in a measure similar to my own<br/>
we visited each other much &amp; prayed together often &amp; spent many a good hour together in prayer &amp; conversing<br/>
upon the things of God. there were several protracted meetings in the Town while I was there I freequently<br/>
attended &amp; several ministers asked me to Join their churches I would ask them if they had the faith that was<br/>
once delivered to the saints, if they laid hands upon the sick &amp; had dreams Revelations &amp; visions as did the Ancient<br/>
Saints &amp; if they had Prophets and Apostles they would say no these are not needed now they are done away so<br/>
I could not believe as they did so I did not Join any church but I gave myself constantly to Prayer reading<br/>
the Bible, &amp; meditation and I called upon the Lord Earnestly to lead and guide me I spent many hours in the<br/>
woods among the Rocks &amp; in the mill at midnight calling upon the Lord to teach me what to do I finally made<br/>
the following prayer &amp; petition unto the Lord with a determination to ask untill I obtained an answer ""O Lord<br/>
are the priest &amp; People who profess th<s>e</s>y name and who appear zealous in thy cause by holding many meetings<br/>
&amp; call upon th<strike>e</strike>y name with a loud voice &amp; who labour hard to make many prosel<strike>i</strike>ytes are they th<strike>e</strike>y people are<br/>
they &amp; their works excepted at thine hand. if so O Lord why am I separated from them in spirit</p>",
42828.0,25,,"<p>why cannot I feel at home with them &amp; worship with them why am I left alone like a speckled bird of the<br/>
forest why do they oppose me in those things which the [[spirit of God|spirit]] &amp; [[word of God|word of God]] teach me is true. And again<br/>
if they are not the people of God and are not excepted of thee why do they prosper why do they gather<br/>
many souls unto there churches who appear cincere. And if they are not the people of the Lord where<br/>
shall I find th<strike>e</strike>y people O Lord show me these things and teach me what to do and I covenant to<br/>
obey thy voice and do thy will, and after praying earnestly onto the Lord with this prayer on a<br/>
certain night in my mill untill after midnight the [[spirit of the Lord|spirit of the Lord]] rested upon me &amp; the voice of<br/>
the spirit of the Lord said unto me go to my word &amp; I will there show thee my will and answer<br/>
thy prayer. I opened the Bible promiscously praying the Lord in my heart to direct my mind to<br/>
that portion of his word which would answer my prayes &amp; show me the truth and I opened to the<br/>
LVI Chapter of Isaiah which I read and was satisfied that it was in answer to my prayer. I was satisfied<br/>
the salvation of God was abot to be revealed and his righteousness to come forth I was also satisfied that I should<br/>
live to see the people of God gathered, and I should be with them and that I should have a name &amp; a place<br/>
in the [[house of God|House of God]] with his sons and Daughters, and I felt that I ought not any more to say that I was<br/>
utterly seperated from the people of God. I a<strike>s</strike>lso believed that the priests of the day were in great measure like<br/>
the shepherds described in that chapter that they were ignorant and did not understand, and that they all looked<br/>
for their gain from there quarter and that they were not satisfied and were like greedy dogs who could never<br/>
have enough. from that hour I was satisfyed to remain as I was untill I should find the people of God which I<br/>
looked for in faith and believed I should know them when I saw them. I had no one to lead or guide me in the<br/>
way of the Lord except the spirit and word of God, these I tried to cling unto. My mind abut this time was<br/>
deeply exercised upon one principle and that was Keeping the seventh day of the week for the sabbath in[stead]<br/>
of the first day I found that the seventh day was esstablished by the Lord himself as the sabbath day<br/>
and all Israel was commanded to keep it as the sabbath day forever throughout there generation &amp;<br/>
I could never find where the Lord ever changed the sabbath day. Jesus &amp; the Apostles kept the seventh<br/>
day of the week as do all the Jews up to the present time and my mind was troubled upon this subject<br/>
and I was never satisifyed in my mind upon the subject untill I promised the Lord that I would keep that<br/>
day for the sabbath as soon as I was liberated from the gentile yoke so that I could. During the spring of <time datetime=""1832"">1832</time><br/>
while at Mr [[Richard B. Cowles|Cowles]] I read a short article in a News Paper stating that there was a New sect rising up that<br/>
were called Mormons that professed to have the ancient gifts of the gospel they [[heal the sick|healed the sick]], [[casting out devils|cast out devils]]<br/>
[[gift of tongues|spoke in tongues]] and performed miracles as the Apostles did and that they were going up to [[Missouri|Missouri]] to a place<br/>
they called Zion and that they had got a New Book called the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] which was revealed<br/>
to them by an [[Moroni (BofM)|angel]] of God. The Editor of the paper ridiculed the people I heard there was one of the Books<br/>
in [[Barkhamsted, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Barkhampstead]] 10 miles distant from me I felt very anxious to obtain it to read but I did not get an<br/>
oppertunity. I said when I saw the article and read it that I did not care what was said about <br/>
the people if they really had the gifts which the Ancient Saints possessed it was all I would ask, they<br/>
were the very people which I was looking for.</p>

<p>I settelled up my business with Mr Cowles in<br/>
an Amicable manner although he wished me to remain with him yet I had made up my mind to go to the<br/>
Western Country to purchase a farm. for about 2 weeks previous to leaving him my mind was deeply<br/>
exercised upon the subject of going to [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] the spirit that was upon me day and night said<br/>
go to Rhode Island. I called upon my Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon's]] to stop with him untill we should start for the<br/>
west. as soon as the salutation was past I said to him I wondered what the Lord wanted of me in<br/>
Rhode Island for the spirit of the Lord had rested upon me for 2 weeks &amp; said to me go to Rhode Island</p>",
42828.0,26,,"<p>In about one ^hour^ after this my Brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] also arived upon a visit and after shaking hands almost<br/>
the first words which he spoke was I wonder what the Lord wants of me in [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] for the<br/>
[[spirit of the Lord|spirit of the Lord]] has been upon me for two or three weeks and told me to go to Rhode Island this caused<br/>
us to marvel as we had not spoken to each other or seen each other for several months I felt convinced it<br/>
was our duty to go there yet we could not tell what it meant. But Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] thought that as<br/>
we were about prepareing to go to the west we had Better omit it &amp; I reluctantly consented to it. Subsequently I<br/>
learned that at that vary time Elders [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] &amp; [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel H Smith]] was preaching the gospel in that state<br/>
and had we <strike>have</strike> gone we should certainly have embraced the work &amp; Joined the Latter Day Saints<br/>
for we were prepared in our minds to have received the truth at that time But like [[Jonah (OT)|Jonah]] who was<br/>
sent to [[Nineveh|Nineveh]] went to [[Tarshish, Lebanon|Tarshish]] so I insted of going to Rhode Island Prepaired myself &amp; went to<br/>
western [[New York|New York]]. Brother Azmon &amp; myself took each of us a tin trunk with some goods &amp; $800<br/>
dollars in Mon<strike>n</strike>ey and started for the west in the spring of <time datetime=""1832"">1832</time> we called upon Father [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Woodruff]]<br/>
at [[Colebrook, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Colebrook]] Ct whare he had moved a short time previous to attend the flouring Mill of Mr Sage<br/>
we spent a day or two at Fathers House then went on our Journey for the west not knowing whare<br/>
we should go we finally wandered about through the western part of New York finally went north<br/>
of [[Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York|Sarycuse]] into the Town of [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] Oswego County &amp; called upon a man by the name of [[Constant Souls|Constant<br/>
Souls]] &amp; we purchased his Farm of him containing 140 Acres of land a saw mill good Dwelling House Barn<br/>
&amp; orchard for $1800. We Paid down $800, &amp; the remainder afterwards. I made it my home with Mr<br/>
Souls and Azmon returned to [[Connecticut|Connecticut]] for his Family He soon returned &amp; we commenced farming &amp; fencing<br/>
&amp; lumbering which business we followed together untill the spring of <time datetime=""1834"">1834</time>. As soon as I commenced doing business<br/>
for myself I commenced keeping sat<strike>r</strike>urday the seventh day of the week for the sabbath as did my Brother <br/>
Azmon. we held meetings upon the seventh day and several others in the neighborhood attended the<br/>
meetings with us and kept the same day of the week for the sabbath I also attended with the various<br/>
donominations that were around us freequently. My Brother Azmon had been a vary peculiar person<br/>
from his childhood up He had been vary strict to his bible, his prayers &amp; to his God. He prayed much<br/>
from his childhood &amp; had much of the spirit of the Lord &amp; had much light &amp; I was much edifyed &amp; <br/>
interested with his teaching &amp; conversation He would never employ a physician when sick but always<br/>
trust in the Lord we were in Richland when the cholera first made its appearance into the United States via carrier<br/>
into [[Sackets Harbor, Jefferson County, New York|Sackets Harbor]]. My Brother Azmon had a severe attack of the cholera in the fall of <time datetime=""1833"">1833</time> I [[laying on of hands|laid hands]]<br/>
upon his head with his [[Elizabeth Norton Hart Woodruff|wife]] according to his request &amp; prayed for him and Asked the Lord in the name of <br/>
Jesus Christ to rebuke his desease &amp; command it to Depart from him &amp; the cholera was stayed from the hour<br/>
and in the morning He was able to walk about &amp; He immediately recovered. this had always been his faith<br/>
from his youth up He had been through some severe fits of sickness but would not empl[o]y any medical aid<br/>
but always trusted in God, believing it was his privilege to be healed by the prayer of faith and the laying on<br/>
of hands as it was in Ancient days this was the state of mind we were both in when the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness of the gospel]]<br/>
reached us by an [[Zerah Pulsipher|Elder]] of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. we were looking to find a people<br/>
who would build up the Ch<strike>irst</strike>urch of Christ according to the Ancient Pattern. Thus I have given a Brief synopsis<br/>
of my life &amp; experience up to the time of my Embracing the fulness of the gospel &amp; Joining the Latter day Saints which<br/>
event was one of Great Joy to me which laid the foundation of a greater &amp; more glorious work then<br/>
ever I expected to see in this life &amp; I Pray God in the name of Jesus Christ to guide my future life<br/>
that I may live to his honor &amp; glory &amp; be a benefit to my Fellow man and at last be saved in his<br/>

[[Elizabeth Norton Hart Woodruff|wife]] informed them that we would <strike>light</strike> wish to hear them Accordingly they gave out an appointment for<br/>
preaching in the school house that evening when I arived home my sister in law informed me that there<br/>
would be a mormon meeting in the school House that evening. I immediately turned out my horses &amp; without waiting<br/>
to eat my supper started for the school House I prayed all the way in my heart that the Lord would open my understa-<br/>
nding &amp; give me his spirit and if they were men of God &amp; had the truth I prayed that I might receive it I arived at<br/>
the school House in this frame of mind without any prejudice in my heart and when I arived the House<br/>
was crouded full I went alone my Brother Azmon had gone before me I crouded my way through the Assembly<br/>
and got upon one of the writing desks whare I could see Brother Pulsipher opened the meeting by Prayer He<br/>
knelt down and asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ for what He wanted his manner of praying<br/>
struck me vary forcibly &amp; I felt the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]] bear testimony that He was a servant of God He arose &amp; sung<br/>

he said was true. I believed it when he closed He was followed by Brother Cheney who bore testimony<br/>
that what had been said was true Brother Pulsipher then gave liberty to any one in the congregation to<br/>
make any remarks either for or against what had been said. And almost instantly I found myself<br/>
upon my feet without any intention upon my part of speaking but when I foun<strike>e</strike>d myself upon my<br/>
feet I felt urged by the spirit to bear testimony to the truth of what I had heard so I exhorted my neighbors<br/>
&amp; friends to be careful what they done as touching those m<strike>o</strike>en not to oppose them for they were the servants<br/>
of God &amp; had preached the pure gospel of Jesus Christ unto us this night &amp; I warn you in the name of the Lord not<br/>
to oppose them but to search the scriptures diligently to see if those things are so. when I closed my Brother Azmon<br/>
arose &amp; also bore testimony to the truth of the work &amp; he was followed by several others at the close of the<br/>
meeting I went to the Brethren and asked them to go home with me they did &amp; we had a good deal of conversation<br/>
with them. I took the Book of Mormon &amp; went to reading it &amp; the spirit of God bore testimony to me that the<br/>
Book was true I believed it we sat up till a late hour. I felt to open my Eyes to see, my Ears to hear, &amp; my heart<br/>

[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the Prophet Seer &amp; Revelator whom God has raised up in these [[last days|last day]] to esstablish<br/>
his Church &amp; kingdom in the Last days &amp; to bring forth Revelation unto the children of man this<br/>
was the most important event of my life as far as my feelings were concerned Although my<br/>
first introductions to him was of that Nature that might have been calculated to have tried the feelings &amp; faith<br/>
of some men wh<strike>at</strike>o had formed in there own mind how a Prophet would look &amp; act for when I first saw<br/>
him &amp; his Brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]] they were shooting at a mark with a brace of Pistols when they stoped shooting<br/>
I was introduced to them Brother Joseph shook hands Hartily with me &amp; invited me to go to his house &amp;<br/>
make his habitation my home while I stayed in Kirtland I gladly excepted the invitation &amp; went home<br/>
in a few moments he brought into the room a wolf skin &amp; said come Brother Woodruff I want you to<br/>
help me tan this wolf skin as I want to put it on my seat while I go my Journey to the west so I pulled<br/>
off my coat rolled up my sleeves &amp; went at it &amp; soon taned it over a chair post. while employed at<br/>
this I smiled at the appearance of my first labour with the prophet but during the evening He was conversing about<br/>
the camps going to Zion. He was filled with the [[spirit of the Lord|spirit of the Lord]] He smote upon his breast and said I would<br/>
to God I could unbosom my feelings in the House of my Friends Among his remarks in the evening He<br/>
said dont be discouraged Brethren about our not having means to go to Zion will the Lord will provide<br/>
means &amp; He will put it into the Heart of somebody to send me some money. next day he received a Letter<br/>
from Sister [[Mary Polly Vose|Vose]] containing $150. when He opened the Letter &amp; took out the money He exclaimed see here did<br/>
I not tell you last evening that the Lord would send me some money to help us on our Journey here it is<br/>
I was perfectly satisfyed that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I here became acquainted with <br/>

<p>""Brother Wilford I wish to call your Attention a few moments while we take a glance at what is<br/>
called Mormonism. you well know that my mind was tryed on the subject before you left us in<br/>
the spring. I have since you left endeavored to look at the subject with an impartial Eye and<br/>
weigh it in an ^even^ balance and try it by Gods word and spirit, even the word spoken by the Ancient Apostles<br/>
and Prophets and by Christ himself and if any man speak not according to this word Judge ye<br/>
whether in such a case it is right to receive or not."" ""[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] says by Revelation that there<br/>
shall be 500 ^or less^ of the Lords warriors or valiant <strike>men</strike>young men and middle Aged raised who should go up to<br/>
Redeem and Defend Zion, and you are not ignorant Brother of their taken carnal weapons such as<br/>
fire Arms spears dirks swords &amp;c &amp;c. Jesus Christ sayes put up thy sword into its sheath all they that taketh <br/>
the sword shall perish with the sword [##Matthew 26:52##]. Further more Jesus say<strike>e</strike>s if thine Enemy hunger feed him if he thirst<br/>
give him drink [##Romans 12:20##]. Again love ye your Enemies bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you<br/>
and pray for them that despitefully use ^you^ and persecute you [##Matthew 5:44##], and all this for what, the answer is that ye may<br/>
be like your [[Father in Heaven|Father in heaven]]. Again Jesus says unto you that ye resist not evil if <strike>the</strike> a man smite you<br/>
on the one cheek, offer the other also [##Matthew 5:39##]. He did not say after you have been smitten once, thrice or twice take the<br/>
sword and fight and slay your enemies, but the contrary, he taught both by precept and example. And<br/>
perhaps you may ask shall we suffer our Enemies to destroy us. shall we suffer ourselves to be trodden down<br/>
as the mire of the streets and make no resistance. In answer I would say If we take Jesus for an<br/>
Ensample sure it is that we should not fight and resist evil. for when was our great Ensample<br/>
ever known to retaliate or resist, or revenge or take vengance. No this He never done but suffered<br/>
himself to be lead as a sheep to the slaughter and like a Lamb before his shearers &amp;c"" [##Isaiah 53:7##] Now Brother<br/>
how near a like is the procedings of the Mormons and example and precepts of Christ I will tell you""</p>",
42828.0,37,,"<p>as much alike as light and darkness. And there is as much agreement <strike>between</strike> in the proceedings of the morm-<br/>
ons and their preceps &amp; examples of Christ as there is between Christ and Balial and no more. If I am able to<br/>
Judge in this respect. If they persecute you in this city flee ye into another [##Matthew 10:23##] does this look like disputeing<br/>
the ground with the point of the sword at the peril of our lives. there is much in the Testimony if my limits would<br/>
admit that I would like to call your attention unto but cannot at this time"" ""There is one thing more<br/>
however that I cannot forbear to mention and that is division in families or rather breaking up of families<br/>
as to the revelations upon this point I am not so well informed, but have understood from the Brethren from <br/>
different se<strike>t</strike>ctions that it was the duty of heads of families or say the Husband or man as he is the head if he is a<br/>
believer it is his duty to <strike>forsake</strike> ^pursuade^ his wife to go with him up to Zion if in his power but if she will not be pursuaded<br/>
to go with him, then it is his duty to gather up his substance and go up to Zion and leave his wife &amp; family behind<br/>
Now I would ask what is there in the [[Old Testament|Old]] or [[New Testament|New Test<strike>i</strike>ament]] that will support a man in such a course as this the<br/>
[[Mark (NT)|Apostle]] says if the unbelieveing depart let him depart but there is no liberty given to the believer to leave one of his<br/>
family what God hath joined together let no man put assunder. [##Mark 10:9##] Now for instance were I to leave my family &amp; take<br/>
with me my substance (if I had any) and go up to Zion should I not according to the testimony (not of Mormonism) but of<br/>
Eternal truth be under censure,"" ""should I not be one that refused to provide for his own, even those of his own house<br/>

And I must receive Smiths Revelations and reject Christs or Receive Christs &amp; the Apostles &amp; reject Smith's As<br/>
I cannot be vary particular here I will ownly ask you to look at one or two. What does the Revelations say concerning<br/>
the Lords warriors the Revelations says as I understood [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] That inasmuch as 500 of the Lords warriors &amp; <br/>
valiant young men &amp;c raised &amp;c &amp; if 500 could not be had 400, 300, 200 or 100 but not to return less than 100 [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:32-34##] And<br/>
I understood the Revelation to say that with them I would redeem Zion and if I understood your letter there was over<br/>
200 went up in the [[Zion|camp]] to redeem Zion armed with various weapons of war. Now the Revelation says that<br/>
Zion cannot be redeemed because the strength of the [[Lord|Lords House]] has not come up"" Again you say that the Lord<br/>
says by revelation that He is well pleased with those who have come up even as he was pleased with [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]]<br/>
And we know that God was so well pleased with Abraham that He swore to him with an oath. Yet we are<br/>
informed that the Lord sent the [[destroying angel|destroying Angel]] into your camp to purge &amp; clense it. Now Brother if you cannot<br/>
see any impropriety and contradiction in those Revelations as well as others, then I <strike>i</strike>entreat you to stop for <br/>
a moment and consider and look again, also the Revelation concerning their stay at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] at first it<br/>
was to be but 5 years, now there is to be a [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] built there, and it is to be one of the stake of Zion not to<br/>
be removed &amp;c."" ""I intreat my Brother for Heavens sake &amp; for your own souls <strike>sake</strike> &amp; Body sake to look at<br/>
those things &amp; compare them with themselves &amp; with others of the Revelations And also try them by [[word of God|<strike>g</strike>Gods word]]<br/>
&amp; [[spirit of God|spirit]] &amp; see if the spirit of truth which cannot lie, you the spirit of inspiration of the Almighty moving<br/>
upon Joseph Smith caused them to be uttered and written for our learning and profit. And whereas two cannot<br/>
walk together except they be agreed. and as I understand that God is love &amp; he that dwelleth in God dwelleth in love &amp;<br/>
God dwelleth in him [##1 John 4:16##] and that love works no ill to his neighbor [##Romans 13:10##], the [[fruits of the spirit|fruits of the spirit]] are peace, joy, longsuffering<br/>
gentleness &amp;c [##Galatians 5:22##]. I do confess that I never so learned Christ as to learn war or a disposition to return an injury<br/>
to mine Enemy but on the contrary Gods word &amp; spirit teaches to keep co^a^les of fire on the Heads of our Enemies<br/>
by rendering good for Evil and Blessing for cursing""—** ""I would inform you that in the fore part of July I requ[es]ted<br/>

Church in [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] possess. Once their was nobody like Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Woodruff]] now he is so bad. If it was<br/>
in their power I think they would sift me as wheat. I am glad for one thing and that is my soull,<br/>
nor my body my time nor my Eternity is not at their disposal, if it was I should greatly fear <br/>
what would become of me. If they are a fair sample of mormonism god Lord Deliver me from<br/>
it."" ""I think it likely you will see me published in the [[New York Star|star]]. I though[t] I would be to quick<br/>
for them but do not know but I shall see how far they will go in doing by others as they<br/>
would wish others to do by them. I do not doubt but that many sincere honest souls have<br/>
gone into the work, such I think will come forth when they see they are going counter<br/>
to the [[testimony of Jesus|testimony of Jesus Christ]]. You may perhaps think me to severe. But I can<br/>
say if I know my own heart that I desire to know the truth yes that truth that maketh<br/>
free [##John 8:32-33##] and that brings not into bondage to any man. I think that I realize in some degree that<br/>
fire shall try evry mans work of what sort it is [##1 Corinthians 3:13##]. O may the good Lord help us so to build that when the<br/>
burning days shall come our works shall a bide the fire and come forth as the most fine gold which may<br/>
the Lord grant for his sons sake. Yours in the flesh and I trust in the Lord. Azmon Woodruff</p>

<strike>The following is the Answer which I sent to my Brother Azmon Woodruff in reply to the foregoing Letter</strike></p>

<p>Dear Brother Wilford. I write to inform you that I have arived at home in Richland and found to my<br/>
disappointment that you had gone * * Your [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] and we all feel vary bad to think you have gone after such<br/>
<strike>eronius</strike> Erronious principles. we think you must be vary much deceived. Why not stay whare you was and worship<br/>
your God under the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth and with liberty. And you must know that it is a<br/>
great disappointment to your friends to have you go and leave them. It is my wish to have you leave mormonism <br/>
and come back, but you can do as you please. But whether we meet in time or not is vary uncertain<br/>
but I hope the Lord will forgive us all at last. Your Affectionate Brother Thompson Woodruff</p>

<p>The following is the Answer which I sent to my Brethren Azmon &amp; Thomson Woodruff in reply to the foregoing Letters</p>

<p>[[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]] Clay County Missouri <time datetime=""",11/29/1834
42828.0,38,,""">Nov 29<sup><u>th</u></sup> 1834</time></p>

<p>To all my Kinsfolks in Richland. I received your letter<br/>
under date of Aug 9<sup><u>th</u></sup> But have not attempted to Answer it untill the present time. But being sensible that<br/>
time is short with many of this generation, I feel desireous to address you by letter as I think it vary uncertain<br/>
whether I ever ^shall^ behold your faces again untill I <strike>f</strike> meet you at the [[bar of God|bar]] of the <strike>g</strike>Great Jehovah. I would inform <br/>
you that my health is good and at present I possess a contented mind. It rejoices my soul that the Lord<br/>
hath speared my life to the present time and supported me through so many dangers seen and unseen<br/>
both temporally and spiritually and embraced me within the [[new and everlasting covenant|new and Everlasting covenant]] and given me the<br/>
privilege of Enjoying the society of those [[servants of God|servants of God]] who are determined to follow Christ through evil as<br/>
well as good report. Brethren; it was a satisfaction to me to hear from you, yet some of the contents of<br/>
your letters <strike>g</strike>caused me pain and that too for your sakes. And in answering your letter I must answer my ^own^<br/>
mind and clear my soul of your Blood, that your Blood be not required at my hands at the bar of God.<br/>
And could I have the privilege I would rather clear my mind by conversing face to face than by writing<br/>
but as I am wholey deprived of that privilege I feel it my duty to do it by writing and also to answer some<br/>
of your questions. Brethren in answering your letter I have no desire to injure your feelings yet I must<br/>
be plain and answer my mind and what I say to you I shall say with a realizeing sens that I shall one<br/>
day be called to give an account for this act to that God who has made me &amp; redeemed my soul.<br/>
Brother Thompson let me answer you by saying that the cause of my leaving Richland when and</p>",
42828.0,39,,"<p>as I did was not to injure you or out of any ill will towards you but I did this act with a settelled belief<br/>
that it was my duty. And I am more and more convinced that I did my duty in so doing. I acknowledge<br/>
your question to be vary civil in asking me wh<strike>i</strike>y I ""could not stay whare I was and worship God under<br/>
the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth and with Liberty."" In answering this question I would<br/>
say that you have the sentiments of my heart when I say that I verily believe that [[Lot (OT)|Lot]] would have<br/>
been as safe to have remained in Sodom after being warned to flee out by the Angel of God as I should<br/>
have been to have remained in [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], calculating to make it my abiding place with the light I had<br/>
before me. No I could not remain there and worship God under the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth<br/>
because the voice to me is, come out of her ye my people that ye partake not of her sins that ye receive not of her<br/>
plagues [##Revelation 18:4##]. Brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] you may be assured that God hath not finished his work on the Earth &amp;<br/>
his <strike>w</strike>sword is hathed in heaven and will soon fall upon Idumea or the world [##Isaiah 34:5##] yea I believe that<br/>
most awful events await this generation yea I believe God is about to exhort his power to overthrow Babylon<br/>
and to shake both Earth and heaven. yea I believe that sword pestilence and famine await this generation<br/>
of the human family who do not repent and turn unto God and [[stand in holy places|stand in Holy places]]. Brother Thompson<br/>
I feel deeply interested in your welfare and salvation both Temporally and spiritually both for time <br/>
&amp; Eternity therefore let me this once perhaps for the last time war<s>e</s>n you to prepare to meet your <strike>g</strike>God and<br/>
also this once not to despise &amp; reject the revelations of Jesus Christ for he will soon come to judge every man<br/>
for the deeds done in the body. Brother Thompson what more can I say to you, it is a day of warning<br/>
&amp; not of many words [##Doctrine and Covenants 63:58##], the day is not far distant when you will know of a truth whether the cause<br/>
in which I am Engaged is of God or from a source of Darkness and Error. Yea I verily believe the<br/>
hour is nigh at the door that will report in the Ears of those who remain in Babylon far more heart rending scenes <br/>
respecting the things which await them &amp; will overtake them than you are permitted to receive from my pen.<br/>
Although I should incur the displeasure of many of my fellow men or even my relatives by the [[grace of God|grace of<br/>
God]] assisting me I shall not scease to exhort my influence or to lift my voice to warn this generation to prepare<br/>
themselves to be accounted worthy to escape the Just Judgements of God that awaits this generation. I do not<br/>
expect to remain stationary long in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] But I expect to travel south during the winter how much<br/>
longer I do not know * * Brother Thompson I now bid you farewell and I desire that while the kingdoms<br/>
of this world are overturning that you may receive and obey the [[Celestial Law|celestial Law]] of God that you may abide<br/>
a [[celestial glory|celestial Glory]] And that God will Enlighten your understanding to that degree that you may so improve<br/>
the blessings which are within your reach in the last days so as to find a seat in the [[celestial kingdom|Celestial Kingdom]] of God with<br/>
[[Abraham (OT)|Abram]] [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] and [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]] is the prayer of your Absent Brother Wilford Woodruff</p>

<p>Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] I not ownly feel it a privilege but my duty to address you <strike>this</strike> again by writing and<br/>
answer some of your questions given to me in your communication. I am sensible we cannot give<br/>
a fair representation of things by writing as by word of mouth. We are more liable to form wrong<br/>
conceptions of things by letter (even where the intention is good) than by word of mouth. The questions<br/>
which you have asked in your letter appear very clear to me and could I see you I think I could <s>e</s><br/>
explain them to your satisfaction but it is a thing almost impossible to do it upon one sheet of paper<br/>
yet I feel it my duty to say a few words respeting some of them as it respects carnal weapons being<br/>
used by the saints of God in the last days there is much said up on the subject by the Ancient Prophets<br/>
The Plough shares are to be beat into swords &amp; the pruneing hooks into spears, Let th[e] weak say I am strong [##Joel 3:10##]<br/>
Yea, one is to chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight [##Deuteronomy 32:30##] this is to take place in Gods own time<br/>
in the [[last days|last days]]. It is to be said to Zion, (according to the Prophet [[Isaiah (OT)|Isaiah]]) that her horn should be made</p>",
42828.0,40,,"<p>""Iron and her hoofs Brass and she should beat, in peaces many people &amp;c"" [##Micah 4:13##] As it respects the remark I made<br/>
about the Lord's being pleased with those who came up in th[e] [[Zion|camp of Zion]] or they being compared with<br/>
[[Abraham (OT)|Abram]], it was their offering which he was pleased with. that is to say they were willing to lay down <br/>
thare lives for Christs sake and the sake of their Brethren. Yet He was not pleased with any murmurings<br/>
or complainings that might be in the camp but rather they were chastized for it, some mens sins go<br/>
to judgment beforehand while others follow after. Again as it respects [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] being a stake of Zion<br/>
there never has been any revelation given to infringe upon Kirtland's being a stake of Zion or <br/>
bearing any import why it should not become a stake &amp; evry word of the Lord be fulfilled.<br/>
Because the Lord said He would not hold any guilty who should go up to Zion with an open<br/>
heart, after the space of 5 years, which time the Lord willeth to retain a strong hold in the Land of <strike>Zion</strike><br/>
Kirtland [##Doctrine and Covenants 64:21-22##]. This saying does not prove that Kirtland will not be a stake of Zion for a longer <br/>
period than 5 years but it goes to show that the Lord wished many of his servants to remain in<br/>
Kirtland that length of time for a special purpose. Neither does it prove because the Lord<br/>
has commanded his people to build unto his name a [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] or a city that it will not eventually<br/>
be thrown down. Again you say that if the brethren or sisters in [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] are a fair sample<br/>
of Mormonism you wish to be delivered from it. I wish to ask you if you consider such means<br/>
a fair way to investigate the subject, if they as members of the Church of Christ have done wrong<br/>
does this prove that the whole body is corrupted or that it is not a true church. Because there was<br/>
a [[Judas (NT)|Judas]] with Christ and the Apostles, does that prove that they were fals teachers or Christ a<br/>
fals Prophet certainly not. Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] I think it is for the want of intelligence &amp; <br/>
information that causes you to discover such gross Errors and contradictions (as in your view)<br/>
there is in the Revelations given in there last days. for my part I cannot discover any<br/>
contradictions in themselves or that contradicts the teachings, precepts, &amp; revelations of Jesus<br/>
Christ our Savior. But rather I behold them beaming with gospel light, truth intelligence and glory<br/>
Brother Azmon I was not a little surprised to learn from your letter that you had denyed and<br/>
rejected the Revelations of Jesus Christ for I know them to be such which you have rejected. I<br/>
say I was not a little surprised to learn this fact after your having received as great a degree of<br/>
light as you have in your day and generation. Let me this one call your mind to review the past with<br/>
reflection, and at the same time permit me to ask you some questions. I wish you to call to mind the days and<br/>
years of your youth. while standing as it were alone to maintain and contend for that faith once delivered<br/>
to the Saints. Also the many times you have stood and proclaimed in the ears of this generations those<br/>
things which awaited them if they rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ. Again have you not long been<br/>
looking for the Church of Christ to arise out of the wilderness of darkness and Error yea when you<br/>
heard the sound of the gospel proclaimed did you not gladly receive it with your whole soul and went<br/>
forth and was baptized the first sermon that you herd an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter<br/>
day saints deliver unto the people. I now wish to ask you, By what spirit was you actuated and moved upon<br/>
when you bore witness unto your fellow men and testifyed unto them that the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]] bore witness to<br/>
you of the truth of the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] and by what spirit was you governed when you went<br/>
to Brother [[Noah Hatton|Holton]] in the name of the Lord and told him if He rejected the work which the Latter Day<br/>
Saints brought unto us that his days would be short and what light he had would be taken from him<br/>
And also when you told [[William Hubbard|W<sup><u>m</u></sup> Hubbard]] that you knew that He would be condemned if He rejected it<br/>
And also when you declaired that you was Delivered both soul and body by the [[laying on of hands|laying on off hands]] of</p>",
42828.0,41,,"<p>Elder [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] in the name of the Lord. I believe that you was actuated and moved upon by the [[spirit of God|spirit of<br/>
God]] yea I believe that you was honest and sincere in those things. And if this was the case let me now<br/>
ask by what spirit are you governed and controlled when you turn around and deny and reject these<br/>
things it certainly is not of God. And now Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] considering exhisting circumstances<br/>
with you I cannot forbear unreservedly telling you what I Believe concerning you and your course<br/>
when I have behel the light and Glory that the [[Celestial Law|Celestial Law]] and [[kingdom of God|kingdom of God]] is presenting to us in these<br/>
[[last days|last days]] it has been a source of Great Enjoyment to me in the reflection that the day was near when<br/>
I should Join with you in the kingdom of God in partaking of those Celestial Immortal and Eternal<br/>
glories But Alas how am I disappointed Brother Azmon unless you repent like [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] and humble<br/>
yourself before God I do not ever expect to meet you there. Dear Sir you have but a faint<br/>
idea of the immortal Joys &amp; glories that you have in a voluntary manner deprived yourself<br/>
the privilege of ever enjoying. I intreat you in Christ stead to stop while to stop is in your<br/>
power and consider the awful calamity and destruction you are bringing upon your own soul.<br/>
I mean by denying the Lord that bought you, and put him to an open shame. perhaps you may<br/>
consider this a light thing But those revelations which you have denyed are the Revelation of Jesus<br/>
Christ And you will soon find it a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God. I had not<br/>
received your letter when I sent you the [[Book of Commandments|Book of Commandments]] and if you have received them<br/>
and consider them of No worth unto you, You will do me a favor by giving them to Brother Fisk<br/>
or to someone in the church of the Latter Day Saints. But above all things I warn you to beware about<br/>
treating those things with disdain or making ridic<s>l</s>ule of them for of a truth if you do they will<br/>
rise in Judgment against you. you now profess to believe those revelations to be of man &amp; not of God<br/>
but should they at last prove to be of God it would be better for you that they had not fallen into your hands<br/>
inasmuch as you treat lightly the things which they contain. But there is no doubt upon my mind upon<br/>
this subject And I again warn you in the name of Jesus Christ that you no more tread lightly those<br/>
Revelations and Commandments for in so doing you treat with disdain the council of the Almighty<br/>
and set at naught the Revelations of Jesus Christ and if you continue to do those things they will serve<br/>
to pearce your soul Yea if you continue such a course and do not repent you will have cause to<br/>
drink with carefulness &amp; Eat your bread with trembling for your days of prosperity will be few<br/>
Brother Azmon the day is nigh even at your own door when you will know of a truth that these<br/>
sayings are not fables but Eternal truths. the time is at hand when the heavens will be rolled together as<br/>
a scroll and Jesus Christ will be revealed in the clouds of Heaven with his saints to take vengance on<br/>
those who know not God and obey not the Gospel And He will reward evry man according to the deeds<br/>
done in the body.</p>

<p>Brother Azmon I have dealt thus plain with you that I may be clear of your<br/>
Blood and be found acquitted at the [[bar of God|bar of God]]. I think it doubtful whether I meet you short of<br/>
the Eternal world. But I commend you into the hands of Almighty God who doeth all things<br/>
wright. I leave these remarks in your hands to deal with as you see fit. But remember we are<br/>
Accountable to God for all the deeds done in the Body That the Lord will be merciful unto you and deliver<br/>
you from Darkness And Error, give you light and truth &amp; so direct your remaining days as to cause you to<br/>
repent and humble yourself before God that you may again Embrace the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness]] of the [[everlasting gospel|Everlasting Gospel]] &amp; the<br/>
[[new and everlasting covenant|New and everlasting covenant]] that you may escape the Just Judgments of God is the earnest Prayer of you[r]<br/>
Absent Brother.</p>

<p>I would say to all my friends that I desire your welfare and your salvation And<br/>
I intreat you all not to treat lightly or abuse any sacred things or principles which you have in</p>",
42828.0,42,1834-11-05,"<p>your possession or within your reach for the day is at hand that will try many souls. As it respects<br/>
myself I can say the cause I am ingaged in I will never renounce for friend or foe. No by the<br/>
[[grace of God|grace of God]] Assisting me I am determined that neither the powers of Earth or Hell wicked men<br/>
or devils shall ever separate me from the [[new and everlasting covenant|New and Everlasting Covenant]] which God hath<br/>
made in these [[last days|last days]] with his Saints. I to highly prize and value the Blessings embraced<br/>
in this covenant to part with such glorious treasures for any shineing straws that are<br/>
floating down lifes stream. There is virtues in this covenant that will give a man Joy<br/>
when this Earth shakes like chaos and will fill him with Joy <strike>and</strike> felicity and glory at the<br/>
sight of his Lord and Master in the clouds of heaven Yea their souls will be inspired<br/>
with the recollection that they have fought the good fight, that they have finished their<br/>
course and are now prepared to receive there crowns [##2 Timothy 4:7-8##]. Yea I essteem the reproach of<br/>
Christ greater riches than the treasures of the Earth [##Hebrews 11:26##] and I am determin to spend<br/>
my days in the cause even if [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]], [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother]], Brothers, [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Sister]], and all my kindred oppose<br/>
me for in some degree I know the value of the cause in which I am Engage And if God be<br/>
for me who can be against me? [##Romans 8:31##] As Ever I remain your Brother Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>My ordination to the [[Aaronic Priesthood|Aaronic Priesthood]] My first mission to Preach the gospel<br/>
My travels through [[Missouri|Missouri]], [[Arkansas|Arkansas]], and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] Incidents of My Journey</p>

<p>Having embraced the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness]] of the [[everlasting gospel|Everlasting gospel]] of Jesus Christ and seeing in<br/>
it great beauty, power, Glory, and salvation I had a great desire to teach it to my fellow<br/>
men and this desire increased upon me and rested with great wait upon my mind, but<br/>
I did not reveal this to any man. But one sunday evening I retired into the woods alone<br/>
by myself and called upon the Lord in mighty Prayer to open my way to go &amp; Preach the<br/>
gospel of salvation to the children of men, the [[spirit of the Lord|spirit of the Lord]] rested upon me and bore<br/>
witness unto me that my Prayer was heard &amp; should be answered upon my head I arose<br/>
from ^my^ knees happy and walked some 40 rods through a thick wood into an open road<br/>
as I entered the road there stood before me Judge [[Elias Higbee|Elias Higby]] an High Priest with whom<br/>
I had associated daily but he had never passed a word with me about Preaching to my recollection<br/>
but now as I approached him He said ""Brother Wilford the spirit of the Lord tells me that<br/>
you should be ordained and go &amp; preach the gospel.[""] I said vary well if it is the [[will of the Lord|will of the Lord]]<br/>
I am ready. It was a Practice at this time in Zion if anyone was to be ordained to be recom-<br/>
mended by the branc[h] where they lived And at a meeting of the High Council Held at<br/>

<p><u>I Received</u> <u>the following</u> <u>license</u>. <u>To whom</u> <u>these presents</u> <u>may come</u></p>

<p>I called upon Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]] and asked him whare my mission should be in what part of the country<br/>
I should go to preach the gospel. He replyed that He would like to have some of the Brethren go into the Southern States<br/>
through [[Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], [[Kentucky|Kentucky]], &amp;c if he could find any body who had faith Enough to go for it would<br/>
be a hard mission &amp; a hard <strike>mission</strike> country to travel in at present in consequence of the [[Missouri|Missouri]] persecution<br/>
I told him I was as ready to go South as any whare Els if he wished it. As Arkansas lay south of Mo I<br/>
asked him if I should go through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] as that county lay direct in our path. He said it would be<br/>
a risk of ones life but if I had faith to undertake it I might do it He had not. I asked him if I went<br/>
through Jackson County should I start without ""Purs or scrip"" He said he had not faith enough to attempt<br/>
it through Jackson County if I had I might try it. As the commandments required the Elders to travel<br/>
without purse or scrip I felt strenuous to keep the commandments so I resolved to go without purse or scrip<br/>
I wished to have some companion to go with me upon my mission as I did not wish to launch forth into the open world<br/>
alone I called upon Brother [[Henry Brown|Henry Brown]] (who had <strike>gone</strike> accompanied me from [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] N. Y. to M.o.)<br/>

pass through Jackson County &amp; should we be caught by the mob &amp; the petition found with us it might<br/>

the word of truth &amp; give evry man their portion of meat in due season that our garments might<br/>

when He came to his senses he gave us permission to stop with him &amp; lie upon the bare floor as He<br/>
did which we excepted off. He said the cause of his being Frightened was that a few evenings<br/>
before he had shot a large panther which stood in his door &amp; he thought that his mate had lit upon<br/>
him. I asked him for sumthing to Eat as we had travelled 60 miles without Eating He said He had<br/>

into as soon as they get doors open for preaching &amp; the people were ready to receive it they will run away<br/>
&amp; leave them this was the case with us. We had been there 13 days had met with much opposition in<br/>
the begining but the Lord had sent Judgment upon our opposers &amp; there had been more than 20 death in the<br/>
neighborhood during our stay with the people, and our worst opposer had droped dead at my feet, my dream<br/>
had its pe[r]fect fulfillment, prejudice had given way, &amp; the people were Just ready to Embrace the gospel &amp;<br/>
pleading with us to stay and preach to them, which had we have done we certainly should have built up a <br/>
church in that place. I wished to stop &amp; labour with the people as the Lord had opened doors for us, But Br<br/>
Brown would not consent. He was Holding the office of an Elder, I a Priest, And I felt that I must<br/>
be subject to any one over me in office so I had to yield much to the grief of the people &amp; in opposition<br/>
to my own Judgment. We left Brother Hubbel'<sup>s</sup> accompanied by Brother [[Wright Akeman|Wright Akeman]] travelled 23 miles<br/>

a preacher this was the view of Mr [[Josiah Jackson|Jackson]] untill he became highly Excited and was in for<br/>
having some fun. I was pleased to see it take this turn for I desired to preach to the <br/>
people they set a table and gave me a good supper in a large hall. Mr Jackson went out into<br/>
the [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|city]] immediately and gave Notice to a certain class of men and women to come to his hall<br/>
to hear an imposture preach, and before I got through eating the room began to be crouded<br/>
with <strike>a class of</strike> men and women who were dressed in their silks, satins, and Broad cloth and as<br/>
soon as I finished my supper the table <s>w</s>departed over the heads of the people and Mr Jackson<br/>
gave me a chair in the cornor of the room placed a stand before me with a Bible &amp; Hymn<br/>
Book upon it about a dozen men formed a half circle in front of me and I saw by<br/>
the countenances of the people that they expected some sport. I commenced my meeting<br/>
by reading a Hymn I asked the assembly to sing but no one sung I then knelt down<br/>
and prayed the men in front of me all droped upon their knees. When I arose I read<br/>
<strike>and read</strike> the ##Romans 11|11 chapter of Romans## and preached from the ##Romans 11:21|21 <u>vers</u>## ""For if God spared not the<br/>
natural Branches take heed lest he also spare<strike>ed</strike> not thee."" I spent but few moments in talking<br/>
about the Jews But I turned to the assembly before me and as the [[spirit of God|spirit of God]] rested upon<br/>
me and revealed unto me the wickedness of their hearts I poured it out upon them and<br/>
told them of their wickedness whoredoms and abominations in vary plain terms<br/>
I do not suppose they ever had their sins as plainly pointed out to them as on this<br/>
occasion the men who sat in front of me droped their heads in the early part of my<br/>
discourse and I could not <strike>c</strike>ketch their Eye afterwards, when I had tho<strike>o</strike>roughly answered<br/>

in bed but a few moments untill a croud of the men who had attended collected in the room<br/>
Joining me and dicused the subject of my being an impostor and my sermon and they decided<br/>
that I was not an impostor and it puzzled them much to understand how I should know so<br/>
much about their crimes being a stranger to them for I had told them much which they were<br/>
guilty off. They discussed this subject till near midnight when some Negroes came and broke<br/>
open their turkey roost and they all put out after the Negroes and this enabled me to go to<br/>

possession to preserve for [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|his]] [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]] [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] and friends. While looking over<br/>
his letters I found all that I had sent him carefully filed with other<br/>
communications from his family</p>

<p>After attending to the above affairs I accompanied<br/>
by my wife and Mr [[Martin Ray|Ray]], visited my brother's grave. His lot had<br/>
been cast among strongers and among them he fell and found a<br/>
early grave. No friend of his blood <strike>w</strike>or wife shared his grief or<br/>
joy in a family home nor droped with him there a ^co^mingled tear</p>

<p>And now Wilford and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] alone of all his family<br/>
marked his last dwelling place—his silent grave which looked<br/>
to us as we viewed it lonely indeed</p>

<p>I took some pebbles from his grave in memory<br/>
of the spot and ^returned^ with the reflection impressed upon my mind<br/>
that I had paid my last visit to my eldest [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|brother]] without<br/>
spending a night under his roof and now my last visit to my<br/>
younger brother and only permitted to view his grave.</p>

<p>I wrote a letter to our parents in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]<br/>
giving an account of Asahel's death &amp;c and <strike>w</strike>then started nine<br/>
miles farther on my journey the same day.</p>

[[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] Sangamon Co. Illinois on the <time datetime=""",12/19/1838

to say we unexpectedly found [[Ebenezer Waterman Carver|Ebenezar Cart^v^er]] and family<br/>
who left us at [[Utica, Oneida County, New York|Utica]] N. P. [Y] and took the canal and lake.<br/>
They had stoped in Rochester to spend the winter. We called<br/>
to visit them for a few minutes not expecting to tarry; but<br/>
after calling we concluded to spend the night with them. During<br/>
the evening I had an interview with Elder [[Arnold Stephens|Arnold Stephens]].</p>

<p>I was informed that we could not cross the<br/>
[[Illinois River, Illinois|Illinois River]] in consequence of the ice. I also learned that the<br/>
Saints in Zion [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] were suffering the severest persecution and<br/>
privation and that we could not travel through that country.</p>

<p>Under these combined circumstances we concluded<br/>
to stop for a season in the region of Rochester as doors were<br/>
opened to us and that too among Saints who had also taken<br/>
up their abode here for a season</p>

<p>Next day I procured a house 3 miles north of<br/>
Rochester in a grove of woods on the borders of a prairie on the<br/>

<p>On the following day still indisposed in health<br/>
I walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] wrote a letter to ^my brother^ [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]] and<br/>
spent the night with Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] at brother [[John Benbow|Benbow's]]<br/>

my view<strike>s</strike> stretched out many miles. [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] City lies on the<br/>

with several large villages between laid stretch out before me<br/>
with [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]] and other villages in the West and a fine beautiful<br/>
cultivated vale upon every hand</p>

<p>While standing upon the eminance of this<br/>
noted Hill beholding the grand and charming prospect before me<br/>
the thunders began to roll and the lightenings flash beneath<br/>
my feet in the vale below on which the rain descended in<br/>
torrents. The solemnity and granduer of the scene was<br/>

severe affliction since I last saw her and even at this time<br/>

we rode to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] a distance of 4 miles</p>

at the house occupied by [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Father]] and Mother [[Lucy Mack Smith|Smith]] the<br/>
parents of Joseph and also by his brothers [[Samuel Smith|Samuel]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Carlos]]<br/>
and their families.</p>

<p>The street was the next scene and here<br/>
I met on every hand the Saints with whom I had been<br/>
formerly acquainted. There were Petty, [[Randolph Alexander|Alexander]], [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]],<br/>
and their families from the South; and there were [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]], [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], [[John Portineus Greene|J. P. Green]] and most all the other<br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] Saints. Soon brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan Hale]] came<br/>
along with a shovel on his back and gave me a ""How<br/>
do you do brother Woodruff?""</p>

<p>I saw so many old friends that I hardly<br/>
knew who to go home with first. Finally I concluded<br/>
to go home and spend the night with Brother Jonathan</p>

<p>We had an interesting time together in talking <br/>
over our travels upon the Islands of the sea. He also gave<br/>
me an account of the sufferings of himself and family and<br/>
of the sufferings of the Saints in [[Missouri|Missouri]] during the<br/>
past winter.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Missouri had become<br/>
transformed into a State mob with Governor [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Bogg]] at<br/>
their head. They came from time to time upon the<br/>
Saints in battle array. Our people were shot down by<br/>
them like wild beast others were butchered in cold blood<br/>
and some had their brains knocked out after they were taken<br/>
prisoners. The soldiers also shot down the cattle cows<br/>
and hogs of the Saints for the mere purpose of destroying<br/>
them.</p>

which many Elders have fallen into. As soon as doors have<br/>
been opened to them for the [[preach the gospel|preaching of the Gospel]] and<br/>
the people have been ready to receive it they have removed<br/>
and left them. This was the case with us. We had<br/>
been there thirteen days and had met with much opposi-<br/>
tion in the beginning; but the Lord had sent judge-<br/>
ments upon our opposers; during our stay there had<br/>
been more than twenty deaths in the neighborhood;<br/>
our worst [[Alexander Akeman|enemy]] had falled dead at my feet; my<br/>
dream had received its perfect fulfilment; prejudice<br/>
had given way and the people were ready to receive the<br/>
Gospel. Indeed they pleaded with us to stay, which had<br/>
we done we certainly should have built up a branch of<br/>
the Church in that place. I desired to tarry and labour<br/>
with this people as the Lord had opened doors for us; but<br/>
brother Brown would not consent and as he was an<br/>
Elder and I but a Priest I yielded much to the grief<br/>
of the people and in opposition to my own judgment.<br/>

the mud and water but I had not gone far before I was taken with<br/>
such rheumatic pains in one of my knees that I could not travel<strike>l</strike><br/>
My companion, Elder [[Henry Brown|Brown]] was very anxious to make a speedy<br/>
journey to the river take a steamer up the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]] and hasten<br/>
to his friends in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. He therefore thought we had better<br/>
seperate as he could travel faster than I in my lame condition</p>

<p>I did not object to Elder Brown's proposition although I thought<br/>
that <u>I</u> should not have been willing to leave a lone companion in <br/>
the ministry in an open swamp without knowing whether he would<br/>
be able to walk far enough to meet again any companion more<br/>
acceptable than the wolves bears and alagators with which I was<br/>
surrounded</p>

<p>My fellow traveller left me sitting upon a log in the mud and<br/>
water without any food and twelve<strike>s</strike> miles to the nearest house on my<br/>
road. I gazed upon him as he hastened out of my sight, then<br/>
knelt down in the mud and water and prayed unto the Lord in the<br/>
name of Jesus Christ in faith that he would heal me and open my<br/>
way that I might continue on my journey. The Lord heard my<br/>
prayer: His Spirit descended upon me and I was healed. I arose,<br/>
went on my way rejoicing, and, after walking fourteen miles was<br/>
kindly received by Mr [[John Casber|John Cas<strike>p</strike>ber]]. At this place there was quite<br/>
a settlement and the people came together and filled the house.<br/>
I preached to them and bore a strong testimony of the [[work of God|work of<br/>

three miles upon me during the day; and in travelling those<br/>

<p>A Feast Day With the Saints.</p>

<p>The 10th of May was an interesting day to me and<br/>
and my brethren who had come on the Lord's business from<br/>
our native land to establish the first ^<span class=""unclear"">[forein]</span>^ mission of the<br/>
Church in the nations of Europe. It had been a custom<br/>
of the United Brethren to hold ^the meeting^.</p>

<p>But they were now members of the Church of Latter<br/>
Day Saints and had received the fulness of the Gospel<br/>
and as such they continued their old custom by brotherhood<br/>
Accordingly Brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] formerly the presiding<br/>
minister and Superintendent of the Church of United<br/>
Brethren and now their Presiding Elder as a part of the<br/>
Church of Latter-day Saints on this day once more prepared<br/>
a temporal feast for his flock.</p>

<p>The day began to us propitious<br/>
At five o clock in the morning I met some friends at<br/>
Mr [[Joseph Hill|Joseph Hill's]] at [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] and baptized three persons,<br/>
two of whom were Churchmen and the other a Wesleyan<br/>
from thence we walked to [[William Hart|William Hart's]]</p>

<p>Elder Kington baptized seven<br/>
and Elders Brigham Young and Willard Richards<br/>
confirmed them. In a few minutes I baptized five<br/>
more who were confirmed as they came out of the water<br/>
We then returned to brother Kingtons and as we were<br/>
on the road we met another person, a woman who <br/>
also desired to be baptized. Elder Kington baptized</p>",

to the quorum of the Twelve to fill the place of those who<br/>
had fallen. We had been previously nominated by the First<br/>

[[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi River]] crossed the ferry and walked into the<br/>
city of [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]] a stranger and alone—weary hungry and<br/>
without money—my clothing rough dirty and nearly<br/>
ragged, having walked through so much swamp water<br/>
and brush. But in this situation I called at one of the<br/>
most respestable taverns in the city kept by a Mr [[Josiah Jackson|Jackson]]<br/>
between whom and myself the following dialogue took<br/>
place:</p>

<p><u>Myself</u>: Sir I am a servant of God—a preacher of the ^Gospel^<br/>
and without purse or scrip—Will you entertain<br/>
me for the night?</p>

<p><u>Jackson</u>: How do I know sir but what you are an impostor?<br/>
You don't look much like a preacher. What<br/>
denomination are you of?</p>

<p><u>Myself</u>: I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ<br/>
of Latter-day Saints. It is true you do not<br/>
know but that I am an impostor; but I can<br/>
show you my licence and recomendation.</p>

<p><u>Jackson</u>: How do I know but you forged them?</p>

<p><u>Myself</u>: You do not and if you are not willing to take<br/>
my word for it I will go my way and try elsewhere.</p>

<p><u>Jackson</u>: No sir y[ou] cannot go. Give me your valise. I<br/>
will keep you for the night and get you a<br/>
congregation and you must preach to us in<br/>
order to prove whether you are an impostor<br/>
or not.""</p>

<p>By this time I found that Mr Jackson really beleived that<br/>
I was an impostor. I was alone yet must confess that I<br/>
felt somewhat mischevious. I feigned to appear as though<br/>
I was frightened and not wish to be put to the test: at which<br/>
Mr J. grew excited and I saw that he was in for fun. It</p>",

we had nearly one hundred Saints together to the feast prepared<br/>
for them. We had indeed that day a most interesting<br/>
and spiritual time as well as <strike>our</strike> social communion<br/>
in temporal things. Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] first addressed<br/>
the Saints and was clothed with the Spirit and power of<br/>
God. He then asked a blessing upon the food so<br/>
bountifully prepared. We then sat down to the table<br/>
and eat and drank with nearly one hundred Saints<br/>
who possessed glad hearts and cheerful countenances<br/>
Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]] remarked that he did not beleive that<br/>
there had ever been such a company of Saints prepared<br/>
in so short a time and who bid fairer for the <br/>
Kingdom of Heaven then the company then assembled<br/>
at least since the Church of Latter-Day Saints was<br/>
first organized.</p>

<p><b>A Church of Four Hundred<br/>
Raised up By Me<br/>
In Two Months &amp; a Half</b></p>

<p>I trurly felt grateful to my Heavenly Father when<br/>
I reflected back upon the time when I first proclamed<br/>
the fulness of the Gospel in this region, and began<br/>
to baptize such as received my testimony. Only two<br/>
months and a half a go since I came into the [[Herefordshire Beacon, Herefordshire, England|Hertfordshire]]<br/>
field of labour and now there was a Church raised ^up^ of nearly<br/>
four hundred souls and the prospect of the work constantly<br/>
increasing.</p>

<p>After our feasting was over the<br/>
house was called to order by Elder Brigham ^Young^ who then<br/>
delivered a short address after which three were confirmed<br/>
by myself and Elder Willard Richards. There were also<br/>
ordained to the office of Elder [[Daniel Browett|Daniel Browett]] and to<br/>
the office of Priest [[John Sivel Smith|John Smith]] [[John Davis|John Davis]] [[James George Morgan|James Morgan]]<br/>

after us to the office of Seventies. We were ordained on the Chief<br/>

[[John Edward Page|John E Page]], [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] Wilford Woodruff<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]].</p>

<p>After this we sung <span class=""unclear"">[A]</span> [blank]</p>

<p><u><i>Fulfilment of the Revelation</i></u></p>

<p>The Twelve then took the parting hand of the following <br/>
Saints agreeable to revelation:</p>

<p>The Master Mason of the House Alpheus<br/>
Cutler then placed the stone before spoken of in its regular<br/>
position. After which in consequence of the peculiar situation<br/>
of the Saints he thought it wisdom to adjourn the work until<br/>
some future time when the Lord should open the way to proce<s>d</s>ed<br/>
with the building.</p>

<p>We had entered into a covenant to see the<br/>
poor Saints all moved out of [[Missouri|Missouri]] into [[Illinois|Illinois]] and we had<br/>
spared no means to accomplish this object and the Lord<br/>
had now given us the desires of our hearts in this thing</p>

<p>The last comapny of the poor who could be<br/>
moved were with us in our return from [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]]. [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P.<br/>

under the necessity of leaving them for a season.</p>

commenced our journey from the Grove in upper Missouri where<br/>
we had returned and camped the night before. This was<br/>
32 miles from the city of Far West.</p>

Twelve, a number of the committee, and several other familes</p>",
42828.0,67,,"<p>suited my purpose for matters to take this turn for I was desirous to preach<br/>
to the people.</p>

<p>They sat me a table in a large hall and gave me a good supper<br/>
<strike>and large</strike> Mr [[Josiah Jackson|Jackson]] went into the town immediately and gave notice<br/>
to a certain class to come to his house and hear an impostor<br/>
preach and before I had finished my supper the room began<br/>
to be crowded with men in broad-cloth and ladies in silks<br/>
and satins.</p>

<p>As soon as I had done my meal the table departed<br/>
over <s>my</s>the heads of the people. My host gave me a chair in<br/>
the corner of the room and placed a stand before me with<br/>
a Bible and a hymn-book upon it. About a dozen of the<br/>
company formed a circle in front of me; and I saw by the<br/>
countenances of the people that they expected some fun.</p>

<p>Commencing my meeting by reading a hymn I asked the<br/>
congregation to sing; but no one sang. I then knelt down and<br/>
prayed and the men in front of me all droped upon their knees.<br/>
When I arose I read the ##Romans 11|11th ch. of Romans## and preached from<br/>
the ##Romans 11:21|21st## verse: ""For if God spared not the natural branches,<br/>
take heed lest he also spare not thee""</p>

<p>I spent but a very few minutes in discourse about the<br/>
Jews but turned to the assembly before me and as the [[spirit of God|Spirit<br/>
of God]] rested upon me and revealed to my understanding the<br/>
wickedness of their hearts I poured it out upon them telling<br/>
them of their wickedness whoredoms and abominations in very<br/>
plain terms. I suppose they never had their sins so plainly<br/>
pointed out before. The men in front of me dropped their<br/>
heads in the early part of my discourse and I could not catch<br/>
their eyes afterwards. Having thoroughly satisfied my mind<br/>
and spoken about an hour and an half I closed the meeting<br/>
and not a word was spoken by any one. The room was instantly<br/>
cleared. In two minutes I was left alone and soon after the<br/>
landlady came in and lit me to bed.</p>

<p>I had not been in bed more than an hour before a crowd<br/>
of men who had attended the meeting collected in a room adjoining<br/>
mine and discussed the subject of my being an impostor or not<br/>
and also my sermon. Their decision was that I was not an<br/>
impostor and it puzzled them much to understand how I should<br/>
know so fully of their sins for I had told them much of which<br/>
they were guilty. The subject was discussed until near midnight</p>",
42828.0,207,,"<p>After our meeting was closed three more were baptized<br/>
The ordinance of baptism was administered by Priest<br/>
[[James George Morgan|James Morgan]] who was baptized confirmed and ordained<br/>
on that ^day^ and now officiated in one of the ordinances of<br/>
the Church. There was baptized and confirmed in all<br/>

<p>On the following day Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
and myself went to [[Keysend Street, Berrow, Worcestershire, England|Keysend Street]] where brother Young<br/>
preached and after the meeting I baptized four who were<br/>
confirmed by Elders Young and Richards as they came out<br/>
of the water.</p>

<p>May the 20th we walked to [[Wind Point, Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Wind Point]] and<br/>
brothers Young Richards and myself went on to the top of that<br/>
part of [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]] called [[Herefordshire Beacon, Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire Beacon]]. Here we <br/>
united in prayer</p>

<p><b>And Held A Council.</b></p>

<p>We jointly felt that it was the will of God that Elder Brigham<br/>
Young should immediately go to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] to assist<br/>
in publishing a</p>

<p><b>Collection of Hymn^s^ <strike>Books</strike><br/>
Of 3000 Copies.</b></p>

<p>and also to immediately print and publish</p>

<p><b>Three Thousand Copies of the Book of Mormon</b></p>

<p>for we had procured three hundred pounds for this purpose<br/>
^donated from [[John Benbow|John Benbow]]^ and was anxious to have this book of God circulated<br/>
and the knowledge of the great work connected with its coming<br/>
forth published to all nations.</p>

<p>Returning to the Vale from the Hill we<br/>
took the parting hand of Brigham Young who star<strike>d</strike>ted for<br/>
Manchester while Elder Richards and myself tarried and<br/>
preached at Wind Point; he baptized two and confirmed <br/>
one and I the other. I also ordained [[John Hallard|John Allard]] to the office<br/>

of visiting [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]</p>

<p><u><i>The Prophet out of Prison</i></u></p>

<p>Myself and five others of the Twelve rode<br/>
four miles out of town to Mr [[John Cleveland|Cleaveland's]] to see brother<br/>
Joseph. He had just been delivered from [[Liberty Jail, Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|prison]]<br/>
and from the hands of his enemies and had returned<br/>
to the bosom of his family and friends. His brother<br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and two others of the brethren<br/>
who had been imprisoned with him had also just<br/>
received their deliverence with him. They had been<br/>
confined in prison about six months and had been<br/>
under sentence of death three times. But their lives<br/>
were in the [[hand of God|hand<strike>s</strike> of God]] and could not be taken by<br/>
their enemies.</p>

<p>They were now at home and we were in<br/>
their midst—all rejoicing together. Joseph was frank open<br/>
and familiar as usual &amp; sister [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma]] was truly happy.<br/>
The Bishops of the Church were also present</p>

<p>Two years had rolled away since I had<br/>
seen the Prophet Joseph's face and absense had served<br/>
to strengthen the strong union that made us one in the<br/>
[[new and everlasting covenant|New and Everlasting Covenant]]. When we arrived he greeted<br/>
us with joy and after spending the day rejoicing together<br/>

kindness and entertainment. He said I was welcome and<br/>
that if ever I came that way again he wished me to call<br/>

me if we beleived in music and dancing. He was an<br/>

We then walked to brother [[Thomas Jenkins|Jinkins]] at [[Moorends Cross, Malton, Worcestershire, England|Moorend's Cross]]<br/>
where we spent that night and the next day and blessed<br/>
the family of our worthy brother and host.</p>

<p>Sunday the 24th I walked to [[Old Storridge Common, Alfrick, Worcestershire, England|Old<br/>
Starridge Common]] to attend a Camp Meeting. I preached<br/>
in the morning and brother Willard Richards in the<br/>
evening after which we broke bread with the Saints<br/>
Three were baptized by me and we ordained three<br/>
Priests and one teacher.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in looking<br/>
up the aged and infirm and we baptized as many<br/>
as would receive our testimony. I baptized six and<br/>
brother Richards confirmed them one of whom was<br/>
eighty years of age. We also preached at [[Dunns Close, Herefordshire, England|Dunn's Closs]]<br/>
and the next day at [[Bishops Frome, Herefordshire, England|Bishops Froome]]</p>

<p>The 27th we baptized [[Charlotte Hannah Pulling|Charlotte Pullin]]<br/>
who had been a cripple from her birth and she received<br/>
a blessing after which we walked to [[Stokes Lane, Herefordshire, England|Stokes Lane]] and<br/>
preached, confirmed ten persons into the church and<br/>
ordained two Priests and one Teacher and on the <br/>
20th I baptized 4 at [[Creeks Green, Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, England|Cricks Green]] who were confirmed</p>",

continued through the next day which was <time datetime=""",05/05/1839
42828.0,161,1839-05-06,""">Sunday</time>. At its close<br/>
a collection was taken up for the poor.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",05/06/1839
42828.0,161,,""">6th of May</time> I met with the Quorum of<br/>
the Seventies and after some counselling there were sixty ordained into<br/>
the seventies.</p>

<p>After this I with the Twelve and Bishops met<br/>
brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] at the house of Bishoph [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] where we again<br/>
had an interesting time. This ended the Conference.</p>

<p>Several brethren who attended this conference<br/>
had been wounded by the Missourian mob. I will here<br/>
relate<br/>
<u><b>A Remarkable Incident of the Persecution</b></u></p>

<p>Brother [[Isaac Laney|Isaac Leany]] was in company with about<br/>
20 others at <b>[[Haun|Hawn's Mills]]</b> in upper [[Missouri|Missouri]] when a large<br/>
armed mob fell upon them with loaded rifles and other<br/>
weapons and shot down seventeen of the Saints and murdered<br/>
them in cold blood.</p>

<p>Brother Leany fled from the scene for life and<br/>
while fleeing the mob poured forth a shower of balls upon him<br/>
which pierced his body through and through. He showed<br/>
me eleven holes in his body and there w<s>as</s>ere 27 in his shirt<br/>
7 in his pantaloons and his coat was literally cut to rags.<br/>
One ball entered his body at one arm pit and came out at<br/>
the other; another ball entered the back and came out of the<br/>
breast and balls passed through each hip each leg and each<br/>
arm. All th<s>i</s>ese w<s>as</s>ere received while runing for life.</p>

<p>Strange in fact miraculous as it was all these<br/>
wounds with the addition of a broken rib from one of the balls <br/>
yet the speed of this brother was not lessened but he entirely<br/>
out-run his pursuers and saved his life.</p>

<p>This is as remarkable a case as ever recorded in<br/>
history of a man being literally riddled with balls besides having<br/>
his clothes almost cut to rags on his back with the shower of<br/>
lead and yet to outrun his pursuers and save his life just as<br/>
though only a few pees had been showered after him. He <br/>
was at this Conference now; and we can only acknowledge his<br/>
miraculous preservation to be by the [[power of God|power]] and mercy of God.</p>",
42828.0,69,1835-06-28,"<p>Elders [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]] and [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] had arrived<br/>
a short time before and had baptized over twenty persons in this<br/>
region. I was truly rejoiced to meet any of the Saints as I had<br/>
travelled several hundred miles alone; and I felt it a happy<br/>
privilege when after walking five miles next day I met Elder<br/>
Warren Parrish</p>

<p>Elder Parrish was travelling and preaching almost daily<br/>
baptizing such as would receive his testimony. He wished me<br/>
to join him in his ministerial labors and I did so; and we<br/>
labored together during a period of about three months travelling from<br/>
place to place and preaching nearly every day. We held several debates<br/>
[[administer to the sick|administered to the sick]] and baptized twenty-six up to the date<br/>
of the <time datetime=""",06/28/1835
42828.0,69,1835-06-23,""">28th of June</time>. In this interval I also wrote two letters to<br/>
the Saints in Zion, one to [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] and one to my parents.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",06/23/1835
42828.0,69,,""">23rd of June</time> we received a letter from [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver<br/>
Cowdery]] containing a request for Elder Parrish to return to<br/>
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] as he was one of the Seventies chosen. He also<br/>
stated that it was wisdom for me to remain in the South and<br/>
to take charge of the Churches which we had raised up. I<br/>
was instructed to labor in great humility and told that I<br/>
should lose nothing as there were other Seventies to be chosen<br/>
and that I should be remembered.</p>

<p>My Autobiography is not about to branch into my ordination<br/>
to the office of Elder and to take in an account of my labors<br/>
while holding that office. I will therefore close this chapter by<br/>
subjoining the following synopsis:</p>

<p><u><b>Synopsis of My Travels, Etc.</b></u></p>

42828.0,209,,"<p>by Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]]. We then walked to [[Hope|Hope Rush]] and preached<br/>
when I baptized five more who were also confirmed by<br/>
brother Richards</p>

<p>On this day we visited the greatest curiosity<br/>
of Evergreen known in [[Europe|Europe]] or in any part of the world<br/>
so far as I can learn. This Evergreen was upon the farm<br/>
known as hopton in the Hole in the Parish of [[Much Cowarne, Herefordshire, England|Much Cowen<br/>
Herefordshire]] and owned by [[Richard Gardner|Richard Gardner]]. It was in a<br/>
circular form inclosing about one acre composed of Yew trees<br/>
growing out and standing in the midst of a border of Box<br/>
<strike>B</strike>brush. The yew trees were about in the form of a high<br/>
and well built hay or wheat stack and were suposed to be<br/>
several hundred years old. This Evergreen was surrounded by<br/>
a canal of water.</p>

<p>Our labours of the following day commenced<br/>
with my baptizing two at the creek who were confirmed by<br/>
Elder Richards and then we walked to [[Shucknall Hill, Herefordshire, England|Sucknell Hill]] and<br/>
preached after which I baptized three more one of whom was<br/>
a preacher and ordained one Priest</p>

<p>Next day Elder Richards baptized two<br/>
whom I confirmed and then we walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]]<br/>
to spend the night at brother [[John Benbow|Benbow's]]. Elder Richards<br/>
and myself had retired to rest for the night when brother<br/>
[[John Fidoe|John Fidoe]] came in and brought us six letters three of which<br/>
were for myself. One of these were from [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]<br/>
[[Georgetown, Essex County, Massachusetts|George Town]] Massachusetts and another from my wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]<br/>
[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] Lee Co. Iowa. This was the first letter which I<br/>
had received from my wife since my arrival in [[England|England]]<br/>
Her letter contained much interesting news to me. She<br/>
informed me of</p>

He also fled and though the balls fell around him like hail<br/>
stones yet was he delivered also.<br/>

42828.0,70,,"<p>Meetings Held:</p>

<p>In [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] I held 14 meetings, and in [[Tennessee|Tennnesee]] and<br/>

<p>Introductory Remarks.</p>

<p>In continuing th<strike>y</strike>e embodiment of my Journals in the form<br/>
of history I do not design to make it a mere diary. In<br/>
describing my journey and the incidents thereof I followed<br/>
a consecutive daily detail and shall adopt the same form<br/>
at times hereafter when it appears most suitable but as in<br/>
general one days record must be very similar to those<br/>
of many days so as a general rule I shall not follow a<br/>
diary form. My journals will show that as a rule<br/>
every day was spent in the active performance of<br/>
ministerial duties in daily travels and daily preaching<br/>
from place to place. I shall only note in this history<br/>
that which contains some leading incident or which has<br/>
a variation worthy of notice.</p>",

<p>Another of the letters was from Sister [[Jennetta Richards Richards|Richards]] and one<br/>
also from Elder [[James Whitehead|Whitehead]] and there was so much glorious <br/>
news that sleep was driven from our eyes for the night. I <br/>
felt more like shouting Hallelujah.</p>

<p>According to appointment Sunday the<br/>
31<sup>st</sup> of May we attended a Camp Meeting at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]]<br/>
when I preached in the morning on the authenticity of<br/>
the Book of Mormon after which we went to the pool<br/>
where I baptized 12 and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] confirmed<br/>
them at the water's side. Elder Richards preached in the <br/>
afternoon <strike>when</strike> when we administered bread and wine to <br/>
the Saints and then about one hundred of us went to<br/>
the water <strike>when</strike> ^where^ two more were baptized by Elder [[John Cheese|Cheese]].<br/>
Two of those baptized this day were preachers.</p>

and one baptized by Bro [[John Spiers|Spires]].</p>

<p>The next day I walked to [[Deerhurst, Gloucestershire, England|Deerhurst]] and preached<br/>
and at night I dreamed I saw a large Church on fire. The steple<br/>
which was high was in flames. Several men were in the belfry<br/>
trying to save some part of the building with ropes pullies and <br/>
chains but they were soon obliged to flee for their lives and <br/>
much of the surrounding country was on fire. I dreamt that<br/>
I was on a large horse and rode out of the way.</p>

[[Nathan Roberts|Nathan Roberts]]. I sung a hymn and prayed before the body<br/>
was conveyed to the grave. I bless^ed^ the children of the widow<br/>

confirmed them blessed eleven children and laid hands on<br/>
four for the healing of the sick Afterwards I walked from<br/>
Deerhurst to [[Apperley, Gloucestershire, England|Apperly]] and preached and on the next two<br/>
days preached at several places and baptized one and blessed a <br/>
number of children.</p>

<p>June 12th I walked to [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] and<br/>
had an interview with Elder Richards who had just returned<br/>
from the south part of [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]. He had built up a<br/>
church of eleven members and ordained one Teacher among<br/>
them. We preached at brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington's]] confirmed 2 and healed<br/>
one who was sick. Elder Richards wrote an article for the<br/>
Millennial Star.</p>

at the evening at his house from the ##Psalm 50:3-5|L Psalm—3, 4, and 5## verses.<br/>
At the close of the meeting I opened the door for baptism<br/>
when eight came forward and gave me their hands, all<br/>
of whom were Campbellites except one and he was a<br/>
baptist. We repared to the water and the [[spirit of the Lord|Spirit of the<br/>

council of the Priesthood should be held alternately on the<br/>
south and North sides of the [[River Severn, England|River Severn]] to commence at<br/>
[[Leigh, Gloucestershire, England|Leigh]] on the 26th of June and organized the same by appointing<br/>
Elder Daniel Browett President and [[John Hill|John Hill]] clerk of these<br/>

North side was ^also^ organized by the appointment of Elder<br/>
[[William Jenkins, b. 1818|William Jinkins]] President and John Smith clerk: the<br/>
first council to assemble on the 9th of the next July at<br/>

light and offers him his hand and the man when he essays to<br/>
take hold of the proffered hand feels nothing nor senses any substance<br/>
he may know that this is the Devil; for when a Saint whose<br/>
body is not resurrected appears unto a man in the flesh he will<br/>
not offer his hand for this would be against the law given<br/>

be enabled to detect the Devil that he deceive us not.</p>

light nor road but was in darkness rain mud and tree-tops<br/>
We crossed the stream about 20 times and had [it] not been for<br/>
our horses and the females in our company we should have<br/>
appeared far more like fishermen than travellers. I thought<br/>
of [[Paul (NT)|Paul's]] perils by water. [##Acts 27##] But the Lord was merciful to<br/>
us; for while we were in the wood groping as the blind<br/>
for the wall, suffering under the blast of wind and rain,<br/>
a light suddenly shone around about us without aid either<br/>
of the sun moon or stars and it revealed to us that we<br/>
were in danger of killing both ourselves and animals by<br/>
riding off steep bluffs. We were on the edge of a deep gulf when<br/>
the light appeared which continued with us until we found<br/>
a house and were put on the right road. The light then<br/>
disappeared and the darkness returned: yet we reached the<br/>
house of brother [[Henry Thomas Jr.|Henry Thomas]] at 9 o'clock in the evening<br/>
without having received any hurt either to ourselves or horses.<br/>
We were five hours in the storm and had ridden twenty<br/>
miles and crossed creeks about as many times as the miles<br/>
we had travelled. All were impressed with the care<br/>
of Providence towards and we felt to return the Lord thanks<br/>
for our preservation and his blessings so signally marked<br/>
in our history of that day. This surely deserves notice<br/>
as one of the episodes of my life and an instance of<br/>
deliverance from the Lord in a time of need.</p>

East and the third in the North, each appearing about the<br/>
size of an acre of ground. They arose from the horizon<br/>
to the zenith and frequently changed their position. This <br/>
was November the 17th. On this day also I had baptized<br/>

[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] spoke from the text ""If the Lord be God<br/>
serve Him."" The power of the Priesthood rested upon him<br/>
and the principles of eternal truth were presented so plain that no<br/>
opposing power could ^with^stand them. After he closed I arose and<br/>
bore my testimony to what the congregation had heard</p>

<p>The church minister of the parish had<br/>
sent ^his curdle^ a spy to our meeting to carry him word concerning<br/>
what was preached. As soon as the meeting closed<br/>
I put my hand upon his shoulder and asked him<br/>
what he thought of our doctrine and he replied ""I<br/>
think it is of God."" He appeared astonished when<br/>
he left the house. Almost every person with whom<br/>
I conversed said that they wished to be baptized<br/>
as soon as an opportunity offered. Several were<br/>
baptized by Elder [[Philip Green|Green]] after their return home<br/>
and one after the meeting by Priest [[Benjamin Williams|Williams]].</p>

<p>We had baptized on this day<br/>
six persons and confirmed them ordained two Priests<br/>

<p>On the morning of the following<br/>

to be baptized</p>

<p>We immediately walked to the [[River Lugg, Herefordshire, England|River<br/>
Lug]] but being hindered for a short time in looking <br/>
for a place suitable for the purpose a man by the<br/>
name of Pitt ^came^ up to us filled with the devil and at<br/>
the head of a mob and commanded us not to<br/>
baptize in that river and threatened us much if we<br/>
did so. Elder Richards preached to him and warned<br/>
him to repent but the Devil raged so much in him<br/>
and his company that we deemed it wise to postpone<br/>
the administration of the ordinance</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] then arose and gave to us some<br/>
of the precious things of the Kingdom in the power of the [[Holy Ghost|Holy<br/>

the following synopsis of<br/>
<b><u>Joseph's Charge to the Twelve!!</u></b></p>

<p>""Ever keep in exercise the principles of mercy<br/>
and be ready to forgive your broth<s>er</s>ren on the first signs<br/>
of repentance and his asking forgiveness; and should we<br/>
even forgive our brother or our enemy before he ask it our<br/>
[[Heavenly Father|Heavenly Father]] will he equally as merciful unto us. We<br/>
ought also to be willing to confess all our sins and keep<br/>
nothing back.</p>

<p>Let the Twelve be humble and not be<br/>
exaulted and beware of pride. Seek not to exalt yourselves<br/>
one above another nor to excel one another but act for <br/>
each other's good. We should honorably make mention of<br/>
each other's name in our prayers before the Lord and before<br/>
our fellow men and not backbite and devour our brother.</p>

<p>Why will not man learn wisdom from<br/>
precept and example? Why at this late age of the world<br/>
must we be obliged to learn everything we know by sad<br/>
experience?</p>

<p>Must the new ones who are chosen to fill<br/>
the places of those who are fallen of the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
begin to exalt themselves until they get so high as to tumble<br/>
over and have a great fall? Must they do so and afterwards<br/>
go wallowing through the mire and be left in darkness &amp; [[Judas (NT)|Judas]]<br/>
like be delivered to the buffatings of Satan as several of the<br/>

<p>Reflections of the Year.</p>

<p>""The <strike>acco</strike>before mentioned is an account of my proceedings of<br/>
the year 1835, which has borne to heaven its report of me<br/>
and of all men. Could the year not have borne more<br/>
welcome news? Ah! but it cannot be recalled. The sable<br/>
shades of night already speak<strike>s</strike> the departure of 1835 and the<br/>
queen of night is showing forth her silver light to welcome the<br/>
dawn of 1836 which approaches us in calm to go out in a<br/>
storm! O momentous and important year which will hurl<br/>
thy millions to the tomb, shake kingdoms and bespeak a<br/>
God in Israel! When the Lord speaks who can but prophesy!<br/>
O God enable my heart and hands to be clean for a year<br/>
to come!""</p>

<p>Thus ends the year 1835 and the eighth chapter<br/>
of my history commences with a new year to me even<br/>
more eventful than the one here closed.</p>

was an important day in my history. In company of<br/>
two of the Twelve and about one hundred Saints I and<br/>
Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] crossed in the ferry boat from [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] to<br/>
[[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] to attend meeting that the Twelve might deliver their<br/>
farewell address before they left for [[England|England]]</p>

<p>When we arrived at the place of meeting<br/>
Elder [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] was speaking. He occupied the stand<br/>
in the fore-part of the day and spoke much of the proof of<br/>
the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]].</p>

<p>In the afternoon brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] spoke <br/>
I followed and afterwards [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] then addressed us with remarks peculiarly<br/>
adapted to the circumstances of the Twelve taking their<br/>
departure from all they held dear on earth to go to other<br/>
nations to bear the testimony of God's work and revelation of<br/>
the [[last days|last days]]. His appeal to our affections was <strike>so</strike> powerful<br/>
touching our parting from our wives and children the<br/>
trying circumstances that surrounded our families the perils<br/>
that we might meet and the blessings we should receive &amp;c.<br/>
Tears were brought from many an eye while he addressed us</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] then spoke to us a few words<br/>
and said, ""Remember brethren, if you are imprisoned brother<br/>
Joseph has been imprisoned before you; if you are<br/>
placed where you can <strike>only</strike> see your brethren only through<br/>
the grates of a window while in irons because of the Gospel<br/>
of Jesus Christ, remember brother Joseph has been in like<br/>
circumstances.""</p>

<p>After this manner were his remarks<br/>
and then the meeting closed and three were baptised.</p>

<p>The third day after this I spent with<br/>
Joseph and some of the Twelve in arranging a selection of<br/>
hymns for the Church and two days later I assissted John<br/>
Taylor in looking over the proof shee[t] of the first Number of <br/>
the ""[[Times and Seasons|Times and Seasons]]""</p>

the Presidency and also Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]. We also [[priesthood blessing|administered]]<br/>

of an interview with Elder [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] who had been with Elder Patten<br/>
and his [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|wife]] for several days. He related the glorious news communicated<br/>
to him and gave an account of the endowments at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] Ohio<br/>
relating that the Heavens were opened and angels were seen and<br/>
Jesus sitting on the right hand of the Father. I was farther told<br/>
that Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] one of the [[First Quorum of the Seventy|first Seventy]] and some others<br/>
of the first Elders were expected to visit us and that there was<br/>
also a Se<strike>vent</strike>cond Seventy chosen and that I was one of them. Two <br/>

the Presidency of the Church at Kirtland. There were<br/>
glorious things pronounced upon my head by the [[spirit of prophecy|Spirit of<br/>

strive to take my life but that God would deliver me out of<br/>
their hands; that the Lord would give me the desire of my<br/>

a wagon with brother Perkins 25 miles to bro. [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Carlos Smith's]].<br/>

Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] followed me. We had travelled forty miles<br/>

member of our Church. I was much fatigued and had fever</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my fatigue and fever I<br/>
had an interview during the evening with a Mr Adams who<br/>
had been a constant companion of my brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] for several<br/>
years.</p>

<p>Mr Adams spoke highly of my brother and<br/>
of the strictness of his principles. He said Asahel got along well in<br/>
his business until the last year of his life. He bought a large<br/>
quantity of books and they did not sell as well as he expected<br/>
and he was in consequnce not able to meet all his engagements<br/>
This was a source of much regret to him and the main<br/>
cause of his estate becoming insolvent</p>

<p>During the last year of his life he manifested<br/>
a greater desire than ever to improve his mind. He read<br/>
many of [[Thomas Paine|Tom. Paine's]] works and they tended more fully to<br/>
establish him in the Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed through<br/>
the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] in the last days. As<strike>h</strike>ahel considered<br/>
Paine's writings easy to be refuted</p>

her very sick and we concluded that she had been poisoned. I rode her to<br/>
the meeting and preached and thence fo<strike>h</strike>ur miles which was the last any<br/>
person ever rode her. The next day after much suffering she died. I opened<br/>
her and became convinced that she was poisoned which indeed was also<br/>
acknowledged by one who knew the fact. Elder [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot's]] horse also met<br/>
the same fate being poisoned by wicked men who very likely would not<br/>
have hesitated much in administering a similar potion to us. Thus<br/>
ended the life of poor Jude who had carried me thousands of miles and<br/>
had carried others also on the same errand—to preach the Gospel. This left<br/>
me to travel on foot.</p>

driven from [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], Ten., by a lawless mob on an account of<br/>
their religion. Himself and brother [[Warren Farr Parrish|Parrish]] had both been hunted from<br/>
place to place by the ungodly rabble until Elder Parrish had left<br/>

<p>Marvellous indeed had been the work of God in<br/>
the [[Hereford, Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] mission. Less than four months since<br/>
the Gospel was first preached in this region of country—<br/>

<p>Just as we were about to leave Frooms Hill on<br/>

The ordinance was administered to them by myself and<br/>

was more capable of judging his views and feelings upon<br/>
spiritual subjects. He informed me that his mind was<br/>
deeply engaged with the faith of the Latter-day Saints</p>

<p>At first my brother said but little about the<br/>
subject but before his death he warmly contended for the principles<br/>
and defended the cause of the Latter-day Saints when it was<br/>
assailed.</p>

<p>[[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] was not himself during the last few<br/>
months of his life but was absent minded and overwhelmed in<br/>
deep study and would be lost in thought for hours together<br/>
He lost his former cheerfulness and during those last months<br/>
he spoke more frequently of his friends than before and<br/>
especially of myself. He was making preparations to go east<br/>
and was only hindered by his sickness and death.</p>

<p>Mr Adams confirmed the statement that<br/>
my brother's loss was much regreted by all of his acquaintances<br/>
and said that Asahel maintained that the cause of the Latter-<br/>
day Saints was worthy of a thorough investigation and<br/>
ought to be carefully searched into.</p>

it seemed that he would die. We were obliged to stop<br/>

unto the Lord to bless Parson Baity and his household and we<br/>
covenanted together not to leave his house until he became a<br/>
Latter-day Saint. We returned to his house, preached the Gospel<br/>

bered in consequence of the prospect of the fulfilment of the words<br/>
of the ancient Prophets who testify of the great events of the last<br/>
days especially the gathering of Israel.</p>

<p>The time had now arrived when some of the Saints of God<br/>
in the South began to take their families their carriages wagons<br/>
oxen horses tents arms &amp;c and move towards Zion as the [[children of Israel|children<br/>
of Israel]] according to commandment.</p>

<p>After breakfast on the 19th of September we repared<br/>
to the bank of a stream and prayer having been offered up<br/>
to God President [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Marsh]] led a young man into the waters<br/>
of baptism and he was confirmed upon the bank</p>

<p>The ceremony concluded we took the parting hand<br/>
of those beloved servants of God who with sister [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|Patten]] set off<br/>
towards Zion to be followed by others on the same day<br/>
with ox teams.</p>

<p>After spending a short time in arranging the<br/>
wagons and teams the company was prepared to move forward<br/>
It consisted of four families; including three Elders in the<br/>
camp. The families were these: [[Lewis Clapp|Lewis Clapp]] and family<br/>
[[John Camp|John Camp]] and family [[Albert Petty|Albert Petty]] and family and Elder<br/>
Benjamin Clapp and family; also Elders [[Benjamin Boydston|Boydstun]] and<br/>
[[Daniel Cathcart|Cathcart]]. The company chose Elder Boydstun as their<br/>
leader in their journey Zionward.</p>

<p>The company consisted of males 6 females 5, children 10<br/>
and one servant making in all twenty-two. They were principally<br/>
the first fruits of my ministry.</p>

<p>After bidding adiu to their friends they moved<br/>
forward on their journey in good spirits and with joy I rode<br/>
with them on their first day's travel as far as the Southfork<br/>

I never before had left a field of labour with as much<br/>
satisfaction and I felt to render up unto God the gratitude<br/>
of my heart for giving me so many souls as seals to my<br/>
ministry and I noted in my journal of that day the remarkable<br/>
fact that I had been led by the Spirit (a little over a quarter<br/>
of a year before) through a densely populated country for<br/>
eighty miles and chose no part of it for my field of labour<br/>
until I was led by the Lord to the house of [[John Benbow|John Benbow]]<br/>
at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] where I preached for the first time on the<br/>
5th of March. Now on the 22nd of June I was journing<br/>
to the Manchester Conference where will be represented<br/>
this fruitful field of my labours with thirty three organized<br/>
Churches numbering five hundred and forty one members<br/>
three hundred of whom received the ordinance of baptism<br/>
under my own hands</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] laboured with<br/>
me in this vineyard about one month from whom I and<br/>
the Saints received much benefit for he is mighty<br/>
in council and endowed with much wisdom.<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] had laboured with me two months<br/>
and was also a great blessing to us for he had<br/>
passed through a great school of experience and learnt<br/>

sat together.</p>

him. I also felt quite ill myself. This was an afflicting day to us</p>

<p>The next day was the <time datetime=""",09/01/1839
42828.0,175,,""">first of September</time> and Sunday<br/>
Elder Taylor felt much better and we concluded to spend the day<br/>
in the place and preach to the people. It was a German<br/>
settlement. I delivered a discourse on the [[first principles of the gospel|first principles<br/>
of the Gospel]] and other subjects. Brother Taylor followed and<br/>
spoke until he was quite exhausted not realizing his bodily<br/>
weakness. I became chilled myself and we returned to the<br/>
inn where we stoped when I was immediately taken with<br/>
the ague followed with high fever which lasted most of the<br/>
night.</p>

<p>The next day Elder Taylor was worse and had a<br/>
high bilious fever and could not continue his journey. It was<br/>
now evident that brother Taylor would have to be left behind<br/>
It was painful to think of parting from him and to leave<br/>
him sick nor should I have done so had I been able to<br/>
take care of him myself but this my health would not permit</p>

<p>Elder Taylor advised me to continue my<br/>
journey with Father [[John Coltrin|Coltrin]] and make the best of my way<br/>
to [[New York|New York]] and I accordingly concluded to take his<br/>
advise.</p>

<p>After committing my companion in the<br/>
ministry into the [[hands of God|hands of God]] I parted from him in<br/>

of our Divine Master on whose work we were and in<br/>

to do everything in their power to make him comfortable<br/>
until his recovery of which I had full confidence and<br/>
faith that the friends who promised to care for him<br/>
would keep their word.</p>

out of the State of [[Indiana|Indianna]] into the State of [[Ohio|Ohio]] and<br/>
passed through the town of [[Eaton, Preble County, Ohio|Eaton]] on our way where my<br/>
wife suffered with the brain fever last winter as we<br/>
journeyed west. I noted the house in particular where<br/>
Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] was healed by faith and the [[power of God|power of<br/>
God]]. We travelled this day 45 miles.</p>",
42828.0,83,1836-10-24,"<p>I assembled this small camp of Israel at Brother [[Albert Petty|Petty's]] tent to address<br/>
them for the last time in the South. When they were gathered together I<br/>
a<strike>r</strike>rose to speak to them upon the subject of their jo^u^rney. The rain was<br/>
descending in torrents so that we were soon wet through even within<br/>
a good tent. Yet my soul was full of emotion and inspired with feelings<br/>
of no ordinary character. I endeavored to lay before them the worth<br/>
and value of the cause in which they were engaged and that they were the<br/>
first in fulfilling the Prophets who spake of the South keeping not back<br/>
and that it would be recorded in the archieves of heaven to be read in<br/>
the day of eternity that they were the first fruits of the South who<br/>
spread their tents for Zion. I also gave them some practical counsel<br/>
in relation to their journey. I was followed by Elders [[Benjamin Boydston|Boydston]] [[Daniel Cathcart|Cathcart]]<br/>
and [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Clapp]] who spake in the Spirit of God with feelings of the deepest<br/>
interest. During the meeting the company covenanted to give heed<br/>
to him whom they had chosed as their leader. We closed by our<br/>
kneeling when I supplicated a throne of grace and implored the<br/>
mercy of God to rest upon the camp and that they might all<br/>
reach Zion in peace</p>

<p>In the morning we arose and found all well notwithstanding<br/>
the severity of the night. I breakfasted at brother Petty's tent and then <br/>
took the parting hand of these beloved Saints until I should meet<br/>
them soon in Zion. ""May the God of Israel attend them for<br/>
ever"" was the language of my heart at the time.</p>

at this place for three weeks and had baptized nine persons. During<br/>
the evening several came to inquire into the work and four offered<br/>
themselves for baptism. I spent the night at [[George Murrall|George Morrall's]]</p>

<p>Next day I met Elder Turley and was happy<br/>
to see him. He read a letter to me which he had received<br/>
from his wife containing much interesting matter to me. <br/>
He informed me among other items that Elders [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and<br/>
[[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] were set apart at the general conference by the Prophet<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] on the 6th of April to go to [[Jerusalem|Jereusalem]] and that they would<br/>
visit [[England|England]] on their way. The letter from sister [[Frances Kimberley Turley|Turley]]<br/>
also stated that sister [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] was at the conference and was<br/>
in good health. I preached that night at the house of Bro. <br/>
[[William Walker|Walker]] and four were baptized by Elder Turley.</p>

<p>The day following was also spent at<br/>
[[West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England|West Bromich]] and preached in the evening when another was<br/>
baptized and we ordained one priest and one teacher</p>

<p>So also was the 25 spent at the same<br/>
place where I again preached</p>

and my feelings and impressions upon visiting <strike>and</strike> ^the^ city and [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] as<br/>
written by me at that date.</p>

<p>The Temple of the Lord came in sight (first in importance<br/>
to our view) before we reached [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. I truly rejo<strike>y</strike>^i^ced as the<br/>
House of the Lord rose in the view as we drew near this stake<br/>
of Zion. It was the first time that I had seen the Temple<br/>
built by the commandment of God in this generation</p>

<p>We soon entered the place and I spent one of the most<br/>
interesting and happy days of my life. The day was occup<strike>p</strike>ied in<br/>
looking around Kirtland visiting the Temple and calling on the<br/>
Elders and Presidents of the Church</p>

<p>After a seperation of two years and a half I was much<br/>
rejo<strike>y</strike>iced to strike hands with the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] again and also<br/>
of many others of the beloved ones engaged in rolling on the<br/>
mighty work of God and of Israel. Among the rest I had<br/>
the privilege of again meeting with Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] and<br/>
becoming acquainted with his companion and [[Martha H. Raymond Parrish|wife]]. This gave<br/>
me much pleasure; for there is a joy in meeting our brethren<br/>
and companions in tribulations that the world knows not of<br/>
because it flows from a celestial source.</p>

<p>I spent a short time in conversing with my friends<br/>
and then a more important scene opened to my view than ever<br/>
kings saw in this generation. It was that of the Temple of<br/>
Israel's God. Our visit to that holy house was to us the<br/>
crow[n]ing event of the day. I was accompanied by brothers<br/>
[[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] and Parrish. Each ap<strike>p</strike>artment of the Temple was<br/>
visited in turn. When we crossed the thresho[l]d of the house<br/>
and passed into the lower room great solemnity amounting almost<br/>
to a feeling of awe came over me for I felt indeed that my<br/>
<strike>my</strike> footsteps were in the Temple of the Lord of Host^s^.</p>

<p>Having walked into the pulpits e<strike>r</strike>rected for the Priesthoods<br/>
and viewed the curtains we as<strike>s</strike>cended into the upper rooms. And<br/>
as we passed from view to view scenes met our eyes showing<br/>
the grandeur solemnity and order that nothing short of wisdom<br/>
from God could design</p>

<p>In the upper rooms we saw four Egyptian mumies<br/>
and the Book of ##Abraham|Abraham## written by his own<br/>

truly to rejoice to once mmore meet the Saints in this region<br/>
We had an interview with Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] and preached at Stoke<br/>
where we spent the night</p>

<p>The next day I met Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A<br/>
Smith]] and with him and brother [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] I wrote a letter to<br/>
President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and on the following being Sunday<br/>
we held a camp meeting at Stoke</p>

<p>There was a large congregation present<br/>
Elders Smith Turley and Cordon preached in the forenoon and<br/>
Elders Woodruff Glover and Smith in the afternoon</p>

<p>On the 29th the Churches of the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire<br/>
Potteries]] met at Hanly when the Branches were organized<br/>
into a Conference, called the Conference of the Stafforshire<br/>
Potteries. Elder George A. Smith was the president of<br/>
the meeting. I was present and assisted in the business of<br/>
the day.</p>

<p>July 1st Elders G. A. Smith and<br/>
Turley with myself rode to Manchester where we found<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimbale]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] at 149 Oldham Road.</p>

42828.0,177,1839-10-07,"<p>for a long time.</p>

<p>After singing and prayer I arose at the same<br/>
hour that my ague came on usually and addressed the assembly<br/>
I spoke for an hour or more in preaching the funeral sermon<br/>
of uncle [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna]].</p>

<p>I took a last look at the corps which was<br/>
very pleasent and it was conveyed to the graveyard where<br/>
my [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|mother]] [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|grandfather]] and many relatives were buried.</p>

<p>I did not go to the grave myself but after<br/>
conversing with two of my relatives upon the things of the Kingdom<br/>
I returned to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] very thankful that I had been<br/>
delivered from the ague this day notwithstanding that I had<br/>
been so exposed; nor did I have it any more for many<br/>
days</p>

other interesting sights. Everywhere as we viewed appartment after appartment<br/>

and skill revealled.</p>

<p>We then spent some time in visiting the [[Kirtland Safety Society Bank, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Bank]] and Printing<br/>
Office. It appeared that wonder upon wonder was opening before<br/>
me as these scenes in Zion became revealed and laid before my eyes as<br/>
the beginning of the great work of Israel's God in the last days. I thought,<br/>
<strike>""</strike>Well has the [[Isaiah (OT)|Prophet]] exclaimed, ""He does things we look not for"". [##Isaiah 64:3##]</p>

<p>Two years and a half had elapsed since I left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] with<br/>
my brethren in poverty to go up to visit our brethren in tribulation<br/>
in Zion. The Saints at Kirtland were then poor despised and looked<br/>
upon by the pomp of Babylon with disdain and people with eager<br/>
eyes wanted to behold them sink into forgetfulness. But what<br/>
a change has come? Now I  behold a cheerfulness beaming upon<br/>
every countenance and the scenes around indicate<s>d</s> prosperity. The<br/>
noise of the ax^e^ and the hammer and their bank and market and<br/>
especially the House of God speak in language loud as thunder that the<br/>
Saints will have a city in spite of all the false prophets of Baal and<br/>
in spite of even earth and hell combined because God is with them<br/>
and His [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] stands in honor of his kingdom while Babylon begins<br/>
to wonder and she will soon perish.""</p>

in the second one. In the third Elders [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson <br/>

arose and opened the meeting and then preached and<br/>
then came a discourse from the Prophet Joseph.</p>

<p>As there is something remarkable connected<br/>
with my turning to this chapter which seems to be<br/>
more than mere chance I will here give a page of <br/>
reminiscences of an earlier period of my life and before<br/>
I heard the Gospel. Indeed this I did on the occasion<br/>
of my first preaching in the House of the Lord on this<br/>
same afternoon of the Sa^b^bath of which I am writing<br/>
This page of reminiscences which I then related to the<br/>
congregation and which I shall here write was called<br/>
forth by the chapter in question and the scene before all<br/>
of which I looked upon as fulfilment of Divine promises<br/>
made to me by the Spirit years prior to this date.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of my life my mind had<br/>
been much exercised for several years concerning the<br/>
true Church and Kingdom of God for I did not beleive<br/>
that it existed in its true organization upon the earth<br/>
The growth of such ideas in my mind was doubtless<br/>
strengthened much and more or less ingendered there by the<br/>
teachings of an old Prophet by name [[Robert Mason|Mason]] of whom<br/>
I have spoken in [blank]</p>

<p>At the time to which I refer I had pled much<br/>
with the Lord in secret to lead me right. In the year<br/>
1830 I tended a flower mill in [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]] Ct. and during<br/>
this year there were great revivals in that town. The church<br/>
of Pres [blank] held protracted meetings ranging from three to<br/>
twenty <strike>daily</strike> ^days^. I attended some of them and had the privilege<br/>
of speaking my feelings to the people. They seemed frequently</p>",

Gospel to that distant colony sixteen thousand miles from his<br/>
native land.</p>

<p>July th 7th I met with the Twelve and a number<br/>
of the Priesthood beside in council at the Millinnial Star Office<br/>
whe<strike>re</strike>n much important business was transacted and a field<br/>
of labour assigned to each officer until the next General<br/>
Conference.</p>

<p>After dinner the Twelve met by appointment<br/>
in front of the Infirmary and proceeded to a Paper storehouse<br/>
where [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley]] had made a contract for paper suficient<br/>
to print five thousand copies of the Book of Mormon. After<br/>
seeing the papers weighed and prayed for (cost £107) we walked<br/>
to Brother ^Miller^ where I took refreshments with about 20 Elders<br/>
and had a pleasant time. The Twelve then went to the Star Office<br/>
and held a council when it was voted that Parley might<br/>
go to [[New York|New York]] and get his family and that Elder [[Theodore Turley|Theodore <br/>
Turley]] should lead a company of Saints from [[England|England]] to <br/>
[[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] (or [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]) After some other business the meeting<br/>
adjourned to meet the next morning.</p>

<p>I wrote a letter to [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] next day and<br/>
on the following one for publication in the Millinnial Star<br/>
and on the day after a number of letters to my friends and<br/>
family in America to be forwared by Brother Parley to New<br/>
York and on the next I assisted brother Brigham and several<br/>
of the sisters in doing up a package of No 3 of the Millennial<br/>
Star for Parley to take to New York</p>

<p>On the 12th I attended meeting at the Joiners<br/>

more than one. I [[priesthood blessing|administered]] to sixteen sick persons and<br/>

of earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the Saints and for<br/>
the organization of the Church upon the ancient pattern and when I <br/>
farther contended for the gifts and graces of the Church as manifested in<br/>
the days of the Prophets and of Christ and his Apostles both priest and<br/>
people would oppose me. Therefore I could not unite with them<br/>
in Spirit nor feel at home in their meetings</p>

<p>It was during this state of things that I went before the<br/>
Lord one evening and prayed till past the midnight hour. I pled<br/>
with him to show me what to do and asked him in substance<br/>
the following questions:</p>

<p>""If the sects of the day are thy people O Lord and are<br/>
by Thee acknowledged in their worship and ordinances why am<br/>
I seperated from them in Spirit and feeling? and if they are not<br/>
Thy people why do they prosper?""</p>

<p>Of course in my prayers and suplications of that night<br/>
the questions which I have here tersely given was much lengthy<br/>
and varied than written above. But they contain the burden of<br/>
my petitions to the Lord at that time, to whom I talked in<br/>
the simplicity and straitforwardness of a child approaching his<br/>
father.</p>

<p>The Spirit answered and said unto me open the<br/>
Bible and it shall there be shown thee. This injunction I obeyed<br/>
and opened at random apparantly though I beleive it was directed<br/>
by the Spirit and read the ##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah##. There is not<br/>
a Chapter in the whole Bible which affords a more remarkable<br/>
and suitable answer to the prayers of that night. The chapter <br/>
indicated that salvation was near and the righteousness of God about to<br/>
be revealed; and [blank]</p>

<p>[eight lines blank]</p>

<p>I was satisfied with the answer to my prayer and<br/>
became convinced that the Churchs of the day were not of heavenly<br/>
origin and that they did not form the Church and Kingdom of God</p>",

<p>My wife also informed me that an Indian with<br/>
his wife and daughter had been baptized. He was the Indian Interpreter<br/>
of six tribes. Two Elders with their families had gone out on mission<br/>
to the Indians.</p>

<p>July the 15th I parted from Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
and the Saints at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and rode to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] where I again<br/>
met Elders [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]]. I brought with<br/>
me 110 Stars for brother Cordon and for brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] for<br/>
the [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] Saints 550 numbers and about 100 Hymn Books</p>

<p>Next day I visited [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] and [[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]]<br/>
where the Saints manifested much joy at seeing me again. I<br/>
was presented with a small splendid china box as a present<br/>
from the Saints in Stoke upon Trent. That night I preached<br/>
at Hanly and baptized one.</p>

<p>On the following day July 17th I wrote two<br/>
letters to [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] to be sent in a letter. I afterwards found that<br/>
my first born child</p>

<p>[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma Woodruff]] Died on this Day.</p>

<p>Next day I wrote to Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] and a letter to the Saints<br/>
from [[Fox Islands, Waldo County, Maine|Fox Islands]] at [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa|Montrose]] and then walked to [[Leek, Staffordshire, England|Leek]] in<br/>
company of Elder George A Smith. This is the metropolis<br/>
of the Morelands. There is a large stone cr<strike>i</strike>o<strike>n</strike>ss in the Church yard<br/>
erected many centuries ago in honour of some Roman<br/>
Catholic dignitaries. In 1645 the rebels of [[Scotland|Scotland]] broke <br/>
off the head and built a fire around it and the smoke <br/>
still remains.</p>

<p>The 19th being Sunday I preached at Leek<br/>
when Mr [[John Jones|John Jones]] came to oppose us. His carriage<br/>
broke down on the road and he was thrown into the mud<br/>
He came to our meeting but the Lord shut his mouth<br/>
and he could not utter a word but left the room as soon<br/>
as I had closed. In the even^ing^ George A Smith preached and<br/>
afterwards six were baptized under his hands. We also<br/>
ordained 2 and several were healed by our administration</p>",

<p>On the <time datetime=""",01/11/1840
42828.0,180,,""">11th of January 1840</time> the city of<br/>
Liverpool appeared in sight and soon after a steam<br/>
tug came along side and towed us in. Arriving<br/>
in Liverpool we visited several of its most noted places<br/>
that day. During the evening I wrote three letters one<br/>
to [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] one to my [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|brother-in-law]] and one to my<br/>
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]].</p>

<p>We spent Sunday the day following our<br/>
arrival in visiting several of the churches of Liverpool.</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast we went<br/>
on board the Oxford to get our trunks. The porter took<br/>
our trunks and boxes to Mr [[George Cannon|George Cannon's]] Norfolk<br/>
Street. He was a brother-in-law of Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]</p>

<p>Our provision chest and a box containing<br/>
our bed and beding we left with him and then took<br/>
our trunks to the railway <u>depôt</u> and started per rail for<br/>
Preston Lancashire.</p>

<p>For the first mile we were under groung<br/>
in a tunnel cut out of a solid rock with buildings and<br/>
people over our heads.</p>

<p>We started from Liverpool about 6 o'clock<br/>
and arrived in Preston about 8 and called at the house<br/>
of brother Greenwood<strike>'s</strike>.</p>

<p>Elder [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] was sent for</p>",
42828.0,88,1836-12-01,"<p>I was moreover assured that I should live to find the true Church<br/>
and that I should be gathered with the people of God and have<br/>
a place and a name within the walls of His [[house of God|House]].</p>

<p>From that time I continued in this hope and<br/>
did not join any religious body until I heard the [[fulness of the gospel|fulness of <br/>
the Gospel]] and became a member of the Church of Latter-<br/>
day Saints.</p>

<p>I have now brought up my reminiscences to<br/>
that Sa^b^b<strike>e</strike>^a^th afternoon when I was called into the Stand to<br/>
address a congregation of Saints assembled in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]]<br/>
of the Lord. As I arose before the people to speak to them<br/>
I again opened the Bible at random as on the night of<br/>
which I have been na^r^rating. This time as before I again<br/>
opened to the ##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah## which was given to me<br/>
in answer to my prayer in 1830.</p>

<p>Directly all the scenes of that night were<br/>
brought fresh to my mind and I felt to rejoice before<br/>
the Lord and his Saints that I had lived to see the fulfilment<br/>
of the promise of the Spirit to me seven years before.</p>

<p>Having na^r^rated this incident to the<br/>
congregation I gave a sketch of my travels in the South<br/>
and was then followed by Elder [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]]. Bread and wine<br/>
were then blessed as the sacrament of the Lord's supper and<br/>
we had the privilege of communing for the first time in<br/>
the Temple with Saints gathered to this Stake of Zion from<br/>
the East and the West and the North and the South.</p>

<p>A number of the Saints met in the [[House of the Lord|House of<br/>
the Lord]] <time datetime=""",12/01/1836
42828.0,88,1836-12-04,""">December 1st</time> to receive from under the hands<br/>
of Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] their Patriarchal Blessings.<br/>
I went up to the Temple to witness the scene and to<br/>
hear the promises made to those Saints by the [[spirit of revelation|spirit<br/>
of revelation]] and [[spirit of prophecy|Prophecy]]. This was the first meeting<br/>
of the kind I had ever attended</p>

care of [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]. Afterwards we parted from the<br/>
Saints at [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] and took coach to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] where<br/>
at night we attended the Seventeenth Anniversary of the<br/>
Birmingham Auxiliary to the Baptist Missionary society<br/>
at the Town Hall. This is one of the principal public<br/>
buildings in [[England|England]] and has the largest organ in <br/>
that country perhaps the largest in the world. It is 52<br/>
feet in height and contained 3000 pipes and 68 stops. The <br/>
Hall could seat 5000 and it was c[r]owded. The chair was<br/>
taken at 6 o'clock and there were gathered there that evening<br/>
the best ministerial talant in [[Europe|Europe]].</p>

<p>Next day we traveled by coach to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]]<br/>
and thence to [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]] where Elder Smith remained<br/>
but I walked to [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] and held a meeting that night</p>

<p>The following day we walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]]<br/>
and found the Saints strong in the faith and increasing<br/>
fast in numbers and preparing for emigration with<br/>
the Saints to the body of the Church in America. [[John Benbow|Bro]]<br/>
and sister [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Benbow]] were willing to make every sacrifice<br/>
for the gathering of the poor among God's people. A company<br/>
of about 50 were to start in a few days from the<br/>
[[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] district 40 of whom would go by the<br/>
generous help and philantrophy of Elder John Benbow</p>

<p>After my return to my field of labour<br/>
I continued my ministerial labours Elder George A. Smith<br/>
being with me. I was happy to learn that the work in<br/>
Herefordshire and adjoining country was rolling on rapidly<br/>
on every hand. The Elders and priests were universally<br/>
blessed in their ministry in this part of the vinyard<br/>
They were baptizing daily. Elder [[Thomas Richardson|Richardson]] had baptized<br/>
about 40 since his arrival and Elder [[William Kay|Key]] about 20 and <br/>
Elders [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] Benbow [[John Cheese|Cheese]] [[Hiram Clark, b. 1795|Clark]] and others had<br/>

they were not all present the quorum was not fully organized<br/>

I pronounced upon his head by the Spirit of Prophesy on the<br/>

of my Journal as usual for the year which I will give as<br/>
before with my closing reflections for 1836.</p>

<p><u>Synopsis of the Year.</u></p>

<p>Travels and Meetings held:</p>

<p>I traveled six thousand five hundred and fifty seven<br/>
miles and held one hundred and fifty three meetings</p>

<p><u>Conferences and Debates:</u></p>

<p>I attended four Conferences among the Southern Churches<br/>
and held four debates.</p>

<p><u>Baptisms</u> Etc.</p>

<p>I baptised and confirmed twenty seven souls and ordained<br/>
two Elders three Priests on^e^ Teacher and two Deacons. I <br/>
also attended to the ordinance of [[priesthood blessing|blessing]] nineteen children<br/>
and four persons were healed of disease [[laying on of hands|under my hands]]<br/>
by the power of God.</p>",
42828.0,229,,"<p>since the General Conference there had been baptized 250 in this region</p>

<p>The churches here now numbered 800 members. I no longer continued<br/>
myself to baptize but called the local and traveling ministry under<br/>
my direction to administer the ordinance of baptism while [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A. Smith]] and myself devoted ourselves to preaching the gospel<br/>
holding councils comfirming members healing the sick and blessing<br/>
and building up the Saints. We were looking every day at this <br/>
date for Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]].</p>

<p>As soon as brother Heber arrived it was our<br/>
purpose to take our leave of the Saints in this region and<br/>
go with him to</p>

<p>The City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] on a mission<br/>
to warn the inhabitants thereof and preach to them the<br/>
Gospel.</p>

<p>On the 5th of this month I wrote a letter to the<br/>
Millennial Star and on the next day I sealed up a package<br/>
of 42 letters and my Journal from [[Montrose, Angus, Scotland|Montrose]] to [[England|England]] to send<br/>
to my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] by Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]]. It contained all my correspondence<br/>
since the 8th of August 18<strike>2</strike>39. Enclosed also was No 1 and 3 of<br/>
the Millennial Star.</p>

<p>It was one year on the 8th since I left<br/>
Montrose and parted from my family to take a mission<br/>
to England and my history will show how the Twelve started<br/>
under afflictions and pain how fever and ague followed us<br/>
on our journey and it will show how also the Providence<br/>
of God afterwards was manifest and how wonderfully we<br/>
had been blessed in the British Mission</p>

<p>August the 11th Elder Turley started for<br/>
[[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] to prepare a ship for about 80 Saints to emigrate<br/>
and the fact that the man at whose ^house^ I first planted the<br/>
seeds of the work in this part of the Lord's vineyard now<br/>
gathered at his own expense 40 of this 80 bound for the gathering<br/>
place of the Saints. He gave one hundred pounds to<br/>
Elder Turley to pay the deposit money and secure the passage<br/>
of those who were to go through his benevolence. From<br/>
my soul I said ""Let the blessing of Almighty God<br/>
rest upon brother [[John Benbow|John Benbow]] for ever"" We took<br/>

than a few minutes before I was called upon to visit three<br/>
sick persons and [[priesthood blessing|administer]] to them.</p>

<p>One case was very distressing. We found<br/>
the sister possessed of the Devil and a burning fever on the<br/>
brain. She was raging and trying to tare herself to pieces<br/>
although in the hands of three or four men.</p>

<p>We [[laying on of hands|laid hands upon]] the woman and<br/>
commanded the devil to depart and the fever to be rebuked<br/>
in the name of Jesus Christ and it was done though<br/>
not without a great struggle. We left her sane and<br/>
mostly delivered of her pains</p>

in the fore part of the day. In the afternoon we broke<br/>
bread together in Sacrament and in the evening I preached to<br/>
a large congregation</p>

<p>Two offered themselves for baptism and<br/>
we laid hands upon twenty persons that were sick or<br/>
afflicted and they were usually healed.</p>

<p>At noon it was with difficulty that<br/>
we could get out of the house for the press of the Saints wishing<br/>
to shake hands with us</p>

<p>The Saints in [[England|England]] had great<br/>
confidence in God and his servants and there were so<br/>
many applying for the laying on of hands that it required<br/>
on our parts great faith and much of the Spirit to answer<br/>
to the faith in the people.</p>

his cause and preaching the Gospel of his son Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><b>INVOCATION FOR THE YEAR.</b></p>

<p>In opening this chapter I will extract from my Journal the<br/>
following invocation for the year 1837.</p>

<p>""O Lord I ask thee in the name of Jesus Christ Thy Son to<br/>
look upon Thy servant Wilford who now occupies a place in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]<br/>
this first stake of Zion which Thou hast appointed in this [[last dispensation|last<br/>
dispensation]] and fulness of times for the gathering of Thy Saints<br/>
O God of Israel inspire the heart and pen of thy servant at this time<br/>
and hear and answer the prayer which he will put up unto Thee<br/>
and remember the covenant which Thy servant will make with<br/>
Thee O mighty God of [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]].</p>

<p>""O Lord Thou has spared my life to behold the commencement<br/>
of 1837. May my life health and strength be precious in Thy sight<br/>
throughout the year just begun. Wilt Thou save me by Thy<br/>
grace from all sin and the powers of temptation which try the<br/>
souls of men? Wilt thou give me favor during the year with<br/>
God and his Saints? Wilt Thou bless me while in school and<br/>
in meeting with the quorums of Seventies and while attending all<br/>
other meetings for Divine worship?</p>

<p>""O Lord if it by thy will give me the privilege of recording<br/>
in this year's Journal Great blessings pronounced upon my head<br/>
from mine [[anointing|an^n^ointing]] and under the hands of the Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph]] <br/>
and also an account of visions and revelations of Jesus Christ that I<br/>
might be a special witness of Thee O Lord. If I am called to [[preach the gospel|preach<br/>
the Gospel]] this year may I be blessed with souls for my hire. If I<br/>
visit my kinsmen wilt thou make me an instrument of bringing<br/>
them into thy celestial Kingdom. And I covenant with Thee<br/>
O Lord to go and come at Thy bidding. I ask these blessings<br/>
through the Priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.""</p>

<p>In company of Elder [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[George Albert Smith|Smith]]<br/>
and myself rode from Leigh to [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|Cheltenham]] where we tarried<br/>
for the night and on the morrow August the 18th we continued<br/>
to journey to the metropolis of [[England|England]]</p>

<p>We took coach at Cheltenham and rode<br/>
40 miles through a level country having quite the appearance<br/>
of the [[Illinois|Illinois]] and [[Missouri|Missouri]] prairies &amp; occupied altogether for<br/>
farming. We passed by three villages and thousands of<br/>
acres of wheat and barley fields in the season of harvest.<br/>
Part of the crops were cut and part standing and the<br/>
country arround everywhere wore the golden hue of<br/>
plentiful harvest.</p>

<p>We passed through [[Oxfordshire, England|Oxfordshire]] and<br/>
within about eight miles of the [[Oxford University, Oxfordshire, England|Oxford University]]. This<br/>
is the largest and most famed University in the world</p>

<p>Journing through Oxfordshire we saw vast<br/>
herds of cattle sheep and deer. We passed insight of<br/>

and the [[Wychwood Forest, Oxfordshire, England|Wychwood Forest]] containing seven thousand<br/>

believing but she made objections to being baptized then because<br/>
she had a dead child in the house. I told her to let<br/>
the dead burry the dead and to arise and follow us</p>

<p>The woman followed and we walked<br/>
two miles and I baptized the three females. Their husbands<br/>
were in the Church and were present at the baptism of<br/>
their wives.</p>

<p>We visited [[Stone, Staffordshire, England|Sto<strike>k</strike>^n^e]] on the <time datetime=""",02/17/1840
42828.0,184,,""">17th</time> for the<br/>
purpose of getting a door open for the preaching of the Gospel<br/>
An house was obtained and I preached to a small congregation<br/>
in the evening</p>

<p>The next day we left Stone and walked<br/>
to [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]]. On our way we paid<br/>
<b>A Visit<br/>
to<br/>
The [[George Granville Sutherland-Leveson-Gower|Duke of Sutherland's]] Park.</b></p>

<p>It is about five miles in length and five<br/>
in bredth. The first thing of note that struck our attention<br/>
as we came on the road from Stone to Stoke was the estate<br/>
of several hundred acres of ground planted over with young<br/>
^timber^ sprouts. This land was hilly.</p>

<p>Next came spring vale. The lower fountain<br/>
is a forced vein throwing a stream of water twelve feet high<br/>
There is a fish pond above the first fountain but rather<br/>
small. On the hill above is a spendid stone house for<br/>
the purpose of keeping persons who might be insane. Around<br/>
this vale are a number of small monuments.</p>

<p>Then came into our view the Manor House<br/>
built of stone. This was mostly in ruins and was more than<br/>
five hundred years old. One family had lived in it for more<br/>
than three hundred years descending from father to son.</p>

<p>We next visited the spendid monument<br/>
errected in memory of [[George Granville Leveson-Gower|George Granville]] the late Duke and <br/>
father of the present Duke of Sutherland.</p>

<p>This monument is built of hewn stone</p>",

and myself were called upon by the Presidents to come forward and<br/>
be ordained as members of the [[First Quorum of the Seventy|first Seventy]] Elders of Israel to<br/>
bear the name of Jesus to the nations of the earth. The first<br/>
Seventy was chosen out of the [[Zion|camp]] that went up to Zion in<br/>
1834 for the redemption of Zion; but as we were not present<br/>
at the time we were afterward ordained into the [[Second Quorum of the Seventy|Second Quorum]]<br/>
There being however two vacancies in the first now we were<br/>
chosen to fill those vacancies. President Aldrich ordained<br/>
Elder Holmes and President Z. Coltrin ordained me. Great<br/>
blessings were pronounced upon our heads by the spirit of revelation</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",01/06/1837
42828.0,92,1837-01-23,""">6th</time> I visited the office of the [[Kirtland Safety Society Bank, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland<br/>
Safety Society]] and saw the first money issued by the society's<br/>
Treasurer. It was given to brother [[Jacob Bump|Bump]] (in exchange<br/>
for other notes) who was the first to circulate it. I also<br/>
heard President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] declare in the presence of<br/>
[[Frederick Granger Williams|F Williams]] [[David Whitmer|D. Whitmer]] [[Samuel Harrison Smith|S. Smith]] and others that he had<br/>
received that morning the word of the Lord upon the subject<br/>
of the Kirtland Safety Society. He was alone in a room<br/>
by himself and he not only heard the voice of the Spirit<br/>
but it was also an audible voice</p>

blessing from the mouth of the Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph]]. I gave<br/>
brother Smoot a copy of it in print.</p>

property but they did not come as threatened. The wrath of<br/>
our enemies however was kindling against us in this part and<br/>
seemed to the watchful the scourge awaiting the people of Zion</p>

heard the Prophet Joseph address the people for several hours<br/>

though not half as long as [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] was in the [[Mount Sinai|Mount]] [##Exodus 24:18##] yet many<br/>

<p>At [[Faringdon Road Station, West Challow, Berkshire, England|Farington Station]] we took the train for<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] at 1 o'clock p.m. We passed through Relicks and had a <br/>
good view of the old ruins and as we dashed along in the<br/>
cars we had also a fine view of the splendid W<br/>
castle. After travelling on the rail 70 miles we reached<br/>
the great metropolis of [[England|England]].</p>

<p>The City of London<br/>
at 4 o'clock p.m.</p>

<p>We took conveyance to the centre of the city<br/>
by omnibus, <strike>and then</strike> walked across [[London Bridge, London, Middlesex, England|London Bridge]] into<br/>
the Borough, and called upon Mrs [[Mary Ann Kimberley Allgood|Allgood]], <strike>19 King Street</strike>,<br/>
<strike>in the City</strike>. <strike>She is</strike> the sister of Elder [[Theodore Turley|Theadore Turley's]]<br/>
[[Frances Kimberley Turley|wife]]. She treated us with kindness, <strike>and</strike> gave us<br/>
refreshments and then directed us to a public house, <br/>
the [[King|King's Arms]], King Street, Borough. Here we tarried<br/>
for the night. <strike>and I wrote a letter to my wife.</strike></p>

<p>We were now in England's great metropolis<br/>
to sound to it the first proclamation of the Latter-Day<br/>
Work; for</p>

<p>[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]], <br/>

Latter-Day Saints.</p>

<strike>a mile or two</strike> into the city, passed London Bridge twice<br/>
and returned and spent the night at the King's Arms.<br/>
<strike>There was so much passing in the street of drays and cabs<br/>
and singing and hallowing at all hours of the night that<br/>
it was with difficulty I could sleep at all</strike></p>

<p><strike>I wrote a letter to Elders Young and<br/>
Richards next day and also another to Bro F Pullin and<br/>
then we took a walk through the city.</strike> ^On the following day^ We called<br/>
upon the Rev. [[J. E. Smith|J. E. Smith]] [[Lincoln|Lincoln's Inn Fields]], <strike>and</strike><br/>
also visited [[John Pye|John Pye]] 16 Curiosity Street Chancery Lane.</p>",

<p>The [[George Granville Leveson-Gower|Duke]] was of course a member of the British<br/>
Parliament and as an emblem of his legislative character he held in<br/>
his ^left^ hand a roll of paper. He stands facing his splendid mansion which<br/>
is an expensive and majestic building in the vale north of the monument<br/>
at which a person has a fine view of it.</p>

<p>The house covers 4 acres and is built of hewn<br/>
stone having much carved work of lions and other images. There were<br/>
365 windows in it before the repairs and additions which the present<br/>
[[George Granville Sutherland-Leveson-Gower|Duke]] was making which it was supposed would take seven years<br/>
to accomplish.</p>

<p>There were some hundreds of acres of woodland<br/>
on the estate and farm patches all of which were enclosed with<br/>
a fence of 4 or 5 feet high. The whole of the fence was composed<br/>
of solid iron railing miles in length.</p>

<p>In this park the Duke had vast quanties<br/>
of game fish and fowl. The deer was as tame as sheep. We<br/>
saw about 300 of them in one drove.</p>

<p>The [[River Trent, England|river Trent]] runs through the Park<br/>
and the Duke has converted the whole of it for some distance<br/>
into a fish pond.</p>

<p>I visit the bur<s>r</s>ying ground which was<br/>
covered with many kinds of evergreen.</p>

<p>The public road running through the Park<br/>
is between two stone walls about 10 feet thick and from four<br/>
to six feet high covered with turf and green grass.</p>

<p>The Duke of Sutherland has two other<br/>
Parks as valuable as the one we visited and his wealth was<br/>
comparatively inexhaustible and beyond his own knowledge.</p>

Prophet of the Lord God.</p>

<p>The next month was principally spent in my attending school<br/>
and some interesting meetings and preparing myself for my endowments<br/>
which I was soon to have the privilege of receiving in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] of the<br/>
Lord with many others.</p>

<p>On <time datetime=""",03/23/1837
42828.0,93,1837-03-26,""">March 23rd</time> I went up to the House of the Lord at an<br/>
early hour in the morning to spend the day in prayer and fasting<br/>
with the Saints in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] as this was a day set apart for that<br/>
purpose. Immediately after en^t^ering the House in company<br/>
^with^ <strike>of</strike> several other Elders I went within the veil and we bowed<br/>
before the Lord in the Aronic Stand and offer<strike>r</strike>ed up our morning <br/>
sacrifice. The Spirit rested upon us with joy to our souls.</p>

<p>I was then called upon by Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph]] to read<br/>
a chapter in the Book of Mormon and I read a chapter from the<br/>
Book of ##Jacob 5|Jacob## which contains the parable of the tame olive tree<br/>
likened unto the house of Israel as was spoken by the Prophet<br/>
[[Zenos (BofM)|Zenos]]. The same God that touched [[Isaiah (OT)|Isaiah's]] lips with hallowed<br/>
^fire^ gave Zenos great wisdom in setting forth this parable.</p>

<p>When I had made some brief remarks upon the<br/>
subject the congregation took their seats for the service of the<br/>
day in the following order:</p>

<p>The house being divided into four parts by veils the<br/>
females occupied two parts and the males the others. Some of the<br/>
Presidency presided in each appartment</p>

<p>The time was taken up during the day in singing<br/>
exhortation and prayer. Some had a [[gift of tongues|tongue]] others an [[interpretation of tongues|interpretation]] <br/>
and all was done in order. The power of God rested upon the<br/>
congregation. Upon some the gifts were poured out while others<br/>
had the [[ministration of angels|administration of angles]] and the image of God sat upon<br/>
the countenances of the Saints.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon the veils were all rolled<br/>
up together which brought the whole congregation in full view of<br/>
each other and while the presence of the Lord filled the house the<br/>
congregation of Saints fell upon their knees and all as with one accord<br/>
vocally poured forth rejoicing supplication and prayer before the [[God of Israel|God of<br/>
Israel]]. This closed the service of the day after contributing for<br/>
the support of the poor.</p>

viewing the splendid works of man</p>

city of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. We crossed London Bridge, <strike>and</strike> passed<br/>
through King William Street, and several other streets, and visited <br/>

We entered a door at its base, (paid 6 pence on entering,) and<br/>
ascended 345 black marble steps, which brought us up 200<br/>
feet into the air and about 100 feet higher than the highest<br/>
houses. We steped on the outside of the pillar, which is<br/>
surrounded by an iron railing; and here we had presented<br/>

the Kingdom of God established upon the earth and the<br/>
covenants made by the Lord unto [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]] [[Isaac (OT)|Isaac]] and [[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]]<br/>

place of so many great historical episodes of English history, the<br/>
scene of many of the capital tragedies of England and the terrible<br/>
Bastile of England the frowning political sepulcure of the<br/>

of the land have buried their victims their secrets and their<br/>

in full view and one not seen from the Monument making<br/>
six: <strike>One of the collossal arched Bridges of the Thames is<br/>
of solid cast iron called Southwark Bridge. This also is the<br/>
celebrated ""Suspension Bridge"" which at this time was one<br/>
of the great wonders of the age. The other collossal and<br/>
magnificent bridges of the royal Thames (England's chief river)<br/>
are London Bridge Blackfriars Waterloo Westminster and<br/>
Vaushall all of which are built of massive stone.</strike> These<br/>
six bridges are fine sights in themselves. They are the<br/>

was London Borough, on the South of the River, and all<br/>
around us hundreds of churches, chaples and spires, <br/>

covering about six square miles of ground</p>

twenty two persons and ordained [[John Cheese|John Cheese]] to the office of Priest.</p>

<p>In the evening I preached to a congregation of<br/>
about eight hundred but some of the baser sort made much<br/>
disturbance. There was a number of persons that wished to<br/>
be <strike>p</strike>baptized but they had to return home without it in<br/>
consequence of the people.</p>

<p>On the next day I walked to Mainston<br/>
and obtained a license for preaching in any place under the<br/>
English Government.</p>

and found them beleiving. I preached at Froom's Hill and<br/>
baptized three persons</p>

our bodies from head to foot with soap and water we then washed ourselves<br/>
in clean water and afterwards with perfumed spirits. The evening was<br/>
spent with several Elders in prayer before God and his [[power of God|power]] rested<br/>
copiously upon us.</p>

the ordinance. Myself and Elder G. W. Meeks were the first washed<br/>
under the hands of President Joseph Young and we then assisted him<br/>
in washing our brethren the Elders. Much of the Holy Spirit rested<br/>
upon us.</p>

<p>At early candle light we again met together in the<br/>
quorum of Seventies at the upper part of the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Lord's house]] to receive<br/>

was opened by prayer those who were to be anointed were suitably<br/>
addressed and then the Presidency proceeded to the ordinance by<br/>
first consecrating the oil. The person then presented for the<br/>
anointing took a seat and the Presidency [[laying on of hands|laid their hands]] upon<br/>
his head and pronounced such blessings upon him as the [[testimony of Jesus|testimony <br/>

ordinance of the house of God. There were fifteen anointed in<br/>
our quorum. President Coultrin anointed me and pronounced<br/>
upon my head great blessings which were sealed upon my head in<br/>
the name of Jesus Christ by a loud Amen from all present</p>

into the lower court of the House of the Lord with Elders [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B.<br/>
Nobles]] and G. W. Meeks to spend the night in prayer and fasting<br/>
before God. Part of the night we had a severe trial of our faith<br/>
by temptation from Satan but before day we obtained a good degree<br/>
of victory over him and the Lord poured out his [[spirit of the Lord|spirit]] upon us<br/>

from the Tower by the Thames side to the Temple Church<br/>
and from the North East Gate along the City wall to Holborn<br/>
Bridge. To the estates and fortunes of the citizens it <br/>
was merciless but to their lives very favourable (only eight<br/>
being lost) That it might in all things resemble the<br/>
last conflagration of the world the destruction was sudden<br/>
for in a small space of time the same city was set [ink smear]<br/>

to before they could proceed with the order of the day</p>

<p>In the first place six of the Presidents of the<br/>
Seventies were taken from that position and transferred<br/>
to the quorum of the [[traveling high council|travelling High Priests]] and six other<br/>
Presidents were chosen in their stead. I shall not give the<br/>

through the lower court. Excepting St Peter's at Rome this is the<br/>
largest and most famed in the world.</strike></p>

<p><strike>St Paul's is 500 feet long 285 feet wide<br/>
from North to South 404 high from East to West and<br/>
it contains 74 monuments of fine marble erected over the<br/>
toombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals and Earls and men<br/>
of other titles who have distinguished themselves in the military<br/>
service of Great Britian and otherwise. Lord Nelson's <br/>
Monument is the largest and most noted of the whole of<br/>
the men thus honoured. Their bodies are placed in the <br/>
vaults and their monuments erected on the flour above</strike></p>

<p><strike>St. Paul's church was first built by St Augustine<br/>
in the year 610 and was destroyed by fire in 961 and<br/>
rebuilt the following year. It was not until the reign of<br/>
Athelstan that London became the Metropolis of England<br/>
and it was to this King that St Paul's was mostly indebted<br/>
for its permanent establishment and pre-eminence. In 1086<br/>
it was again destroyed by fire which also laid the greater part<br/>
of the Metropolis in ruins. Maurice Bishop of London who<br/>
had been chaplain and Chancellor to William the Conqurer conceived<br/>
the vast design of erecting the magnificient structure which<br/>
immediately preceeded the present cathedral. In 1099 it was<br/>
sufficiently built to admit of public worship but was again partly<br/>
burned in 1132 and again in 1135-6 and sustained considerable<br/>
injury. The central tower was completed in 1221 and additions<br/>
was made to the building from time to time. The lofty spire<br/>
of the Cathedral was fired by lighting in 1444 and not repaired<br/>
till 1462 and in 1561 it again caught on fire and the roof<br/>
^was^ also destroyed. Queen Elizabeth commenced to repair it and<br/>

not take no for an answer and they followed me until 2 o'clock<br/>
in the morning in search for water</p>

<p>We finally found a stream and baptized five<br/>
persons in a place where we had to let them down eight feet by a<br/>
bank before we reached the water. Three of these were preachers and<br/>
one an old [[Francis Stallard Brush|woman]] who had followed us the whole of the time leaning<br/>

<p>At about candle-light the meeting commenced<br/>
with great interest. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] requested the congregation to speak their<br/>

Elders [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Nobles]]. We were afterwards<br/>
joined by an aged father in Israel by name [[Freeman Nickerson|Freeman Nickerson]]<br/>
who was very faithful and a man of much prayer. Before<br/>
he joined us the power of Satan strove much against us; but<br/>
our faith and peseverance in the Lord overcame him and we<br/>
were as baptized with the Holy Ghost</p>

<p>When we first entered the House of the Lord<br/>
we entered one of the Stands within the veils and fell upon our<br/>
knees but the Evil One strove against us with so much power<br/>
and temptation that at one time I was driven from my<br/>
stand. But notwithstanding his apparant victory good grew<br/>
out of it for by going into the courtyard I found father Nickerson<br/>
whom I solicited to join us that we might gain a victory over<br/>
Satan. He joyfully accepted the invitation and we were now<br/>
four in number and of one accord. Moreover we had great<br/>
cause to be united in heart for we had travelled together about<br/>
one thousand miles in the Spring of 1834 for the redemption of<br/>
Zion. At that time we offered to lay down our lifes and <br/>
our offerings were accepted as was [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham's]] [##Genesis 22##] and now we could<br/>
unitedly prevail and obtain a blessing through Jesus Christ.<br/>
We fell upon our knees and cried mightily unto the Lord and<br/>
the Evil one departed and the Spirit of God within us was like<br/>
fire shut up in our bones and many great things was shown unto<br/>
us by the Holy Ghost and minifested in prophecy and revelation</p>",

that he had been to america, and had come to London for<br/>
the purpose of going to [[South Australia, Australia|South Australia]], but had just burried<br/>
one child and another laid at the point of death. Brother<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] told him his child should live. He gave us some<br/>
information where we could preach. On the same day we<br/>
called upon him and found his child better, but he was<br/>
not at home. We then went and heard a Calvinest preach<br/>
and he gave us an invitation to call and see him</p>

<p>Next day we again went over the city to see<br/>
if we could ^find^ any of the children of God. We found one man<br/>
and his household who received our testimony, and he opened<br/>
his doors for us to preach. We appointed a meeting at his house<br/>
for Sunday evening. His name was [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]], and he lived at<br/>

the name of God to ^go^ into the streets and lift up our voices</p>

<p>Accordingly Elders Kimball, [[George Albert Smith|Smith]], and myself<br/>
started out on Sunday morning, August the 30th; walked<br/>
three miles and stoped in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]], Old Street, where<br/>
we found an Aitkenite preaching to the people, who was<br/>
followed by a Presbyterian. Just as the latter was about to<br/>
begin, Elder Kimball informed him that there was a preacher<br/>
from America present who would like to speak when he<br/>
got through. The preacher then informed the people that<br/>
there was an American minister present, and proposed that<br/>
he should speak first. Elder George A Smith then got into<br/>
the chair, and spoke about 20 minutes, and then the Presbyterian<br/>
spoke. George A. had informed the people that there were<br/>
two other American Preachers present who would like to<br/>
address them; and, when the Presbyterian <strike>had</strike> closed, Elder</p>",

many wished to be baptised but could not on account of the mob but<br/>
some wished to be baptised notwithstanding the persecution</p>

<p>At about twelve o'clock at night I went to the<br/>
pond to baptise. It was surrounded by a desperate mob and I baptised<br/>
five persons in the midst of a shower of stones one of which hit me in<br/>
the head <strike>and</strike> ^which nearly^ knocked me down with the man whom I was baptised [baptizing]</p>

<p>The next day I baptised 3 and I rode to [[Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England|Wolver-<br/>

people gathered to witness the hanging of two men. I came as near<br/>
to the [[Stafford Jail, Stafford, Staffordshire, England|jail]] as I could and in a few minutes they came upon the<br/>
scaffold and almost immediately they were lanched into eternity</p>

<p>The gallows remained until 3' oclock when<br/>
it was removed I went into the jail and had an interview with<br/>
Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] who had been falsely imprisoned upon a warrent for<br/>
debt which had been contracted fifteen years before he left [[England|England]]<br/>
and which he supposed was settled</p>

<p>I spent the night with brother [[William Hulme|Hulme]] and<br/>

Rigdon]]. He laid before them their situation as to temporal things said<br/>
that the Gentiles were besieging the Saints and would gladly starve them to<br/>
death; that the Presidency had used every means for the deliverance of the <br/>
Church; but that as many of the Church had refused [[Kirtland Safety Society|Kirtland]] currency which<br/>
was designed for our temporal salvation they had put strength into the<br/>
hands of our enemies and thus the community must suffer by it.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] then arose and like the Lion of the Tribe of Judah<br/>
poured out his soul in the midst of the congregation of Saints. While<br/>
listening I thought ""Who can find language to write his words and teachings<br/>
as with an iron pen in a rock that they might stand for future generations<br/>
to look upon."" He seemed a fountain of knowledge from whose mouth<br/>
streams of eternal wisdom flowed; and ^as^ he stood before the people<br/>
he showed that the authority of God was upon him. When speaking<br/>
of those who had professed to be his friends and the friends of<br/>
humanity but who had turned traitors opposed the curancy and<br/>
consequently the prosperity of [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] he proclaimed that the Lord<br/>
would severely deal with. Joseph uttered the feelings of his soul<br/>
in pain whie viewing the poverty and afflictions of the Saints<br/>
and in finding false brethren like whitened ^sepulcher^ whose course brings<br/>
perils upon the Church. [##Matthew 23:27##] Joseph is a father to Ephraim and<br/>
to all Israel in these last days and he mourned because of<br/>
unbelief and the negligence manifested by many who have received<br/>
the Gospel and be feared lest but few be left of those in Kirtland<br/>
to recieve an inheritance. I wrote in my journal of this day,<br/>
""There is not so great a man as Joseph standing in this generation.<br/>
The Gentiles look upon him and he is like a bed of gold concealed<br/>
from human view. They know not his principle his spirit,<br/>
his wisdom his virtue his philanthropy nor his calling. His<br/>
mind like [[Enoch (OT)|Enoch's]] expands as eternity and only God can<br/>
comprehend his soul.</p>

against us.</p>

down into the earth we entered the archway on the left 1120 ft.<br/>
of which was finished. It was beautifully lighted up with gas. We<br/>
walked through the Tunnel with the River Thames and the shipping<br/>
over our heads and in some places there is not more than<br/>
fifteen feet between the top of the arch and the bed of the river<br/>
There are two archways running the whole length of the tunnel<br/>
with openings affording free communication from one archway<br/>
to the other: At the time we visited the Tunnel it was<br/>
considered of the kind one of the most gigantic and wonderful<br/>
of human achievements. Visitors to this place of note in after<br/>
years are familiar with a grand Bazar not there at the time<br/>
we visited it and [[Thames Tunnel, London, Middlesex, England|Thames Tunnel]] purchases of Jewelry toys and<br/>
fancy things are carried away by the visitors to all parts of<br/>
the world as curiosities of association with one of the wonderful<br/>
places of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and momentoes of their purchasers visits to the<br/>
great Tunnel under the monarch of [[England|England's]] rivers.</strike></p>

<p><strike>About under <strike>In</strike> the centre of the River Thames we wrote<br/>
in a record our names professions and residences and when<br/>
we came out we went to the [[Tower of London, London, Middlesex, England|Tower of London]] in a boat, the<br/>
distance being about 2 miles. We did not spend much<br/>
time here for it was getting late and we could not<br/>
therefore go through all the different appartments</strike></p>

<p><strike>Next day</strike> ^On the 2nd of Sept^ I was quite ill. I had been<br/>
unwell for several days but now I was obliged to keep to<br/>
my room; but Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] went into the<br/>
City to visit the people and found some who hearkened<br/>
to them favourably. We had by this time found that<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] was the hardest place for a mission ^that^ <strike>which</strike> we had<br/>
ever undertaken, but we did not feel discouraged in the<br/>
least; and were determined in the name of the Lord to set<br/>
up the standard of the Kingdom in that city</p>

<p>The following day I was still confined to<br/>
my room most of the time but on the next Elders Kimball<br/>
and Smith went to [[Deptford, London, Middlesex, England|Debtford]], and I took a walk into the<br/>
city called upon Brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]] and found him in good <br/>
spirits. I also called upon [[Mr. Panther|Mr Panther]], 17 Warf, City Road,<br/>

into the Quorum of the Twelve [[Hiram Clark, b. 1795|Hyrum Clark]] was appointed<br/>
Counsellor to Elder [[Joseph Fielding|Fielding]] in the Presidency in the place<br/>
of brother Willard.</p>

<p>Upon motion from Elder Fielding seconded<br/>
by [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] it was determined that a [[hymn book|Hymn book]]<br/>
be published and farther motioned that it be done under<br/>
the direction of the Twelve. A monthly periodical was<br/>
also proposed.</p>

<p>Several ordinations were attended to<br/>
in the afternoon's Council.</p>

<p>[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] laid before the<br/>
conference the importance and propriety of ordaining a<br/>
Patriarch to give [[patriarchal blessings|Patriarchal blessings]] to the fatherless and to<br/>
the Saints according to the dictation of the Spirit</p>

<p>After various remarks [[John Bleagard|Bleazard]] [[James Corbridge|Corbridge]]<br/>
was chosen by the Twelve to fill the Patriarchal office and<br/>
President Fielding and his Counsellors <strike>pro</strike>ordained him.</p>

<p>On motion by Brigham Young seconded<br/>
by [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] it was agreed that the next Conference should be<br/>
held on the 6th of July at [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] but it was subsequently<br/>
arranged to be held at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]].</p>

<p>The next ^day^ the <time datetime=""",04/16/1840
42828.0,194,,""">16th of April</time> the Council<br/>
of the Twelve held its last sitting prior to the adjournment</p>

<p>Brigham Young proposed and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]<br/>
^seconded^ that Parley P. Pratt be chosen as the Editor of the monthly periodical<br/>
for the Church. Elder Kimball moved and P. P. Pratt seconded<br/>
that a committee of three be appointed to make a selection of<br/>
Hymns and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] proposed and Willford Woodruff<br/>
seconded that Brigham Young P. P. Pratt and John Taylor<br/>
be that Committee</p>

<p>Elder Willard Richards proposed that<br/>
the name of the periodical be the <strike>Latter-day</strike><br/>

which would ^hold^ 500 and that I might have that on Sunday. So<br/>
I gave out an appointment at Bowl Court 137 Thornditch. I<br/>
conversed with several others who received my testimony<br/>
and one woman said she would be baptized</p>

<p><strike>I returned home by the way of [[Smithfield, City of London, England|Smithfield's]]<br/>
market which covers about 20 acres of ground. It was<br/>
Fair time and I never saw such a sight before. There<br/>
were 20 acres of ground covered with cattle sheep and<br/>
caravans of beast of every name and large bands of music<br/>
belonging to these ""Shows"" were playing to call the people<br/>
to the exhibitions of the numerous manageries which had<br/>
gathered from all parts of the country to the Smith field<br/>
Market Fair. There was also a conglomeration of everything<br/>
there. I thought, ""Could a Missourian from the western<br/>
wiles of America whose Knowledge estended only to his<br/>
gun, corn, crib and hog-pen behold such a shight he<br/>
would think himself in another world and perhaps retire<br/>
heart-sickened with the sense as I did; and no man who<br/>
loved virtue peace and retirement could feel otherwise in<br/>
viewing a scene like the Smith field Market Fair. Yet<br/>
Fairs are yearly he<strike>n</strike>ld in every part of the nation and in<br/>
fact they form one of the venerable institutions of the<br/>
land. They are some of the ""good old English relics"" and<br/>
are strikingly pictorial of ""Merry England"" of olden times<br/>
^English^ Fairs are more plebian and belong more exclusively to the<br/>
peasantry and lower classes them English ""Races."" The latter<br/>
through just as much a national institution of the peasantry<br/>
and masses of England as the former also is a national institution<br/>
with the higher classes. The English Race course is not only<br/>
crowded with the tens of thousands of plebian <strike>stock</strike> ^fully folk^ but <strike>thee</strike> <br/>
crowds of mobility fashionable society and sportsman from<br/>
all the country around will be there gathered on race days<br/>
But English Fairs and English Races ^take^ from a moral point of<br/>
view are about on a level and there are none of the old<br/>
national institutions of that country so illustrative of the<br/>
type of ""Merry England"" in olden times. They are in<br/>
fact pictorial to the last shade of colouring when viewed</strike></p>",

<p>On motions from [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] seconded by<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] it was determined that the Saints<br/>
who desired to emigrate should receive a recommend from the Church<br/>
in [[Great Britain|Britian]] to the Church in America and that no one should<br/>
be recommended to go to America who had money unless they<br/>
assisted the poor according to the coun<strike>i</strike>sel of the Twelve.</p>

<p>[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] motioned that the copyright of<br/>
the [[Book of Mormon|Books of Mormon]] and [[Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and covenants]] be secured<br/>
as soon as possible. Parley P. Pratt sustained the motion;<br/>
and Willford Woodruff farther moved that <strike>Heber C. </strike>Brigham Young<br/>
Heber Kimball and Parley be the committee to secure the copyright<br/>
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] sustained this motion</p>

<p>Heber C. Kimball proposed and Willard<br/>
Richards seconded that Elder [[Peter Melling|Peter Melling]] be ordained an Evangelical<br/>
Minister in [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]].</p>

<p>It was also proposed by Willard Richards<br/>
and seconded by Willford Woodruff that the Editor of the [[Latter Day Saints|Millenial<br/>
Star]] keep an account of all the receipts &amp;c connected with printing<br/>
and general expences and that the books at all times be open to<br/>
the inspection of the council of the Twelve.</p>

<p>All the foregoing resolutions were unaminously<br/>
adopted.</p>

<p>The total number of the Saints in [[England|England]]<br/>
and [[Scotland|Scotland]] were 1671 including the Priesthood. The official<br/>

been convened three days. I felt happy to have the privilege<br/>
of sitting with my brethren of the Twelve to consult upon<br/>
the establishing of the [[work of God|work of God]] among the nations and<br/>

Smithfield Market Fair as viewed by me that day was one of these<br/>
pictorials of the merry days of yore. It is years this scene was<br/>

<p>Visit to [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]]</p>

<p>September the 5th Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] and<br/>
myself visited the Westminster Abbey. Here going through<br/>
every appartment we saw all the [[tomb|toomes]] and monuments<br/>
of the Kings Queens Princes Lords and noted men who have<br/>
ever been entombed within its walls.</p>

<p>One part of the Abbey was built in the<br/>
year 600 and has now stood over 1200 years. Most of<br/>
the kings and queens of England are entoombed in<br/>
Westminister Abbey who have died during those twelve<br/>
centuries.</p>

<p>Here we saw what are esteemed perfect<br/>
likeness of Queen's [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and [[Anne of Great Britain|Ann]], Lord<br/>
[[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and others. We saw the full coronation<br/>
dress of Queen Ann and also the chair in which [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Queen<br/>
Victoria]] and all the kings and queens for the last eight<br/>
hundred years were crowned. This chair of State is<br/>
covered with gold tissue and it contains a stone under<br/>
the seat in which all the Scottish chiefs and [[Scotland|Scotland's]]<br/>
Kings were crowned since they were a people. Fabulous<br/>

<p>[twelve blank lines]</p>

<p>As I am now entering upon that<br/>
part of my labours in the English mission where I became<br/>
associated with more of my brethren the Twelve in our<br/>
ministry in a foreign land I will here open a new<br/>
chapter by a brief<br/>
Summary View<br/>
of<br/>
My Mission in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]<br/>
prior to the Council at [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]].</p>

<p>Being led by the Spirit I visited<br/>
[[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] Herefordshire on the <time datetime=""",03/05/1840
42828.0,196,,""">5th day of March 1840</time><br/>
and commenced preaching the [[word of God|word of God]] unto the people and<br/>
many received my testimony.<br/>
I commenced baptizing &amp; In one month and five days I<br/>
had baptised 158 souls.</p>

<p>I baptized Mr [[Thomas Kington|Thomas Kington]]<br/>
the Superintendant of the Church of [[United Brethren|United Brethren]] which<br/>
came out of the Methodist connection. I also baptized<br/>
forty-eight preachers of the United Brethren and one hundred</p>",
42828.0,244,,"<p>held at meeting in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle square]], at 3 o'clock, in the <br/>
afternoon on which Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] preached and<br/>
I bore my testimony to their words. One man arose<br/>
and opposed us, and was angry because of the truth of<br/>
God. He continued opposing, until the police stoped<br/>
the conversation.</p>

<p>We met again in the evening at Bowl<br/>
Court, to preach to the people, but when we got there we<br/>
found a plan contrived by several of the preachers for<br/>
one of them to preach, lest some should beleive our<br/>
testimony. <strike>When we found this</strike>, We went our way and<br/>
found four persons who received our testimony and<br/>
offered themselves for baptism</p>

<p>Next day I wrote to Elder [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] of<br/>
my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] field of labour and walked to Bro<br/>
[[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] and visited several other friends. Two offered<br/>
themselves for baptism. I visited [[The Church of St. Paul, Liverpool, Lancashire, England|St Paul's]] and then<br/>
returned home. Elders Kimball and Smith had<br/>
just returned from</p>

<p>A Visit to the Rev. [[Robert Aitken|Robert Aitken]]</p>

<p>He received them kindly, acknowledged their<br/>
doctrine true, but was affraid of deception. His mind<br/>
was in a disturbed state.</p>

<p>In the evening we held a meeting in<br/>
the Temperance Hall; but we had almost the bare<br/>
walls to preach to, there being only about thirty present<br/>
I preached to the few present for about an hour, and<br/>
Elder Kimball followed me. After paying 7/6/ seven shillings<br/>
and six pence for the use of the hall we returned to our<br/>
lodgings.</p>

<p><strike>Part of the next day we spent in<br/>
visiting places and things connected with the crown. We<br/>
started out together and walked to King St. and Union<br/>
St. and passed by [[Surrey Chapel, Southwark, Middlesex, England|Surry Chapel]] which was built and<br/>
occupied for many years by the celebrated [[Rowland Hill|Rowland Hill]]<br/>
whose body lies under this chapel</strike></p>

<p><strike>From thence we continued to [[Westminster Bridge, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster<br/>
Bridge]] which brought us direct to [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]]</strike></p>",
42828.0,197,1840-04-14,"<p>and twelve of the members of that Church.</p>

<p>This threw into my hands under my<br/>
superintendence forty-two places of worship already established<br/>
and licensed according to law including one regular chapel.</p>

<p>When I left this vast field of labour to<br/>
attend Conference at [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] there was ^were^ nearly 200 more persons<br/>
ready to enter into the Church; and among those already numbered<br/>
with us were the preachers of the [[United Brethren|United Brethren]] before mentioned<br/>
and one clerk of the [[Church of England|Church of England]] and a number of wealthy<br/>
farmers</p>

<p>This opened the largest field of labour<br/>
and was the greatest increase of the Church in the British<br/>
Mission and when I left this vast field of labour to go to<br/>
Preston to attend Conference there were nearly two hundred<br/>
more souls ready to be baptized as soon as an opportunity<br/>
offered of whom after my return I found that Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]]<br/>
had baptized ten and Priest [[John Cheese|John Cheese]] twenty making<br/>
the number of souls belonging to the Church in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]<br/>
one hundred and eighty eight. I will now again take up<br/>
the regular thread of my history from my daily journal<br/>
for 1840.</p>

<p>I had spent the <time datetime=""",04/14/1840

42828.0,197,1840-04-17,""">16th</time> of April<br/>
sitting in Council with my brethren the Twelve and the Saints<br/>
who <strike>g</strike>had come up to this general conference of the British<br/>
Mission; and on the evening of the <strike>20</strike>^15^th I preached in the<br/>
Temperence Hall to a crowded congregation</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/17/1840
42828.0,197,,""">17th</time> being [[Good Friday|Good Friday]] the Twelve<br/>
met at [[Penwortham, Lancashire, England|Penworthham]] two miles from Preston to visit the<br/>
Saints and spend the day together before they seperated for<br/>
their several fields of labour. Sister Moon opened a bottle<br/>
of wine for us to bless and partake of. This bottle of wine<br/>
she had kept for forty years. After spending the day<br/>
in conversing about the things of the [[kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] we<br/>
returned to Preston.</p>

<p>The time had come for the Twelve to seperate<br/>
and go into different parts of the [[vineyard of the Lord|Lord's vinyard]]. It was<br/>
thought widsom for Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimble]] to visist the Churches<br/>
which he had built up while in [[England|England]] on his former</p>",
42828.0,245,,"<p>and the House of Parliament. We walked through</p>

<p>the House of Lords and Commons</p>

<p>of [[England|England]] and sat  in the chair in which the speakers of the house<br/>
of Lords had sat for many years. In this room all the<br/>
speeches were made by that great orator [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] concerning<br/>
America before the [[American Revolution|revolution]]. As the House of Commons<br/>
was burned down about six years before our visit this room<br/>
was then occupied by the Commons and there was another<br/>
house built for the Lords at that time</p>

<p>One would naturally suppose that a<br/>
room fitted up to contain the Lords and Commons of<br/>
England would be extraordinary grand and expensive but<br/>
it is quite the reverse being exceedingly plain and undecorated</p>

<p>On entering the room one would sooner<br/>
think he was in an American School House than in<br/>
the House of the Lords of England</p>

<p>Next we visited St James Park and<br/>
saw a company of two hundred foot soldiers the Grenadier<br/>
Gards on parade accompanied by a fine martial band<br/>
Afterwards we saw the Queen's Horse Guards on parade<br/>
one hundred in number with their bodies covered<br/>
with steel which shone right martially. They wore<br/>
helmets and breastplates of steel which glistening in the<br/>
sun's rays made them appear as though they were encased<br/>
in polished armour; and they were mounted on powerful<br/>
black mares whose glosy coats and high mettle well<br/>
became the pride and pomp of war. It would be hard<br/>
to convince an Englishman that the Queen's Horse Guards<br/>
was not the finest regiment in the world. The charge<br/>
of the Guards at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] is immortalized by the Wellingtonian<br/>
household tradition of ""Up Guards and at them"" which won<br/>
that famous battle upon which the destiny of [[Europe|Europe]] hung<br/>
and gave to the Iron Duke the crown of glory as Conquerer<br/>
of [[Napoleon Bonaparte of France|Napoleon]] the Great. We may be told by those<br/>
who are sceptical to popular traditions that the great<br/>
[[Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington|Duke]] never uttered this famous command and we may <br/>
read that Iron Duke himself was doubtful of the tradition still<br/>
the masses will beleive it and the ""Up Guards and at them!""</p>",

[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] to proceed to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and publish the<br/>
[[Latter Day Saints|Millennial Star]]. (After years revealed that this new<br/>
periodical which was the first Church organ of foreign missions<br/>
was destined to live through many volumes and probably<br/>
will continue to be (as in 1865) the oldest periodical and<br/>
official organ in the Church. At the date of this transcript<br/>
it has passed through the hands of numerous editors and<br/>
has reached its twenty seventh volume.)</p>

<p>It was further arranged by the Twelve<br/>
that Elder [[George Albert Smith|G A Smith]] should go to the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|poteries]] and<br/>
Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham ^Young^]] and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] go with me into<br/>
the field of labour which I had opened in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] and<br/>
the adjoining country</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/18/1840
42828.0,198,,""">18th</time> I parted from the rest of<br/>
the Twelve who were to branch out in other directions<br/>
and with Brigham Young started on my return to my<br/>
fields of labour. We took train a^nd^ journied to Manchester<br/>
and then continued by coach to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] where we spent<br/>
the night at brother Johnstons</p>

<p>Next day being Sunday Elder [[Brigham Young|B.<br/>
Young]] preached to the people of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] in the morning<br/>
and evening and in the afternoon we communed with<br/>
the Saints and spent an interesting time. We spent<br/>
the night at [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] with Brother [[William Hulme|Hulme]].</p>

<p>The following day we took coach at<br/>
Stoke and rode to [[Stafford, Staffordshire, England|Stafford]] and thence to [[Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England|Wolverhampton]]<br/>
where we stayed for the night and on the morrow we<br/>
proceeded by coach to [[Dudley, Staffordshire, England|Dudly]] and had a good view of the<br/>
old Dudly castle and from thence to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] in which<br/>
city we spent several hours.</p>

<p>Here we visited the ancient and noted<br/>
<u>Worcester</u> <u>Cathedral</u> which surpassed for splendor and<br/>
archetecture anything which I had ever viewed. Its length<br/>
is about 400 feet and this magnificient structure is between<br/>

tradition with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelsons]] ""[[England|England]] expects every man this day<br/>

most certainly a magnificient regiment any how. They are<br/>
to the English Army what [[Napoleon Bonaparte of France|Napoleons]] ""Old Guard"" was to the<br/>
^French^ but while the ""Old Guard"" of the Emperor was broken forever<br/>
at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], the Horse Guards of the grand Willingtonian<br/>
charge lived to do splendid service and maintain their<br/>
prestige in after years in the Crimean war fighting side<br/>
by side with the French whose Imperial head was<br/>
still a [[Napoléon III of France|Napoleon]] as before This time they were alies<br/>
and not foes yet then the French won from the English<br/>
some of the Glory lost at Waterloo in spite of the fact<br/>
that the Queens Guards and the crack regiments of England<br/>
never behaved better, for instance that madly brilliant<br/>
Balaclavia charge at the Light Horse of the English army<br/>
In viewing and visitng th famous things and places of<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] I always felt interested in their historical associations<br/>
and reminenscences</strike></p>

<p><strike>Passing from the martial view of the<br/>
Queens Horse Guards we visited the monument errected<br/>
in honour of the Duke of York which was 135 feet in<br/>
height. Here I parted from Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] and<br/>
walked the whole length of [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St James' Park]]. It has a<br/>
fine pond in the centre and mansions and palaces<br/>
around.</strike></p>

<p><strike>I first visited the palace of the<br/>
Queen Dowager [[Adelaide of the United Kingdom|widow]] of [[William IV of England|William]] the Fourth next the<br/>
mansion of the Duke of <strike>Sumerset</strike> ^Somerset^ which was quite<br/>
splendid and then [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]]. This palace<br/>
was occupied by Her Majesty Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Victoria]] and His Highness<br/>
Prince [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, b. 1819|Albert]]. It covers a number of acres of ground<br/>
and every door enterance and gate was strongly guarded by<br/>
armed soldiers</strike></p>

<p><strike>I walked nearly around this palace and<br/>
while doing so I had the privilege of seeing</strike></p>

up mobs against the Saints which had in several instances much<br/>
disturbed the meetings</p>

<p>On the 16 I had joined Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] in<br/>
[[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] and that evening we were to hold at his house the<br/>
weekly prayer meeting of the Branch.</p>

<p>As we began to gather together the beating<br/>
of drums and kettles were heard through the street and the<br/>
mob soon collected and paraded in front of the house<br/>
We closed the window and shutters and doors in the house and<br/>
I opened the meeting with singing and prayer</p>

<p>But we had no sooner commenced than<br/>
the mob armed themselves with rocks bricks eggs and any<br/>
thing they could lay their hands upon and began to throw<br/>
them at the house like a shower of hailstones for nearly<br/>
an hour. They dashed in the windows scattered bricks and<br/>
glass through the rooms broke the tiles of the roof and<br/>
continued such depredations until the close of the meeting<br/>
The brethren being disposed to test the virtue of the laws<br/>
which were strict against such outrages I proposed to<br/>
go into the midst of the mob to see who they were but<br/>
they would not permit me lest I should receive injury<br/>
from the shower of stones. Several of the brethren<br/>
however went themselves and took down the names of<br/>
the leaders and returned to the house in the midst of a<br/>
volley of stones and brik-bats but without injury. Soon <br/>
afterwards the mob broke up and having cleared the room<br/>
of the bricks stones and glass we laid down to rest<br/>
and had a good night</p>

<p>I was at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] on the 18th<br/>
and found the Saints in good spirits and learned that<br/>
Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] had sailed from [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] on the 8th with a<br/>
company of 200 saints. [[John Benbow|Brother]] and Sister [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Benbow]]<br/>
and the rest of the emigrant company were rejoicing in the<br/>
Lord and in their Zion bound journey</p>

<p>The 20th was well spent and was an<br/>
interesting day. I preached at Froom's Hill and communed with<br/>
the Saints and also at Standly Hill.</p>",

<p>This cathedral contains many monuments<br/>
and marble sculptured figures over the toombs of ancient Bishops<br/>
Lords and Princes some of whom had laid there for seven<br/>
or eight hundred years. It is said that some of these monuments<br/>
with their marble sepulchre drapery are as neatly executed as any<br/>
found in [[Europe|Europe]]. Almost everything about this magnificient<br/>
c<strike>h</strike>athedral from the dome to the basement is carved out of solid<br/>
marble. The pulpit is also hewn from solid stone. There<br/>
is a large organ in the building and the [[Church of England|Church of England]]<br/>
hold service in it twice each day in the year. We staid during <br/>
one service.</p>

<p>From [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] we rode to [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]] and<br/>
on the road we passed through the town of [[Malvern, Worcestershire, England|Malvern]] on<br/>
[[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]] which commands the splendid prospect<br/>
of all the surrounding country for thirty miles on some<br/>
of the highest peaks of which are large entrenchments where<br/>
men retreted in the time of the Roman invasion. The <br/>
buildings in the village of Malvern are fine and very<br/>
picturesque in appearence standing on the side of these<br/>
^hills^ Malvern is a noted place which the nobility and gentry<br/>
of [[England|England]] visit in the Summer season. We had<br/>
a view of Eastner castle as we past along. That night<br/>
we spent at Mr [[Francis Pullen|Francis Pullins]] in Ledbury</p>

<p>On the next day we walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's<br/>
Hill]] and called upon brother [[John Benbow|John Benbow]] and had an<br/>
interview with Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]]. In the evening we held a<br/>
Church meeting at [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Stan^d^ly Hill]] to do Church business. This<br/>
was the first meeting at which [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] was<br/>
present in this district of country and I will therefore subjoin<br/>

a grey horse followed by his groom and was not accompanied by<br/>
[[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Her]] Majesty or any other person. He was dressed in a frock coat<br/>
and dark pants. He looked fresh and healthy and in the<br/>
young spring of life being only twenty years of age. I did not<br/>
see Queen Victoria for she was at [[Windsor Castle, Windsor, Berkshire, England|Windsor Castle]] at this time.</strike></p>

<p><strike>I next visited the [[National Gallery, Westminster, Middlesex, England|National Gallery]] and<br/>
viewed its choice and extensive collection of the best paintings of<br/>
the great masters of the art and afterwards St Martin's Church<br/>
when I concluded that I had seen as much as my brain could<br/>
contain for one day. Three miles walk farther through<br/>
the city brought me to Brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] where I again joined<br/>
Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]]. We spent a little time with the<br/>
friends and returned to our lodgings and spent the night.</strike></p>

<p>My Return to [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]</p>

<p><strike>Next day</strike> ^On^ September the 9th I paid my bills and <br/>
called upon the friends, in company of brothers Kimball and Smith,<br/>
and the day following I parted from the brethren and friends<br/>
in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] to return to Herefordshire.</p>

<p>We had spent twenty three days in<br/>
that great Babylon of modern times and had found it harder<br/>
to establish the Church there, than in any place where<br/>
we had ever been. We had baptized one man, and ordained<br/>
him a priest; and six others had given in their names to<br/>
be baptized on the following Sunday; and at this time<br/>
there was some little prospect of the Reverend [[Robert Aitken|Robert Aitken]]<br/>
receiving the work. I, therefore, left London feeling that<br/>
our mission and labours had not been altogether in vain</p>

<p><strike>I took the omnibus three miles<br/>
to the Great Western Railway Padington and at 9 o'clock<br/>
started for Herefordshire, and as I passed Windsor Castle and<br/>
saw the British flag flying from it as signal that her<br/>
Majesty was there.</strike></p>

<p><strike>Arriving at Cheltenham at 4 o'clock<br/>

was called for. This being given Elder Kington was<br/>
appointed to represent this Conference at the General<br/>
Conference of the British Mission at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] Oct 6, 1840<br/>
The representation of the Branches of the Froom's Hill<br/>
Conference was as follows:</p>",

to the office of Priest and John Benbow to the office of Teacher<br/>

and Wilford Woodruff then proceeded to ordain them to<br/>
the offices assigned to them. Priest Charles Price was also<br/>
chosen clerk of the [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|^Standly^ Hill]] Branch of the Church. The<br/>
meeting closed by prayer after which we walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's<br/>
Hill]] and spent the night.</p>

<p>On the next day Elder Young and myself<br/>
walked to [[Moorends Cross, Malton, Worcestershire, England|Moorend Cross]] and called upon Brother [[Thomas Jenkins|Thomas<br/>
<strike>Kington</strike> ^Jinkins^]]. We both had a bad cold and felt ill<br/>
I left Brother Young and went to [[Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Colwall]] on the side<br/>
of [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]] and preached. Before the meeting I<br/>
ascended to the top of the Hill and took an interesting survey<br/>
of the surrounding country. I returned to brother <strike>[[Thomas Kington|Kington's]]</strike> ^Jinkins^<br/>
and spent the night</p>

<p>The following day was occupied in writing<br/>
Brother Brigham wrote a letter to his [[Mary Ann Angell Young|wife]] in which I enclosed a<br/>
few lines to [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]. I also wrote a seperate letter to her and sent<br/>
it to [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] Illinois. I preached at Brother Jinkins where I stayed<br/>
that night and was quite ill as I was also the next day and night</p>

the morrow the <time datetime=""",04/26/1840

preached at Mr [[John Bailey|Baily's]] and in the afternoon I walked to<br/>
<strike>G</strike>[[Crowcutt, Worcestershire, England|Crowcutt]] where I preached and baptized and confirmed ten<br/>
persons. One of those whom I baptized was a preacher. I<br/>
<strike>called and</strike> ^also^ ordained [[Edward Phillips|Edward Philips]] to the office of Priest. I returned<br/>
to Moorend Cross and passed the night at Brother Jinkins<br/>
having walked that day a distance of 12 miles and held two<br/>
meetings. Elder Young to day baptized four at Froom's Hill.<br/>
Thus the work of the Lord continued to advance in this<br/>
district of country.</p>

<p>On the <time datetime=""",04/27/1840

cold but I preached at Moorend Cross and baptized and confirmed</p>",
42828.0,248,,"<p>I was rejoiced on my return to the Churches to find that<br/>
the work was universally and rapidly progressing in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]<br/>
In some cases it was even reaching the nobility, and a lady<br/>
of title had become convinced of the work of God <strike>in</strike> ^through^ our<br/>
ministry.</p>

<p>On the 12th, two days after my<br/>
return I wrote from [[Leigh, Lancashire, England|Leigh]] a historical letter to Elder<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] including my travels with him in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]<br/>
This was the first letter I had ever written to him</p>

<p>The next day Sunday I met the<br/>
Saints at Leigh and communed with them and at<br/>
a neighbouring place preached in the afternoon at<br/>
2 o'clock to a large congregation. In the evening I again<br/>
preached at Leigh and 4 were baptized by Elder [[Henry Glover|Glover]]<br/>
and I confirmed them</p>

<p>The minutes were then read and accepted<br/>
and afterwards exhortations given by the Elders and then<br/>
the Conference adjourned till Dec. 14th 1840. Benediction from W. Woodruff.</p>",
42828.0,254,,"<p>These two Conferences, with their forty branch<br/>
churches, and over a thousand organized members, under<br/>
the direction of one hundred and thirteen ordained officers,<br/>
had been raised up <strike>in</strike>within six months and a half. Surely<br/>
the work of God had been marvellous, unparalleled<br/>
perhaps in the history of any new religious movement,<br/>
unparalleled in the foundation of Christian Churches of<br/>
every denomination either in ancient or modern times<br/>
To God the Giver of the power and efficacy of our<br/>
administration of the Gospel in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] and regions<br/>
around be the glory and not unto the humble ministers<br/>
of that work</p>

<p>I meditated upon these things and<br/>
in my journal of date Sept 21st 1840 I wrote thus:</p>

<p>""This has been a busy day with me. After<br/>
standing upon my feet from morning till evening I am<br/>
called to shake hands with hundreds of Saints with glad<br/>
hearts and cheerful countenances. It is with no ordinary<br/>
feelings that I meditate upon the cheering fact that<br/>
a thousand souls have been baptized into the New<br/>
and Everlasting Covenant in about half a year in one field<br/>
which God has enabled me to open. I pray Him to accept<br/>
the gratitude of my heart for his mercies and blessings<br/>
unto me in this thing and enable me to stand with<br/>
these Saints and all the righteous in His Celestial Kingdom""</p>

<p>This day I had stood upon my feet<br/>
eight hours in conference conversed much of the time in suggesting<br/>
speeking motioning &amp;c; ordained about 30 confirmed some healed<br/>
many who were sick shook hands with about 400 Saints<br/>
walked 2 miles and ended with 4 hours of chimney corner<br/>
preaching. I then laid down to rest and dreamt of<br/>
catching fish.</p>

<p>Next day I was called upon to visit<br/>
a young man who lay dangerously ill and in danger<br/>
of the lockjaw from a cut of the ancle and bruise<br/>
of the knee. I rebuked the inflamation and pain of<br/>
the body and he was made whole. I baptized<br/>
[[Edward Jones|Edward Jones]] a Game keeper and confirmed two</p>",
42828.0,250,,"<p>Next day I walked from [[Turkey Hall, Eldersfield, Worcestershire, England|Turkey Hall]] to [[Redmarley D|Forty Green]]<br/>
and wrote a letter to [[Lady Roberts|Lady Roberts]] a companion of the<br/>
lady of [[Squire Dowdswell|Squire Dowdswell]] and sent it by the hand<br/>
of sister Brooks.</p>

<p>Lady Roberts was of the nobility of<br/>
[[England|England]] and a lady of wealth, and had withdrawn<br/>
from the Church of England and the travelled much<br/>
in search of truth looking for the fulfilment of the<br/>
Prophets.</p>

<p>She became acquainted with the fulness<br/>
of the Gospel through a female servant in the employ<br/>
of Squire Dowdswell. She began to investigate<br/>
the subject; <strike>and</strike> the Spirit of God rested upon her<br/>
and convinced her of the truth of the work. <strike>and</strike> <strike>s</strike>She<br/>
obtained the 4 numbers published of the Millennial<br/>
Star and fearing that she should not be able to<br/>
obtain them for herself, copied the whole of them<br/>
with her pen. She also read the Book of Mormon<br/>
and copied a part of that, and became perfectly<br/>
convinced of the truth of the work of which she<br/>
read, and said she would go a thousand miles<br/>
but what she would see some of the Twelve and<br/>
be baptized under their hands. <strike>and</strike> <strike>h</strike>Hearing that<br/>
I was in London she was about to take a journey<br/>
there to see me, and the other brethren, and be baptized<br/>
She had two brothers ministers of the Church of<br/>
England.</p>

<p><strike>Having returned from London, I, therefore, <br/>
addressed her by letter upon the work of God, into which<br/>
at that time she was so earnestly entering, to which<br/>
she returned me a verbal answer by Sister Brooks, thanking<br/>
me kindly for the interest which I manifested in her welfare,<br/>
and saying that she should address me by letter in a few days</strike></p>

<p><strike>Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] in [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] had faithfully<br/>
warned the people and had succeeded in raising up a<br/>
Church of fifty saints. This had stired up the<br/>
inhabitants of that place to much anger against us<br/>
and especially the Rev. [[John Simons|John Simons]] Rector of the Church</strike></p>",
42828.0,255,,"<p>The day following I was called upon to visit another<br/>
young man who lay dangerously ill with the fever. He<br/>
covenanted to keep the commandments of God and I<br/>
anointed him and rebuked the fever and he began<br/>
to recover. I also visited an aged Saint upon her<br/>
death bed and blessed her. She was rejoicing in<br/>
the fulness of the Gospel in death</p>

<p>The Church ministers at this time were very<br/>
much stirred up in this region because of the success of the<br/>
work of God in the midst of the people and every exertion<br/>
were made by them to stay its progress. They were finding<br/>
that the Lord was delivering their flocks out of their hands<br/>
and giving them unto the Shepherds of the Church of the<br/>
Saints. They were alarmed and were holding conventions<br/>
and meetings to continue plans and adopt means to over-<br/>
throw the Latter-day Work of God which they understood<br/>
not and beleived not yet feared its power. And well<br/>
indeed they might for in some instances they did not<br/>
have more than 10 or 15 at their churches on the Sabbath<br/>
while around them on every hand they had seen forty<br/>
Branches of two organized Conferences of the Church of<br/>
Latter-Day Saints spring up in about six months with<br/>
over a thousand members and between one and two<br/>
hundred officers ordained to scatter the ^seed of the^ Gospel everwhere<br/>
<strike>upon the new broken ground of</strike> ^in^ this prolific field</p>

<p>On the 25th the time had come for<br/>
me again to take leave of the Saints in my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]<br/>
field of labour. I wrote an address to Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] baptized one and confirmed two and after<br/>
Visiting the Saints until midnight I took the parting<br/>
hand with them and started on my journey at 12 o'clock<br/>
at night.</p>

<p>I rode from [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Froom's Hill]] at night in<br/>
a cart to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] 15 miles took coach and thence 40 miles<br/>
to [[Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England|Wolverhampton]]. Here I rode 2 miles by the omnibus<br/>
to the railroad Station and travelled by rail 30 miles<br/>
to Whitmore Station where I again took omnibus 9 miles<br/>
to [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]] and then rode in a gig to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]].</p>",
42828.0,301,,"<p>of the Saints. In thy land thousands of the Saints of God <br/>
have been driven from place to place county to county and <br/>
State to State and the blood of martyrs has been spilt <br/>
for the testimony of Jesus: and when thy rulers have been <br/>
petitioned for the redress of the wrongs of the Lord's people <br/>
and thy citizens they have turned a deaf ear in their crys<br/>
Therefore O America! thou art weighed in the balance <br/>
and found wanting. From this time forth perplexity<br/>
shall rest upon thee and confusion in thy government <br/>
wisdom righteousness and truth shall depart from thy <br/>
rulers and fully sit in thy Congress and thy shame shall <br/>
be known among the nations of the earth. It shall be<br/>
a vexation to understand the report of the sorrow and<br/>
woe that shall come upon thee by sword fire tempest <br/>
earthquakes and pestilence from the hands of God <br/>
until thy government is broken up and thou art destroyed <br/>
as a nation from under Heaven. From this hour <br/>

into my hands a letter from Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]]<br/>

time. I then walked to [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]] and preached and<br/>
communed with the Saints and then returned to<br/>

the Spirit of the Lord with me.</p>

to represent the Conference of the Staffordshire Potteries at the<br/>
General Conference of the British Mission to be held at<br/>
[[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] Oct 6th 1840.</p>

<p>The Conference then adjourned till the 28th<br/>
of the next Dec. and was closed by singing and prayer</p>

<p>In the afternoon a council of the officers meet<br/>
when Willford Woodruff addressed them at length and gave<br/>
much counsel and advise. There were five baptized after<br/>
the conference meeting and the Spirit and blessing of the<br/>
Lord was with us throughout the day</p>

Clerk [[Osmond Shaw|Osmond Shaw]]</p>",
42828.0,303,,"<p>Moved by Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and seconded by Elder [[William Hill Pitt|Pitt]] that [[Richard Bates|Richard<br/>

<p>Afterwards Elder Kimball moved and <br/>
Elder Woodruff seconded that Elder Lorenzo Snow be <br/>
appointed President of this Conference and to take the <br/>
Superintendency of the Church in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]</p>

<p>Much valuable instruction was <br/>
given by Elders Kimball and Woodruff in relation to <br/>
the duties of official members and afterwards it was <br/>
moved by Elder Kimball and seconded by Elder <br/>
Snow that this conference be adjourned till Sunday <br/>
the 16 of May 1841; after which the Conference closed. <br/>
<strike>duly</strike>.</p>

<p>President Wilford Woodruff<br/>
Clerk Dr [[William Copeland|Wm. Copeland]]</p>

<p>During this Conference meeting we also broke bread<br/>
with the Saints and confirmed four at 1/2 past 1<br/>
o'clock in the evening ^we meet again^ and had the largest congregation <br/>
which had assembled at our preaching place. One came <br/>
forward for baptism</p>

<p>This was a day which we had <br/>
long desired to see for we had laboured exceedingly<br/>
hard to establish a Church in London and at <br/>
times it seemed as though we should have to give <br/>
it up but by holding on to the work of our Divine <br/>
Master and claiming the promises of God we <br/>
were now to leave an established London Conference<br/>
with a prosperous Church planted in the Metropolis <br/>
under the care of our beloved brother Lorenzo Snow</p>",
42828.0,351,,"<p>are fixed and unalterable. For instance, He set the Sun the<br/>
moon and the Stars in the heavens and gave them their laws <br/>
conditions and bounds which they cannot pass except by his <br/>
commands. They all move in perfect harmony in their sphere <br/>
and order and are as wonders lights and signs unto us</p>

<p>""The sea also has its bounds which it cannot <br/>
pass. God has set many signs in the earth as well as in <br/>
the heavens. For instance the oaks of the forest the fruit of <br/>
the tree, the herb of the field all bear a sign that seed hath <br/>
been planted there, for it is a decree of the Lord that every <br/>
tree fruit or herb bearing seed shall bring forth after its own <br/>
kind and cannot come forth after any other law.""</p>

<p>Upon the same principle do I contend that <br/>
baptism is a sign ordained of God for every believer in <br/>
Christ to take upon himself in order to enter into the <br/>
Kingdom of God. ""Except a man be born of water and of the <br/>
Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God said the <br/>
Saviur</p>

<p>""As it is a sign and commandment which <br/>
God hath set for man to enter into his Kingdom those <br/>
who seek to enter in by any other way will seek in vain<br/>
God will not receive them neither will the angels acknowledge<br/>
their work as accepted for they have not taken <br/>
upon themselves those ordinances and signs which <br/>
God ordained for men to receive in order to receive <br/>
celectial glory. God has decreed that all who will <br/>
not obey his voice shall not escape the damnation <br/>
of hell. And what is the damnation of hell? Why to go <br/>
and be numbered with that society who have not obeyed <br/>
His commands.</p>

<p>Baptism is a sign to God and to angels <br/>
and to Heaven that we do the will of the Father and there <br/>
is no other way ordained by God for man to come unto <br/>
Him and any other course is vain. It is the decree of <br/>
Heaven and ordained that man shall repent of all his sins<br/>
and be baptised for the remission of them.  Then he can <br/>
come to God in the name of Jesus Christ in faith <br/>
and obtain the promise of the Holy Ghost.""</p>",
42828.0,258,,"<p>The day after the Conference I baptized one<br/>
and preached at [[Tunstall, Staffordshire, England|Tunstell]] and on the next evening at [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]]<br/>
to a crowded audience and the power of God rested upon<br/>
me. Great solemnity pervaded the congregation. The <br/>
Spirit of God was moving the people and they felt that<br/>
the Lord was doing a work in their midst</p>

<p>October ^1st^ <strike>2</strike>nd I walked to [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]]<br/>
and thence to [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] where I found [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
who had just returned from [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. We then went to<br/>
[[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]] where we found brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]. After<br/>
partaking of food we went to the water and baptized<br/>
two and thence to the preaching room where we met an<br/>
overwhelming congregation. I testified to them of the<br/>
work of God and was followed by Elder Kimball. The<br/>
power of the Almighty was upon the people and they <br/>
felt that it was a day of warning and repentance. Six<br/>
were confirmed and three baptized</p>

<p>Next morning Elder Kimball and<br/>
myself arose from our bed with the power of God resting upon <br/>
us yea His Spirit was like fire shut up in our bones<br/>
I said</p>

<p><strike>O my God why is thy Spirit thus upon me? Why<br/>
<strike>i</strike>a<strike>s</strike>re <strike>t</strike>m<strike>h</strike>y eyes like a fountain? What art thou about to do<br/>
O my God that causes this thing? I ask thee Father<br/>
to tell it unto me in the name of Jesus Christ thy Son<br/>
And the Spirit of revelation came upon me and I was answered</strike></p>

<p>""Thus saith the Lord God unto thee my<br/>
servant Willford; This is my Spirit which resteth upon<br/>
thee to enlighten thy mind to show thee things to<br/>
come and not only upon thee but upon all my faithful<br/>
servants upon the face of the whole earth saith the Lord.<br/>
Mine indignation is about to be poured out without<br/>
mixture upon all the nations of the earth and they<br/>
shall not escape. The cry of the poor the widow<br/>
and the orphan ascendeth into mine ears saith the Lord<br/>
and I am about to avenge the cry of mine elect by<br/>
laying low the oppressor and executing the decree of<br/>
mine heart upon all the ungodly amongst men</p>",
42828.0,304,,"<p>Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] on the 15th received a letter <br/>
from his wife informing us that the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
had written for the Twelve to come immediately home <br/>
for our personal safety and the next day we met <br/>
with the Church previous to our parting with the <br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] Saints</p>

<p>Greater excitement than ever prevailed <br/>
throughout London and specially in the House of <br/>
Parliament over the imprisonment of [[Alexander McLeod|M. C. Cleod]] <br/>
and the North Eastern Boundary question and <br/>
Government secured determined on war and to every <br/>
appearence hostilities between [[England|England]] and America <br/>
seemed almost certin and it appeared as much <br/>
^as^ we should do to sail from [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] before war <br/>
broke out</p>

<p>I received a letter from Elder [[William Hill Pitt|Wm<br/>
Pitt]] containing 3 pounds and informing me that <br/>
there was an appointment for me to preach in <br/>
[[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]] on the Sunday</p>

<p>Dr [[William Copeland|Copeland]] introduced us by <br/>
letter to the Overseer of the Library of Bartholimew <br/>
Hospital which we visited and was very politely <br/>
conducted by [[Dr. Lyon|Dr Lyon]] through the various<br/>
departments of the Hospital and after visiting the <br/>
Museum Lecture Rooms and other places we last <br/>
of all visited the Dissecting Rooms where there ^were^ about <br/>
twenty human bodies which the doctors were dissecting</p>

<p>On the same day I corrected <br/>
the proof sheet of our Address to the citizens of London <br/>
and in the evening our sitting room was full of Saints<br/>
as we were soon to leave London and they brought us <br/>
some money and presents for our wives and children</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we baptized <br/>
a Jew and Jewess.</p>

<p>I was unwell that night and arose next <br/>
morning quite ill but walked to the printing office <br/>
and got three throusand copies of our Address to the <br/>
Citizens of London for which I paid three guineas</p>",
42828.0,352,,"<p>""What is the sign of the healing of the sick?<br/>
The laying on of hands is the sign marked by [[James (NT)|James]] <br/>
and the custom of the ancient Saints as ordained by the <br/>
Lord; and we shall not obtain the blessing by pursuing <br/>
any other course than that which God hath marked out.</p>

<p>What if we should attempt to obtain the Holy <br/>
Ghost through any other means except the sign or <br/>
w<strike>h</strike>ay which God has appointed?  Should we obtain <br/>
it? Certainly not. All other means would fail. The <br/>
Lord says do so and so and I will give the blessing<br/>
There are certain key words and signs belonging to the <br/>
Priesthood which must be observed in order to obtain <br/>
the blessings</p>

<p>The sign of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] was to repent and <br/>
be baptised for remission of sins with the promise <br/>
of the gift of the Holy Ghost; and in no other way is <br/>
the gift of the Holy Ghost obtained</p>

<p>There is a difference between the <br/>
Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. [[Cornelius (NT)|Cornelius]]<br/>
received the Holy Ghost before he was baptised which <br/>
was the convincing power of God unto him, of the <br/>
truth of the Gospel; but he could not receive the <u>gift </u><br/>
of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptised. Had <br/>
he not taken this sign, this ordinance upon himself <br/>
the Holy Spirit which convinced him of the truth of <br/>
God would have left him until he had obeyed the <br/>
ordinance of baptism and received the gift of the Holy <br/>
Ghost by the laying on of hands according to the order <br/>
of God he could not have healed the sick nor commanded <br/>
an evil spirit to come out of a person and be obeyed for <br/>
the Spirit might say to him as to the sons of Seeney <br/>
Peter I know and [[Paul (NT)|Paul]] I know and Jesus I know but who <br/>
are you?</p>

<p>It mattereth not whether we live long <br/>
or short after we come to a knowledge of the principles<br/>
of the Gospel and obey them. I know that all men will<br/>
be damned if they do not come in the way which God </p>",
42828.0,259,,"<p>Therefore I put my Spirit upon thee and say unto thee, Lift<br/>
up they voice and spare not and call upon all men to<br/>
repent that come within the sound of thy voice and<br/>
many souls shall be given unto thee and great shall<br/>
be they reward and eternal shall be they glory saith<br/>
the Lord""</p>

<p>The people were much stirred up throughout<br/>
the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] and felt as they never felt before. I walked to<br/>
[[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] and preached to the people and the power of God rested upon<br/>
us. Three were baptized and confirmed</p>

<p>On the 5th I took coach in company of Elders<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Brother Kneadham|Needham]] for [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]. <strike>I had a touch of the<br/>
ague on the way and had</strike> of the cholera the day before</p>

<p><strike>When I</strike> <strike>a</strike>Arrived in Manchester I had an<br/>
interview with brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and many<br/>
other brethren.</p>

of<br/>
^At^ The General Conference<br/>
held<br/>
At Manchester<br/>
Oct. 6th 1840</p>

<p>^There were^ Present: of the Twelve Brigham Young Heber C<br/>
Kimball Willard Richards Orson Pratt [[George Albert Smith|George A<br/>
Smith]] and Willford Woodruff: also 5 High Priests 19<br/>
Elders 28 Priests 14 Teachers and 2 Deacons.</p>

<p>The meeting was called to order at 10 o'clock<br/>
by Brigham Young when it was moved by him and<br/>
seconded by Wilford Woodruff that Orsen Pratt be President<br/>
of the Conference which was carried unanimously [[George Walker|George<br/>
Walker]] chosen clerk of the day.</p>

<p>After singing and prayer there <strike>was</strike> ^were^ represented 27<br/>
Conferences besides other Churches not yet organized into</p>",
42828.0,305,,"<p>I took the parting hand of Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] who <br/>
this day left [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. But my distress and pains of <br/>
body increased throughout the day insomuch that my <br/>
friends thought that I had caught the small-pox through <br/>
administering to the daughter of brother <strike>[[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]]</strike> ^[[James George Morgan|Morgan]]^</p>

<p>Sunday I grew worse but Dr [[William Copeland|Copeland]]<br/>
coming to visit me said it was not the small pox but <br/>
a severe attack of cold and fever. He prescribed for me <br/>
and I began to recover</p>

<p>Two days after I was better though still <br/>
weak in body and only able to trace a few lines in <br/>
my Journal with a feeble hand, and I was forced to fall <br/>
back upon Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Snow]] to write for me to Elder [[Brigham Young|Young]]</p>

<p>Last evening the noble spirited and <br/>
celebrated Temperance lecturer [[James Silk Buckingham|J. S. Buckingham]] finished <br/>
his course of lectures concerning his tour through the United <br/>
States which was delivered to a crowded audience Intreating <br/>
upon the country goverment laws customs fashions <br/>
religions sects and a variety of other matters he omitted <br/>
the Mormons or Latter-day Saints although he had <br/>
informed the public he should speak upon that <br/>
subject</p>

<p>This omission was in consequence of <br/>
his having the day previous to his lecture received <br/>
a letter from Dr Copeland including one of our Addresses<br/>
to the citizens of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] which clearly showed him <br/>
that we were American citizens Elders of the Church <br/>
and in the City and should have a knowledge of <br/>
what he presented to the community concerning us</p>

<p>Early this morning Dr Copeland received <br/>
a letter from J. S. Buckingham who acknowledge his <br/>
ignorance concerning our cause and very much wished information <br/>
by obtaining our writings. So I made him a present <br/>
of the Book of Mormon the Millennial Star and other <br/>
works hoping they <strike>may</strike> ^might^ do good</p>

<p>I walked out as far as brother Corner's <br/>
and found myself very weak. Many friends came <br/>
to see me in the evening.</p>",
42828.0,353,,"<p>has appointed.</p>

<p>""As concerning the resurrection I will merely say <br/>
that all will come from the grave as they lie down whether old <br/>
or young there will not be added to their stature one cubit <br/>
neither taken from it all being raised by the power of God <br/>
having Spirit in their bodies and not blood</p>

<p>Children will be enthroned in the presence <br/>
of God and the Lamb with bodies of the same statue as they <br/>
were on earth having been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br/>
They will there enjoy a fulness of that light glory and intelligence <br/>
which is received in the celestial Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>""Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord for <br/>
they rest from their labours and their works do follow them""</p>

<p>Before closing the speaker called upon the <br/>
vast assembly to humble themselves before God and in<br/>
mighty faith prayer and fasting call upon his holy name <br/>
that the inhabitants of that city might escape the power <br/>
of the Destroyer that ridest upon the face of the earth and <br/>
that the Holy Ghost may rest upon them and the earth <br/>
be sanctified under their feet.</p>

<p>After the close of the meeting the Prophet <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] informed the congregation that he should attend to <br/>
the ordinance of baptism in the river near his house <br/>
at 2 o'clock, and at the appointed hour the bank of the <br/>
Mississippi was lined with a multitude of people and <br/>
President Joseph Smith went forth into the river and <br/>
baptized with his own hands about 80 persons for the <br/>
remission of sins and what added joy to the occasion <br/>
was that the first person baptized was Mr. [[Lorenzo D. Wasson|L. D Wason]] <br/>
a nephew of sister [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma Smith]] and he was the <br/>
first of her kindred who had embraced the Gospel</p>

<p>At the close of this interesting scene the <br/>
administrator lifted up his hands toward heaven and <br/>
implored the blessing of God to rest upon the people <br/>
and verily the Spirit of God did rest upon the multitude <br/>
to the joy and consolation of our hearts.</p>

<p>After baptism the congregation again <br/>
reprised to the grove near the Temple to attend to </p>",
42828.0,260,,"<p>Conferences. The representation stood as follows:</p>

<p>Conferences and Churches 41<br/>
<strike>&amp;</strike> with members 3626; Elders 81 Priests 222</p>

<p>Teachers 74; Deacons 26.<br/>
This was an increase since the last Conference of the<br/>
British Mission of Members 1113; Elders 25 Priests 96</p>

<p>Teachers 15; Deacons 13.</p>

<p>After the transaction of much other business the<br/>
meeting was dismissed by prayer</p>

<p>President, Orson Pratt<br/>
Clerk [[George Walker|George Walker]].</p>

<p>Next day October 7th I sat in council with the<br/>
Twelve and many other officers at the Millennial<br/>
Star Office and in the evening we all attended a<br/>
discussion held at the Carpenter's Hall between a Mr<br/>
T [blank space] and Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]] on the one side<br/>
to prove the Book of Mormon not true and baptism<br/>
non essential to salvation. Elder Cordon sustained the<br/>
affirmative. The discussion was before 1500 people<br/>
In lighting the chandeliers before the meeting 12 of the<br/>
glasses bursted. During the day I filled two<br/>
mamouth sheets with an account of my travels from<br/>
Montrose to the present time to send by the hand of<br/>
Elder [[Samuel Mulliner|Mulliner]] to [[Ebenezer Robinson|E. Robinson]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith]]<br/>
editors of the ""Times and Seasons""</p>

<p>In Council with the Twelve next<br/>
day at the house of [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and on the following<br/>
Father [[Peter Melling|Peter Melling]] Patriarch of the Church of England<br/>
bestowed a patriarchal blessing upon my head and also two<br/>
days after became the mother of a<strike>s</strike> fine <strike>a</strike> son <strike>as I ever</strike><br/>
<strike>saw</strike>. He was named [[Heber John Richards|Heber John Richards]]</p>

<p>This was Sunday Oct 11th and we held<br/>
our asked meetings and in the evening Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]</p>",
42828.0,306,,"<p>I spent the 25 in paying my last visit <br/>
to the Saints in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and preparing for my <br/>
departure and in the evening I preached for the last <br/>
time in London before my return to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Next day I parted <strike>with</strike> ^from^ Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo<br/>
Snow]] and the London Saints and took train at the <br/>
Great Western Station for [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]]. I rode by rail <br/>
to [[Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, England|Wolton Basset]] eighty miles and then took coach 36<br/>
miles to [[Bath, Somerset, England|Bath]]. The road was very bad</p>

<p>Bath is the most striking place<br/>
to the eye of the Traveller that I ever saw. The city <br/>
extends to the summit of the high hills—Beechen <br/>
Clift and Bacon Hill and fills the valley between <br/>
The city is a very ancient <strike>antique</strike> looking place and <br/>
very picturesquely situated</p>

<p>I again took train at Bath to <br/>
Bristol and arriving called at No 12 Redcliff Crescent <br/>
Bedminster Parish where I found Elder [[Thomas Kington|Thomas <br/>
Kington]] and all his household and also Elder [[William Hill Pitt|Pitt]]<br/>
all of whom I was glad to meet.</p>

<p>The city of Bristol is a noted<br/>
place and one of [[England|England]]'s <strike>capital</strike> ^principal^ cities. Here I found <br/>
a small branch of the Church of Latter day Saints<br/>
raised up numbering thirteen souls.</p>

<p>On Sunday though still labouring <br/>
under a sever cold I preached for the first time in <br/>
the city of Bristol in the afternoon and evening. I <br/>
preached in the Theatre which was crowded to overflowing <br/>
with persons to hear me. There was good attention <br/>
paid and I felt that many souls would embrace the <br/>
work in Bristol</p>

<p>Next day was the first of <br/>
March and</p>

<p>My Birthday</p>

<p>This was the first day of Spring and I was 34 <br/>
years of age. My severe cold continued to afflict me <br/>
much. I spent the day with brother Kington and <br/>
the next ^(2<sup>nd</sup>)^ was somewhat better when I again preached</p>",
42828.0,354,,"<p>the ordinance of confirmation; and notwithstanding that<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] had spoken in the open air and stood in the water<br/>
and baptized so many about 56 of those baptized<br/>
received confirmation under his hands and during the<br/>
intermission of the meetings there was probably as<br/>
many more baptized and confirmed for their dead relatives<br/>
at the font by the Twelve. [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]] baptized about<br/>
40 and I assisted in confirming 20. It was truly an<br/>
interesting day.</p>

<p>On the Sunday following a large<br/>
assembly met in the grove near the Temple when<br/>
Elder [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]] addressed the assembly and<br/>
was followed by the Prophet Joseph who proved from<br/>
the Bible the doctrine of baptism for the dead.</p>

<p>At the close the congregation again<br/>
assembled upon the bank of the river and Joseph went<br/>
into the water and baptized all who came unto him<br/>
As I considered it my privilege to be re-baptized for<br/>
the remission of sins not having had the benefit of<br/>
the ordinance since administered to me by Elder [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah<br/>
Pulsipher]] when I entered the church I went forth into<br/>
the river and was baptized under the hands of Joseph<br/>
the Prophet. Likewise did [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and many<br/>
others and Joseph called upon me to assist him and<br/>
I did so baptizing twelve. Then the Prophet lifted<br/>
up his hands to heaven and blessed the people and<br/>
the Spirit of God rested upon the congregation. And<br/>
after the multitude had gathered again to the grove<br/>
Elder Taylor and myself were confirmed ^by the laying on of hands^ <strike>with the gift of</strike><br/>
<strike>the Holy Ghost</strike> and we then commenced <strike>to confer the<br/>
like blessing upon others</strike> confirming others.</p>

<p>On the next day Elder [[Lyman Wight|Lyman<br/>
Wight]] landed in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with about one hundred and<br/>
seventy Saints mostly from [[England|England]] and three thousand<br/>
dollars worth of property for the benefit of the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]<br/>
and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]]</p>",
42828.0,261,,"<p>preached to about 1500 persons. We commenced a letter historical and<br/>
religions to [[Ebenezer Robinson|E Robinson]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith]]</p>

<p><strike>Next day Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]] [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A Smith]] and myself purchased a broad cloth cloak just alike. I<br/>
spent some portion of the day in reading to proof sheet of the Book <br/>
of Mormon: so also I did the day following</strike></p>

<p>The work of God had progressed in the town of<br/>
[[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] the Elders had preached in the streets and the ministers<br/>
of the day especially the Methodists were full of malice and the<br/>
spirit of persecution was manifesting</p>

<p>I parted with Brother Richards, Young<br/>
and Kimball and took coach to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] on the 14th and<br/>
on the morning arose refreshed by sleep and better in body<br/>
than I had been on the previous day.</p>

<p>But my mind was troubled for the Spirit<br/>
manifested much discomfort and persecution among the Saints<br/>
throughout [[Europe|Europe]] and America and that many willfull<br/>
away: also that the ""Powers that be"" in America will rise up<br/>
against the Church and that it will be again driven and<br/>
that while trouble lay in the future before the people of<br/>
God greater calamities awaited the world</p>

<p>This same spirit rested at that time upon<br/>
the Elders and Saints generally in the British Mission and<br/>
there was mourning because thereof and multitudes of<br/>
the Saints were receiving testimonies of the clouds which were<br/>
gathering over the Church afterwards over the whole world<br/>
for judgment begins first at the House of God.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Lord was beginning<br/>
at this time to manifest what in a few years afterwards<br/>
completed the blacken written page of our history in the cruel<br/>
martardom of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] the Prophet and<br/>
Patriarch of the Church and the merciless extermination<br/>
of the Saints from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Concerning the testimonies of calamities<br/>
to fall upon the world direful wars to be poured out upon<br/>
all nations the bloody civil war and rebellion in America<br/>
which should resemble the former history of that continent<br/>
as related in the Book of Mormon when two great divisons</p>",
42828.0,307,,"<p>and for the last time in the Theatre in [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]]. There <br/>
were many present and as before good attention was paid</p>

<p>The follow day ^(3<sup>mch</sup>)^ I took a walk with <br/>
Brother [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] through the city <strike>of Bristol</strike>; after which we <br/>
visited the suspension bridge then being errected across the <br/>
river [[River Avon, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Avon]] at St Vincent's Rocks Clifton</p>

<p>This Suspension Bridge is 100 feet high <br/>
and 700 feet in length. There was a bar and two ropes <br/>
extending across from pillar to pillar and persons could <br/>
only pass over in a basket one or two at a time. This <br/>
basket goes on rollers or wheels and almost with the speed <br/>
of a steem engine. I saw several pass over in this way</p>

<p>At this place there were some of the greatest <br/>
curiosities in the petrified stones formed from the various <br/>
shells fish worms and other living creatures of the sea which <br/>
had been transformed into fossils of beautiful figures and <br/>
colours. I purchassed some small specimens and after<br/>
walking over and viewing the sea we returned and having a <br/>
look <strike>of</strike> ^at^ the Great Western—the first steem ship which <br/>
crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].</p>

<p>After we had returned home I went <br/>
to the water and baptized a lady by the name of <br/>
[[Elizabeth Howells|Howell]] and confirmed her at the room where we had <br/>
a good time. I laid my hands upon many and <br/>
blessed them. I blessed Elder Kington and all his <br/>
household.</p>

<p>Next day ^(4<sup>th</sup>)^ I parted from the Saints<br/>
in Bristol and took coach and rode to the ""passage""<br/>
over the river [[River Severn, England|Severn]] which I crossed in a passenger <br/>
boat and again took coach to the town of [[Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales|Cheapstow]]<br/>
Monmouthshire Wales. I arrived here at 11 o'clock &amp; <br/>
spent three hours in this noted town. I visited the <br/>
old famous Cheapstow Castle in which it is said that <br/>
[[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell]] was imprisoned for a season. This <br/>
castle is very antique and partly in ruins and there <br/>
are many of the same kind in [[Wales|Wales]] built for <br/>
defence against the English but it is evident from <br/>
their construction situation and location that they were </p>",
42828.0,355,,"<p>Minutes<br/>
of the<br/>
General Conference of the Church in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
April 6, 1842</p>

<p>The day was rainy and the Conference did not<br/>
meet until 1 o'clock p.m. President [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] occupied<br/>
the time mostly through the remainder of this day giving<br/>
instruction.</p>

<p>The following morning was also rainy<br/>
and the Conference did not re-assemble until 1 o'clock in<br/>
the afternoon.</p>

<p>A variety of subjects was presented to the<br/>
congregation by the First Presidency and the Twelve, and<br/>
those who desired to be ordained to the office of Elder<br/>
were called upon to come forward and give in their names<br/>
Many obeyed the call.</p>

<p>The sun arose pleasantly on the next<br/>
day and Conference continued at 10 o'clock in the morning<br/>
Elder [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] Presidents [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] &amp; [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]<br/>
and others spoke.</p>

<p>Then those who were to be ordained<br/>
Elders were requested to withdraw by themselves from<br/>
the congregation and they did so and six of the Twelve<br/>
namely [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
Lyman Wight [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and<br/>
myself went forward and ordained two hundred and <br/>
seventy five to the office of Elders.</p>

<p>This was truly an interesting time. More<br/>
Elders were ordained on this day than were ever before in<br/>
the Church of Latter-day Saints <strike>ordained</strike> in one day.</p>

<p>While this was going on Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] was from<br/>
the stand delivering a discourse to the multitude and there were<br/>
others baptizing and confirming at the same time at<br/>
the font and elsewhere.</p>",

each other such had been the prophesies and testimonies<br/>
of the Elders and Saints from the beginning</p>

<p>Soon indeed were the forebodings of the<br/>
Spirit concerning the dark and tempesteous clouds looming<br/>
in the future fulfilled in the rapid development of<br/>
events monumentous to the church and the whole world<br/>
First came the troubles of Saints at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] ending<br/>
with the dark and bloody page in our history of assassin<br/>
and extermination of the Saints from the civilized world<br/>
Quickly followed the rising of all [[Europe|Europe]] in revolution and<br/>
from that to the awful struggle between the North and<br/>
South such a rapid succession of great startling &amp; dire<br/>
events enough to fill in the history of the half a dozen <br/>
centuries.</p>

<p>I left the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]] on<br/>
the 16th with Bro [[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] and preached in [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]<br/>
that night which was the first time I ever preached<br/>
in that great town. At this time there were four<br/>
Saints in Birmingham and several others ready for <br/>
baptism. I felt that there would be a great work<br/>
done in that town.</p>

<p>Next day I took the rail at<br/>
Birmingham at 10 o'clock A.M. and arrived in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]<br/>
at 3 o'clock P.M. At the station I took the omnibus<br/>
to brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] where I found Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
We were glad to meet with each other once more.</p>

<p>We hired lodgings—board and sitting<br/>
room at No 40 Iron Monger Row [[St. Luke|St Luke's]]. Everything<br/>
was dear and we found that with the greatest economy<br/>
we could not do with much less than a pound per week<br/>
for each.</p>

<p>What few Saints were in London<br/>
at that time were very poor and not able to assist<br/>
us but we hoped the Lord would soon open the way<br/>
in that great Babylon of the nation that His work<br/>
might roll forth. It was however certainly the darkest<br/>
prospect before us of any place I had ever been in since</p>",

<p>From thence by coach 16 miles to [[Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales|Monmouth]] <br/>
the capital of [[Monmouthshire, Wales|Monmouthshire]] through an exceedingly <br/>
mountaineous country. Much of the route was by the <br/>
windings of the [[River Wye, Monmouthshire, Wales|River Y]] [blank space] The coachman ran his <br/>
hor<strike>e</strike>ses down the mountains which would have <br/>
endangered out lives had not the roads been good</p>

<p>When I arrived at Monmouth Elder <br/>
[[James George Morgan|James Morgan]] was waiting my coming and had given <br/>
out an appointment for me to preach in the town at 7 o'clock<br/>
at the house of [[Robert Houston Davis|Robert Davis]]. There was a crowded <br/>
meeting and many could not get into the house. Four offered <br/>
themselves for baptism. The Spirit witnessed to me <br/>
that there would many embrace the Gospel in Monmouthshire<br/>
and I said, ""The harvest is great and the labourers <br/>
few.</p>

<p><strike>I arose in the morning ^5<sup><u>th</u></sup>^ refreshed <br/>
by sleep and having taken breakfast with [[Mr. Maston|Mr Maston]]<br/>
I walked ten miles throug^h^ mud and water in a driving <br/>
March rain storm to sister [[Mary Morgan|Mary Morgan]] at [[Little Garway, Herefordshire, England|little<br/>
Garway]] where I found a pleasant family of the Saints.<br/>
We were drenched with rain but found a good fire &amp; <br/>
spent the day comfortably and in the evening I had an <br/>
interesting itnerview with Elder [[Martin Littlewood|Littlewood]]</strike></p>

<p><strike>The next day ^6<sup><u>th</u></sup>^ at Sister Morgan's <br/>
reading the History of [[Rome, Lazio, Italy|Rome]] with much interest and <br/>
and in the evening I met the officers of the <br/>
Church there in a council and had a good time</strike></p>

[[Little Garway, Herefordshire, England|Garway]] Conference<br/>
^held^ March 8th 1841</p>",

Smith]] occupied the Stand and <strike>wa</strike>were followed by [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] with<br/>
a few remarks and the Conference closed.</p>

<p>On the following day the Saints in<br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] assembled at the house of President [[William Marks|Marks]] to<br/>
pay their last respects to the remains of Ephraim his<br/>
son.</p>

<p>A large procession formed two by two<br/>
and walked to the Grove where a great concourse of the<br/>
citizens <strike>h</strike>a<strike>a</strike>s<strike>i</strike>sembled.</p>

<p>The Prophet Joseph spoke upon the<br/>
occassion with much feeling. Among his remarks<br/>
he said:</p>

<p>""It is a very Solemn <strike>and awful</strike> time.<br/>
I never felt more solemn. It calls to my mind the<br/>
death of my oldest brother who died in [[New York|New York]] and <br/>
of my youngest brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Carlos]] who died in Nauvoo<br/>
It has been hard for me to live on Earth and see<br/>
those young men upon whom we have leaned as<br/>
support, and comfort taken from us in the glory<br/>
of their youth. I have sometimes felt that I should<br/>
have been more reconciled to have been called myself if<br/>
God had so willed it. Yet I know we ought to be still<br/>
and know that it is of Him and be reconciled.</p>

<p>""All is right. It will be but a short<br/>
time before we shall all in like manner be called. It<br/>
may be the case with me as well as with you. Some<br/>
have supposed that brother Joseph could not die but this<br/>
is a mistake. It is true there have been times<br/>
when I have had the promise of my life to accomplish<br/>
such a such things; but having accomplished those<br/>
things I have not at present any lease of my life and<br/>
am as liable to die as other men""</p>

<p>The Prophet made many other remarks<br/>
of a similar kind and President [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] closed<br/>
The body was then conveyed to the grave in solumn<br/>
silence and each as they passed by droped a branch<br/>
of evergreen into the grave</p>",
42828.0,263,,"<p>I had entered the vineyard. But the Lord was with us and<br/>
we were not discouraged.</p>

<p>Sunday we met with the Saints at Bro<br/>
[[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]] three times read in the Book of Mormon gave instruction and<br/>
broke bread unto them. We had a good time though there was<br/>
only about half a dozen present. I felt the Spirit bear testimony<br/>
that there would be a work done in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]</p>

<p>I fell asleep having retired to rest in good<br/>
season and slept until <strike>12 o'clock</strike> (midnight) when I awoke and <br/>
meditated upon the things of God until 3 o'clock in the morning<br/>
and while forming a determination to warn the people in London<br/>
and overcome the power of darkness by the assistance of God<br/>
a person appeared unto me whom I consider was the Prince<br/>
of Darkness. He made war with me and attempted to<br/>
take my life. He caught me by the throat and nearly<br/>
choked me to death. He wounded me in my forehead<br/>
and I also wounded him in a number of places in the head<br/>
As he was about to overcome me I prayed to the Father<br/>
in the name of Jesus Christ for help. I then had power<br/>
over him and he left me though much wounded. Afterwards<br/>
<strike>a</strike> ^three^ persons dressed in white came to me and prayed with<br/>
me and I was immediately healed of all my wounds and<br/>
delivered of all my troubles</p>

<p>Next day [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and<br/>
myself spent several interesting hours in visiting the <br/>
[[British Museum, London, Middlesex, England|British Museum]]. In company with the rest of<br/>
my brethren of the Twelve who attended the General Conference<br/>
of July I had visited the [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] Museum and <br/>
to day I had a greater treat in spending a few hours<br/>
in one of the most worthy places in the world for a<br/>
traveller's note. The following is my synopsis of the history<br/>
and our inspection of the</p>

After the representation it was motioned that <br/>
[[John Needham|John Needham]] be ordained Elder [[William Morris, bap. pre 1840|William Morris]] Priest <br/>
and [[Thomas Rough|Thomas Rough]] Teacher

<p>These were ordained under the hands <br/>
of Elders Woodruff and Richards.</p>

<p>The meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock and <br/>
one was baptized.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Elder Levi Richards <br/>
spoke and I followed him. After meeting the Saints <br/>
contributed one pound to help me and I sold them 3 <br/>
Books of Mormon and fifty Addresses to the Citizens <br/>
of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. I then walked 5 miles with brother <br/>
Richards to brother [[John Holley|Holley's]] and spent the night. This <br/>
was the first time I had seen Brother Levi for <br/>
about two years</p>

<p>Next day in company of Elders Levi <br/>
Richards and [[Thomas Pitt|Thomas Pitt]] I walked to the city of [[Hereford, Herefordshire, England|Hereford]] <br/>
where Elders [[William Kay|Kay]] and others had been preaching. <strike>and</strike><br/>
<strike>the people were much stirred up</strike></p>

<p><strike>On Sunday a preacher arose before <br/>
two or three thousand in the Market House and <br/>
informed the multitude that he had a fresh letter <br/>
direct from America showing the origin of the </strike></p>",
42828.0,357,,"<p>On Sunday a large congregation met at the grove<br/>
[[William Law|William Law]] addressed the assembly for about an hour.</p>

<p>Then [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Seer arose in the power<br/>
of God and reproved and rebuked the wickedness before the<br/>
people in the name of the Lord. ""I wish to say a few<br/>
words to suit the condition of the general mass and I shall<br/>
speak with the authority of the Priesthood in the name of the<br/>
Lord God which shall prove a savior of life unto life or of<br/>
death unto death.</p>

<p>""Notwithstanding this congregation profess <br/>
to be Saints yet I stand in the midst of all characters and all<br/>
classes of men.</p>

<p>""If you wish to go where God is you must<br/>
be like Him or possess the principles which he possesses<br/>
for if we are not drawing towards God in principle we<br/>
are going from Him and drawing towards the Devil.</p>

<p>""Search your hearts and see if you <br/>
are like God. I have searched mine and feel to repent <br/>
of my ^all^ sins.</p>

<p>""We have thieves among us, adulterers<br/>
liars hypocrites. If God should speak from heaven<br/>
He would command you not to steal nor to commit<br/>
adultery nor to coveet not deceive but to be faithful over<br/>
a few things</p>

<p>""As far as we degenerate from God we<br/>
descend to the Devil and lose our knowledge and without<br/>
knowledge we cannot be saved.</p>

<p>""While our hearts are filled with evil<br/>
and we are studying evil there is no room in them for<br/>
good or for the studying of good</p>

<p>""Is not God good? Then be you good.<br/>
If He is faithful, then be you faithful. And to your<br/>
faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and seek for every<br/>
good thing. The Church must be cleansed and I proclaim<br/>
against all iniquity.</p>

of any of his time. These he directed should be<br/>
offered after his death to the British Parliament. He<br/>
died in 1753 and the offer was accepted and the act<br/>
of 26 [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] which directed the purchase of the collection<br/>
of Sir Hans Sloane also directed the purchase of<br/>
the Harleian Library of Manuscripts and enacted<br/>
that the Cottonian Library which had been given<br/>
to the Government in the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] should<br/>
with these form one general collection. In the<br/>
spring following the death of Sir Hans <br/>
Montague House was purchased as a repository for the whole<br/>
and it was determined that the new institution<br/>
should bear the name of</p>

<p>The [[British Museum, London, Middlesex, England|British Museum]]</p>

<p>Till the arrival of the Egyptian Antiquities from<br/>
Alexander in 1801 Montague House was sufficient<br/>
for the reception of its acquisitions. Most of the<br/>
Egyptian monuments were too massive for a private<br/>
dwelling and this first suggested the necessity of<br/>
an additional building which was rendered still more<br/>
indispensible by the purchase of the Townly Marbles<br/>
in 1805. A gallery adequite for the reception of<br/>
both was completed in 1807 and in 1823 upon the<br/>
donation of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George]] the IV of the Library of [[George III of Great Britain|George III]]<br/>
Government ordered the eviction of the present building<br/>
known as The British Museum of which the old<br/>
building Montague House forms the general front</p>

<p>From time to time the original<br/>
has been added unto until the British Museum when<br/>
we visited it covered five acres of ground</p>

<p>Though I felt interested in viewing<br/>
every apartment of this famous Museum which<br/>
contains the greatest collection in the world yet I felt<br/>
more deeply interested in that part called the Gallery<br/>
of antiquities especially the Egyptian department The<br/>
antiquities consisted mostly of the Greek Roman Jewish<br/>
Egyptian and some British</p>",

<p><strike>When he got through Elder [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]]<br/>
arose and informed the people that instead of its being a <br/>
new story it had been published for <strike>two</strike> ^seven^ years throughout <br/>
the United States and also <strike>throughout</strike> ^in^ [[England|England]]. This caussed <br/>
a great uproar for while some were driving the <br/>
man out of the place for lying others were crowding<br/>
around Elder Richards and [[William Kay|Kay]] to hear them preach<br/>
The crowd however was so exited that they left the <br/>
ground with hundreds following them.</strike></p>

<p>There never was a time when the <br/>
people were so much stirred up and eager to hear the <br/>
Latter-day Saints <strike>than</strike> ^as^ at the present and it was <br/>
expected that we should not get through the city without <br/>
having crowds around us. We did however and had <br/>
a view of [[Hereford, Herefordshire, England|Hereford]] Cathedral as we passed along and <br/>
reached Sister Buftons</p>

<p>There was at this time a small <br/>
Branch of the Church at Hereford numbering seven <br/>
members.</p>

<p>We parted <strike>wi</strike>from Brother [[William Hill Pitt|Pitt]] at Hereford <br/>
and continued to [[Lugwardine, Herefordshire, England|Lugwardine]] where I met with the <br/>
Church for the last time and preached from the <br/>
24 ch of Isaiah.</p>

<p>On the morrow I walked to <br/>
[[Shucknall Hill, Herefordshire, England|Shucknell Hill]] and had an interesting meeting with the <br/>
Saints and preached upon the gathering to Zion and <br/>
[[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. It as my last meeting with them <br/>
and I bid them farewell</p>

<p>Next day I walked to [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley <br/>
Hill]] and dined with Brother [[Edward Ockey|O<strike>a</strike>ckey]] whom I was <br/>
truly glad to see once more. We went together through <br/>
Standly Hill and called upon the Saints</p>

<p><strike>It was</strike> Six months had passed <br/>
since I had parted from the Churches in this region <br/>
but now I was again in the field where the Lord <br/>
by his blessing and the power of the Holy Ghost had <br/>
made my labours so abundantly fruitful. <strike>I had</strike></p>",
42828.0,358,,"<p>in the other world. Evil spirits have more knowledge and<br/>
consequently more power than many men on earth. Hence<br/>
it needs revelation to assist us and give us knowledge<br/>
of the things of God.</p>

<p>""What is reason that the Priests<br/>
of the day do not get revelation? They ask only to <br/>
consume it upon their lusts. Their hearts are corrupt and<br/>
they cloke their inequity by saying there is no more<br/>
revelations. Yet if any revelations are given of God<br/>
they are universally opposed by the Priests and<br/>
Christendom at large for it reveals their wickedness<br/>
and abominations.""</p>

<p>Many other remarks were also<br/>
made by [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]].</p>

<p><u>The</u> [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|<u>Nauvoo</u>]] <u>Legion</u></p>

<p>The Nauvoo Legion met on Parade on the<br/>
7th of May. The whole Legion was mustered and<br/>
it consisted of 23 companies. The Legion that day<br/>
on parade numbering not much less than 2 thousand<br/>
men and officers mostly all ^in^ well dressed uniform truly<br/>
made a splendid appearance. General Joseph Smith<br/>
had provided a sumptious dinner for the whole staff<br/>
with their ladies.</p>

<p>A steam boat landed at noon, <br/>
under the salute of the martial band, and landed<br/>
about forty Saints mostly from [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] England.</p>

<p>The second Sunday following<br/>
I attended meeting at the Grove and in the afternoon<br/>
preached. This was the first time I had spoken<br/>
to the Church at head quarters for two years.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting with brother<br/>
[[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C. Rich]] I went to the font and ^we^ baptized<br/>
^I was also baptized for^ about one hundred persons mostly for the dead.</p>

<p>At this time I was baptized <br/>
for my great grandfather [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Woodruff]] and<br/>
my great [[Sarah Woodford Woodruff|grandmother]] his wife. This was</p>",

being the only article of the kind known in the world. It was found<br/>
two miles and half from [[Rome, Lazio, Italy|Rome]] in the middle of the sixteenth century<br/>
and for more than two hundred years it formed the principal<br/>
ornament of the Barberini Palace. The material of which the<br/>
vase is made is glass. The figures which are executed in relief are<br/>
of a beautiful opake white and the ground of a dark transparent<br/>
blue. This superb specimen of Greek art was deposited in the<br/>
British Museum in 1810 by the Duke of Portland</p>

<p>Among the Egyptian Antiquities are a large<br/>
number of toombs coffins mummies hi<strike>y</strike>eroglyphics &amp; papyri enough<br/>
if translated into the English language to make a hundred vols.<br/>
as large as the Bible. In this part I felt more interested<br/>
then in any thing I saw as they were from three to four<br/>
thousand years old and would no doubt if translated have<br/>
revealed many most valuable and glorious things historical<br/>
and sacred concerning the early ages of the world and of [[Abraham (OT)|Abraham]]<br/>
[[Joseph (OT)|Joseph]] [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] and [[Israel|Israel]] in [[Egypt|Egypt]] and then what a world<br/>
of information they doubtless contained of their mysteries their<br/>
science and traditions of the origin of man the biographies<br/>
of [[Adam (OT)|Adam]] [[Noah (OT)|Noah]] and the first Patriarchs of our race and<br/>
of the institutions of religion recorded by the profound and <br/>
learned priesthood of Egypt.</p>

<p>having formed an intimate <br/>
acquaintance with one of the Overseers of the gallery of<br/>
Antiquities he explained many things to us concerning<br/>
what we saw which were very interesting</p>

<p>We saw the toomb said to be<br/>
that of [[Alexander the Great of Macedon|Alexander the Great]] and among many thousand<br/>
other things was [[Napoleon Bonaparte of France|Napoleon's]] snuff box which cost<br/>
three hundred guineas a piece of the Tower Babel<br/>
many lamps from [[Babylon|Babylon]] relics from the ruins<br/>
of Hrculaneum &amp; Pompei and a bronze statue of<br/>
[[Nero|Nero]] when he was young with antiquities and inscriptions<br/>
from [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] and an endless variety of articles from<br/>
all the ancient cities of [[Greece|Greece]] Rome Egypt and<br/>

much in shape from corresponding things of modern days</p>",

again in Zion, the home of the Saints.</strike></p>

<p><strike>From [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Stanley Hill]] we went to [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]] <br/>
and held a meeting with the Saints. Sister Fidler was present <br/>
she had been in Lord Summers family from a child but <br/>
was now rejected for receiving the fullness of the Gospel. Lord <br/>
Summers had since died and his son had commanded <br/>
her soon to leave his house. By letter from Elder [[Henry Glover|Glover]] <br/>
we heard that Elders [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[George Washington Joshua Adams|G. J. Adam]] had <br/>
just arrived in [[England|England]] from [[New York|New York]].</strike></p>

<p>Next day I <strike>wrote letters to Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] <br/>
and [[Lorenzo Snow|Snow]] and then</strike> went to [[Greenway, Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Greenway]] and preached, blessed <br/>
a child confirmed a member and administered the ordinance <br/>
of the Gospel to five sick persons; and on the morrow <br/>
I continued to [[Turkey Hall, Eldersfield, Worcestershire, England|Turkey Hall]].</p>

<p>Here on the Sunday I communed with <br/>
the Saints and preached to a large congregation upon <br/>

they were poor and had not the means</p>

<p>On the Sunday following which was the<br/>
29th of May I baptized in the font Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]<br/>
for the restoration of his health. At the same time I was<br/>
baptized by him in behalf of my grandfather [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad Woodruff]]<br/>
and grandmother [[Dinah Woodford Woodruff|Dinah Woodruff]]; and I also baptized my<br/>
wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] for her Grandfather [[Joshua Fabyan|Joshua Fabyan]] and grandmother<br/>
[[Sarah Brackett Fabyan, b. 1740|Sarah Fabyan]] and her great-uncle [[John Fabyan, b. 1704|John Fabyan]]. At the<br/>

hands of George A Smith for my [[Samuel Thompson, b. 1709|Great grandfather]] and<br/>
[[Hannah North Thompson|great grandmother Thompson]] and for my grandfather [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot<br/>

time I baptized my wife for her uncle John Fabyan and<br/>
aunt Sally Fabyan and her uncle George Fabyan and <br/>
uncle Joseph Fabyan. I also baptized Brother [[John Benbow|John <br/>
Benbow]] for six of his dead kindred and his [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]] for<br/>
six of her dead friends.</p>

<p>On the 14th of the following month<br/>
June, I sat in council with the Twelve and we decided that<br/>
Elder [[Hiram Clark, b. 1795|Hiram Clark]] should go to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] and take the<br/>
place of Elder [[Amos Fielding|Fielding]] who was to return with his family<br/>
to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Four days afterwards the citizens of <br/>
Nauvoo both male and female to the number of many<br/>
thousands assembled in Mass Meeting at the Grove<br/>
near the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]].</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Seer arose and spoke in<br/>
great plainness concerning the corruption and wickedness of<br/>
Gen. [[John Cook Bennett|John Cook Bennett]]. He also prophesied that if<br/>
the merchants of the city and the rich did not open their<br/>
hearts and contribute to the poor they would be cursed by<br/>
the hand of God and cut off from the land of the living</p>",

upon several persons has a view of the Palaces of St James<br/>
and strolled into Hyde Park visited the Lowther Bazaar the<br/>
only subterranen exhibition in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. We returned home<br/>
and held a prayer meeting at brother [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner's]]</p>

<p>Next day we hired Mr. [[J. Barrett|J. Barrett's]] [[Barrett|Academy]]<br/>
King's Square Goswell Street for three months to preach<br/>
in and I went to the printer and got 500 hand bills printed<br/>
to publish our place of worship and on my return Elder<br/>
[[George Albert Smith|Smith]] presented me with three letters to read and No 10 <br/>
of the Times and Seasons. The letter from Father [[John Smith, b. 1781|John<br/>
Smith]] to his son George A. informed me of the death of<br/>
my daughter.</p>

<p>In the evening of the same day<br/>
in company of Elder George A Smith I attended a <br/>
Missionary meeting of the Wesleyan Methodist connection<br/>
in their chapel City Road. It was considered one of the greatest<br/>
Missionary meetings ever held in the City of London and<br/>
the chair was filled by the [[Thomas Johnson|Lord Mayor]]. He was<br/>
a noble looking man and the insigna of office which<br/>
hung about his neck consisted of six gold chains which<br/>
were large and heavy</p>

<p>The object of the meeting was for<br/>
the Wesleyan Methodist to send out foreign missionaries<br/>
and to make collections enough to clear themselves of<br/>
a debt of £50,000. The best talents of [[Europe|Europe]] were<br/>
gathered together on this occassion Ministers of the<br/>
Church of England and of [[Scotland|Scotland]] were present besides<br/>
numerous ministers of the Methodist connection<br/>
There was much policy manifested in this combination<br/>
of the ministers of the different churches and their<br/>
influence for the purpose of raising means.</p>

<p>I heard speeches from 10 to 12 ministers<br/>
One from the Scotch church as he arose and addressed<br/>

<p><u>The</u> [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|<u>Nauvoo</u> <u>Masonic</u> <u>Lodge</u>]]</p>

<p>assembled at the Celebration of St. [[John (NT)|John]] on the 24th<br/>
^of June^ at 9 o'clock in the morning at the store of Joseph<br/>
Smith where the visiting brethren were received. The <br/>
procession was formed and marched to the stand in the<br/>
Grove near the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]. There were present about<br/>
six thousand persons. [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] delivered an <br/>
appropriate address and we then returned to the Lodge<br/>
where we dispersed for refreshment and re-met at<br/>
2 o'clock in Lodge capacity.</p>

<p>Sunday the 3rd of July about<br/>
six thousand persons assembled and was addressed<br/>
by Joseph the Seer from the 7th Ch. of [[Daniel (OT)|Daniel]] concerning<br/>
the Kingdom of God to be set up in the last days.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July the Nauvoo<br/>
Legion met and celebrated the day.</p>

<p>I preached in the afternoon of Sunday<br/>
the 1<strike>8</strike>7th and at the close of the meeting I went to the<br/>
font and confirmed about one hundred most of whom<br/>
were baptized for the dead.</p>

<p>The time had come when there <br/>
was again excitement throughout the land against<br/>
the Saints. This excitement had arisen partly because<br/>
the citizens of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] were disposed to exercise the</p>",
42828.0,267,,"<p>the hand and call him brother!""</p>

<p>A minister of the Church of [[England|England]] said</p>

<p>""My Lord and Wesleyan friends I wish you while looking<br/>
at the Church of England to cover her with the <br/>
cloak of charity"" . . . ""I would readily cover the imperfections<br/>
of the Wesleyan society but I know not where they are. I <br/>
would not hesitate to cover the imperfections of the Church<br/>
of [[Rome, Lazio, Italy|Rome]] were it in my power but they are all scarlet""</p>

<p>A Wesleyan minister then arose and said</p>

<p>""We are highly favoured on this occassion by having<br/>
""for our chairman the [[Thomas Johnson|Lord Mayor]] of London the chief<br/>
""Magistrate of the most renowned city in the world<br/>
""and his Lordship has like Caesar submitted himself to<br/>
""the worship and acknowledgement of Christ in this condescention<br/>
""But when rightly considered is not my Lord as highly honoured<br/>
in presiding over this vast body of respectable citizens this<br/>
evening who have met together on so important an occassion<br/>
as he would be to reign upon a throne for the angels in<br/>
heaven honour every effort that is made on earth for the<br/>
spread of the Gospel and the saving of the souls of men<br/>
My Lord and Christian friends How did the ancient<br/>
Apostles prevail? They were illiterate and had neither<br/>
money nor influence and their doctrinal were unpopular<br/>
yet they established the Gospel maintained the doctrine of<br/>
Christ and caused the nations to tremble; but this was<br/>
all by the power of God and not of men. My Lord<br/>
our circumstances are different from theirs. We have<br/>
influence and wealth we have splendid chapels and respectable<br/>
bodies and our numbers are many yet if God is not with<br/>
us we cannot prevail."" (I shouted Amen)</p>

<p>Thus speech after speech was made until<br/>
10 o'clock when a collection was made after which the<br/>
Lord Mayor arose and addressed about 3000 persons<br/>
in the city Road Chapel which was the first chapel ever<br/>
built by the immortal [[John Wesley|John Wesley]]. The Lord Mayor<br/>
said</p>

<p>""It is with pleasure that I have been permitted<br/>
to preside over this respectable body this evening on so</p>",
42828.0,313,,"<p>We had a very interesting time at the Conference <br/>
and a large assembly of the Saints. It was the last ^time^ that <br/>
I should attend in that part of my old and beloved field of labour <br/>
during my present mission to [[England|England]] and whether or not <br/>
I should ever meet here a conference assembly of Saints <br/>
again was one of the secrets of my future left to time to <br/>
reveal.</p>

<p>We had held our meeting without disturbance<br/>
from the mob who were present for they were kept quiet <br/>
by the Police in attendance, who were in disguise, <strike>but</strike><br/>
after the closing of the conference meeting a scene followed <br/>
not easily described in which the Saints and myself were<br/>
the actors.</p>

<p>I had escaped the mobbing of the <br/>
wicked but now if I may so describe it I was fairly <br/>
mobbed by the brethren and sisters</p>

<p>No sooner had the meeting closed than <br/>
multitudes of the Saints crowded around me and hands <br/>
were presented me on every side to bid me farewell<br/>
Many called for me to bless them before I departed, they <br/>
cried out ""Lay hands upon me and heal me before you <br/>
go"" One came with, ""Brother Woodruff I am turned out of <br/>
doors for my religion. What shall I do?"" Another with <br/>
""I am ready to go to Zion but my wife wont go with <br/>
me. Shall I leave her to gather with the Saints?""<br/>
A wife in turn says ""My husband beats me and turns <br/>
me out of doors because I have been baptized. I have <br/>
money enough to carry me and the children to Zion <br/>
will you let me go without him?"" ""Brother Woodruff<br/>
my mother is over 80 years of age and has willed me <br/>
60 pounds at her death but will not emigrate with me <br/>
Must I stay for her to die or leave her now to go <br/>
with the Saints?"" One said, ""I have sold my little <br/>
place and shall have 30 pounds to-morrow but must go <br/>
out into the street. I have not enough to carry my family <br/>
to America. Can you help me to a few pounds or tell <br/>
me what to do? And an Elder cried out ""How much <br/>
longer must I preach in England before you will let me</p>",
42828.0,361,,"<p>rights which the Constitution of the United States guaranteed<br/>
to them in common with all other citizens—namely in<br/>
attending the elections and voting for whom they pleased<br/>
It was also partly in consequence of [[John Cook Bennett|John C. Bennet]] who had<br/>
been cut off the Church for his wick^ed^ness and corrupt deeds<br/>
and had gone forth into the regions around stiring up strife<br/>
against the Church by lying against [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and others.</p>

<p>At this date the office of the Times and<br/>
Seasons needed a new stock of Paper and other materials<br/>
for printing and binding which could not be purchased nearer<br/>
than [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis]] and Joseph appointed me to go to that<br/>
city to purchase the new supply.</p>

<p>So on the 23rd of July I went up to<br/>
the Steamboat landing to watch for a boat and tarried<br/>
near by for four days at brother [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wights]] when<br/>
myself and Messrs [[Thomas Ashton|Ashton]] and [[Freedom Moulton|Moulton]] took passage on<br/>
board the Galena.</p>

<p>We found the boat heavily loaded with led<br/>
and the water being low we soon saw that we should <br/>
have a slow journey.</p>

<p>The boat crossed to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] and<br/>
unloaded into lighters and the hands had a tremendious<br/>
fight while doing so.</p>

<p>Next day we sailed to [[Nashville, Dubuque County, Iowa Territory|Nashville]] and<br/>
over the rapids to [[Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Keokurk]] and ran upon the rocks<br/>
many times.</p>

<p>Next morning we left Keokurk in rainy<br/>
weather and after we had passed Tully the boat ran upon<br/>
a sand bank and lay till next morning when we got<br/>
off and after passing [[Marion City, Marion County, Missouri|Marion City]] the boat ran upon<br/>
another Sand bank which hindered her course for<br/>
six hours.</p>

<p>I took a severe cold which settled into<br/>
the Bilious Fever and was exceedingly ill the remainder of the<br/>
journey.</p>

<p>We arrived in St Louis on the 2nd of<br/>
A^u^gust. I had suffered severely and my face was frightfully<br/>
spotted by Musketoes</p>",
42828.0,268,,"<p>important an occassion the memory of which will be indelibly<br/>
fixed upon my mind as one of the most pleasing events<br/>
of my life and I trust I shall ever be as ready to perform<br/>
every duty required of me by the citizens of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]<br/>
as I have been to meet with our Wesleyan friends this<br/>
evening."" The house rang with applauds.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all this who<br/>
can imagine my feelings? None only those in like<br/>
circumstances to myself. Here was I with a mission<br/>
and a message from the Lord to the inhabitants of<br/>
London and stood in their midst ready to deliver<br/>
it as soon as He should open the way yet I<br/>
was as little known to them as was [[Jonah (OT)|Jonah]] to<br/>
the citizens of [[Nineveh|Ninevah]] while in the whale's belly<br/>
Notwithstanding this great display of talant power<br/>
and policy to send missionaries to the heathen<br/>
they as much needed an humble messenger of<br/>
God to teach them the Gospel of Jesus Christ in<br/>
its primative character as Ninevah did a Prophet<br/>
to cry repentance unto its inhabitants. I retired home<br/>
alone reflecting upon these things.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we circulated<br/>
and posted our hand bills which contained the following</p>

<p>copy of the First placard of the Church in London</p>

<p>""He that judgeth a matter before he heareth isnot wise""</p>

worship at Mr. [[J. Barrett|J. Barretts]] [[Barrett|Academy]] 57 King's<br/>

on Tuesday and Thursday Evenings each week at Eight<br/>

<p>will be delivered by Elders Woodruff and Smith<br/>
(late from America)<br/>

a long while to get a chance to speak to you"". ""Good <br/>

bless you!""</p>

<p>Thus was I for more than an hour <br/>
after the close of the meeting assailled with the affectionate <br/>
outbursts and adieus and the host of perplexities of these <br/>
Saints who crowded around me as children to their <br/>
father. <strike>for as such in Christ they were.</strike></p>

<p>Many of the Saints parted from me <br/>
in tears and many followed me to [[Turkey Hall, Eldersfield, Worcestershire, England|Turkey Hall]] where I <br/>
spent the night and saw they filled the house until a late <br/>
hour beging counsel and instruction of me. One <br/>
of these was a Baptist Minister who had just been <br/>
baptized into the church.</p>

<p>On the morrow in company of <br/>
Elder [[John Needham|Needham]] I walked to [[Keysend Street, Berrow, Worcestershire, England|Keysend Street]] where <br/>
I preached to a crowded congregation of Saints and <br/>
on the following day I walked to [[Wind Point, Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Wind Point]]</p>

<p>On the way I went into the <br/>
Giants cave on [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]]. It was dug out of <br/>
solid rock and its dimensions are six feet by four <br/>
at the mouth 12 feet in length and seven feet in <br/>
length. The stone that covered the mouth had <br/>
rolled down the Hill.</p>

<p><strike>After viewing the Giants Cave I</strike><br/>
^where I^ visited the Saints <strike>at Wind's Point</strike> and thence <br/>
continued to [[Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Colwall]], <strike>and</strike> ^where I^ met a large congregation <br/>
of the Saints and preach to them upon the <br/>
Gathering, which everywhere now formed the burden of <br/>
my soul to the Churches I were bidding farewell. <br/>
Two of those present Elders James and [[Henry Jones|Henry Jones]] were <br/>
like Paul had been great persecutors but were now <br/>
preaching what they had once persecuted</p>

<p>I received a letter from Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]]</p>",
42828.0,362,,"<p>We arrived at 12 o clock <strike>a</strike>A.<strike>m</strike>M. and stoped at<br/>
the American House.</p>

<p>I had only 24 hours to do my<br/>
business in and after dinner notwithstanding the <br/>
fever was raging upon me I commenced and bought<br/>
my stock of paper and walked till ten o'clock at<br/>
night and went to bed very weary sick and in severe<br/>
pain and did not sleep until 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>I was awoken with the bleeding of<br/>
the nose. I lost a pint of blood and felt very weak<br/>
yet I commenced business before breakfast and got<br/>
my goods on board by 2 o'clock in the afternoon.<br/>
I took dinner and went to bed tired and sick indeed.</p>

<p>The boat started at 1 o'clock in<br/>
the evening and we arrived at [[Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Keokurk]] having had<br/>
over two days and nights of suffering. I had bled<br/>
at the nose considerable and had the canker. <strike>which<br/>
I killed with tobaco</strike>.</p>

<p>I left the boat and took stage<br/>
and arrived at [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] at the time of a Masonic<br/>
procession and the institution of a Lodge in that<br/>
place.</p>

<p>I had an interview there with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
and then crossed to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and arrived home thoroughly<br/>
pickled with the bil<strike>l</strike>ious fever.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding my state I<br/>
could not stop to rest for I found that the printing<br/>
office had stood still ten days for want of paper.</p>

<p>The boat was five days getting<br/>
over the Rapids during which time I went down<br/>
the river six miles with a skiff and got from<br/>
the steam boat what paper we needed for present use<br/>
We were until midnight rowing over the Rapids and<br/>
in addition to my fever I caught a severe cold.</p>

<p>As soon as the boat had landed<br/>
our freight at Nauvoo and I had seen it distributed<br/>
to its several departments I went home and took to<br/>
my bed and passed through the severest fit of sickness</p>",

<p>The following Sunday we preached for the first<br/>
time in [[Barrett|Barretts Academy]] at 3 o'clock. There were present about<br/>
fifty persons unto whom I preached and Elder [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] preached<br/>
in the evening; but it was the hardest matter to awaken<br/>
an interest in the subjects that I had ever found.</p>

<p>Next day I received a package of seven letters<br/>

<p>Extract of the Letter from my Wife<br/>
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|<u>Phebe</u>]].</p>

<p>July 18th 1840</p>

<p>My Dear Willford,</p>

<p>What will be your feelings when I <br/>
say that yesterday I was called to witness the departure<br/>
of our little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] from this world. Yes she<br/>
is gone! The relentless hand of Death has snatched her<br/>
from my embrace. But ha! she was too lovely too<br/>
kind too affectionate to live in this wicked world</p>

<p>When looking upon her I have often thought<br/>
how I should feel to part with her. I thought I could not<br/>
live without her especially in the absence of my companion<br/>
But she has gone! The Lord hath taken her home to<br/>
himself for some wise purpose. It is a trial to me<br/>
but the Lord hath stood by me in a wonderful manner<br/>
I can see and feel; and that he has taken her home and<br/>
will take better care of her than I possibly could for a<br/>
little while until I shall go and meet her.</p>",
42828.0,315,,"<p>who informed me that the work of God was rolling on in <br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and that he had baptized seven the Sunday previous <br/>
I also received a letter from Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]].</p>

<p>Next day <strike>I had an interview</strike> with Elder <br/>
[[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] <strike>and then with him</strike> ^I^ walked over [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern<br/>
Hill]] and called upon Elder [[Samuel Jones, b. 1823|Samuel Jones]]; Thence through <br/>
Great Malvern to [[Crowcutt, Worcestershire, England|Crowcat]] and held a meeting at brother <br/>
[[George Brooks|George Brooks]]' and had an interesting time with a large <br/>
number of Saints whom I had baptized about a year before</p>

<p>To [[Dunns Close, Herefordshire, England|Dunsclose]] the day after visiting <br/>
many of the Saints by the way laying hands upon the <br/>
sick and blessing and counselling others of the flock. They <br/>
all were happy to see me for I had baptized most of <br/>
them when I first opened that field of labour. ^Next day^</p>

<p>I preached at Dunsclose at the house <br/>
of [[Edward Jenkins|Edward Jinkins]] to a crowded meeting but a wicked <br/>
rabble disturbed us much and I was constrained sharply <br/>
to reprove them in the power of God</p>

<p>A very rainy day was the 20th <br/>
but accompanied with a guide I journeyed to [[Rough Leasowe, Worcestershire, England|Rough Leaser]]<br/>
and thence to [[Ridgeway Cross, Herefordshire, England|Ridgeway ^Cross^]]. Here I found Elder [[Thomas Henry Clark|Thomas Clark]]<br/>
at his stone quary. I took several speciments of curious <br/>
petrified stone formed by the water. We <strike>then</strike> walked <br/>
to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frooms' Hill]] and visited the Saints by the way</p>

<p>Sunday followed and this was the <br/>
last Sabbath I should meet the Saints in [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standly]] <br/>
and Froom's Hill.</p>

<p>At <strike>brother [[John Cole|John Coles]]</strike> Frooms Hill,<br/>
I met the Saints <strike>in the</strike> ^Sunday^ morning and had a crowded <br/>
house and in the afternoon at Standly Hill where <br/>
I communed with the Church. <strike>and</strike> <strike>a</strike>At the close of the <br/>
meeting I had a busy time shaking hands with the <br/>
Saints and parting from them many of whom wished <br/>
me to bless them and others to heal them</p>

<p>I spent the night with brother Levi <br/>
Richards at Elder [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey]] and on the morrow <br/>
we held <u>conference</u>.</p>",
42828.0,363,,"<p>I ever had in my life.</p>

<p>I had a thorough course of bilious fever<br/>
and was brought exceedingly low and for a time struggled<br/>
between life and death. Some of the time I felt like<br/>
gathering up my feet and sleeping with my fathers</p>

<p>I was confined to my house and mostly<br/>
to my bed from the 10th of August to the 1<strike>2</strike>9th of September<br/>
making forty days.</p>

<p>The Twelve came and anointed me<br/>
and laid hands upon me and I felt the testimony<br/>
that I should recover but after I began to revive I had<br/>
a relapse twice</p>

<p>In one instance I was requested to attend<br/>
a council of the Twelve in the case of [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]. I<br/>
was very weak but yet I thought I would try to meet with<br/>
them and supposed that we should meet at Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor's]]<br/>
who was also very low with the bilious fever; but on our<br/>
arrival we found him so very feeble that he was not<br/>
able to have the council at his house. So we removed<br/>
to President [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smiths]] Office.</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] conveyed me<br/>
in his carriage to the place of meeting but I had not<br/>
been in the house more than ten minutes before my<br/>
strength began to fail me. I laid down upon a bench<br/>
but no sooner was I laid down than I became unconscious<br/>
and my breath stoped.</p>

<p>My brethren raised me up and took me<br/>
to the door and with the aid of air and water I was brought<br/>
to breath again but not without a hard struggle between<br/>
life and death.</p>

<p>The brethren laid hands upon me<br/>
and Hyrum Smith prayed for my recovery and I soon<br/>
began to breathe freer but my strength was entirely gone.</p>

<p>They conveyed me home and it being<br/>
in a warm season I was much troubled for breathing<br/>
through the night. Several days elapsed before I<br/>
revived again.</p>

<p>During my sickness there had been</p>",
42828.0,270,,"<p>Yes Willford we have one little angel in heaven and I think<br/>
it likely her spirit has visited you before this time</p>

<p>It is hard living without her and she<br/>
used to call her ""poor pa, pa; and putty Papa many<br/>
times in a day. She left a kiss for her Papa with<br/>
me just before she died.</p>

<p>She eat her dinner just as well<br/>
as usual on Thursday was taken ill about 4 o'clock<br/>
with prestness for breath. The Elders laid hands upon<br/>
her and anointed her a number of times; but the<br/>
next day her spirit took its flight from this to another<br/>
world without a groan</p>

<p>To-day little Willford and I with quite <br/>
a number of friends accompanying us came over to<br/>
Commerce to pay our last respects to our little darling<br/>
in seeing he decently burried. She had no relatives<br/>
to follow her to the grave or to shed a tear for<br/>
her but her Ma and little Willford******</p>

<p>I have just been to take a pleasing<br/>
melancholy walk to Sarah's grave. She lies alone in<br/>
peace. I can say ""The Lord gave and the Lord<br/>
hath taken away and blessed be the name of the<br/>
Lord. ****** [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]].</p>

<p>On the 20th I finished a long<br/>
communication to the Editors of the Times and Seasons<br/>
signed [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] W. Woodruff and [[George Albert Smith|George A.<br/>
Smith]]. It was commenced on the 12th. I copied it off<br/>
and it filled 4 sheets. We wrote several others to [[Alfred Cordon|A<br/>
Cordon]] &amp;c and next day heard from [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>
and received also a letter from [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] with the<br/>
present of one pound. On the 30th I wrote a long<br/>
letter to my wife and we were often receiving and writing<br/>
communications to our brethren of the Twelve and<br/>
the Elders Saints relatives and friends both in [[England|England]]<br/>
and America It may well be imagined that<br/>
the numerous letters which we received and wrote from<br/>
time were not only interesting but often important to<br/>
us and the Church and that they were as much a branch</p>",

42828.0,364,,"<p>some important events in the Church. The Lord had<br/>
manifested through the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] that it was his<br/>
will that the First Presidency the Twelve the High Council<br/>
the quorum of High Priests and the Elders quorum<br/>
should as a general thing go into the vineyard</p>

<p>The instructions were for the Elders<br/>
to confine themselves to the free States and mostly<br/>
to [[New England, United States|New England]] and the [[Canada, British North America|Canadas]] and not to go<br/>
into any of the Indian or Slave States</p>

<p>There had been a special Conference <br/>
called in consequence and about four hundred Elders<br/>
had gone into the Vineyard and many others were<br/>
going. Since the foundation of the Church there had<br/>
never been such a turn out into the ministry before<br/>
as now</p>

<p>Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] and myself were<br/>
the only ones of the Twelve left and we were sick<br/>
and could not go into the vineyard: moreover it<br/>
was thought wisdom for us to continue in the<br/>
printing buisness.</p>

<p>The Prophet had of late been much<br/>
persecuted by being hunted by Sherifs and officers<br/>
from [[Missouri|Missouri]] and [[Illinois|Illinois]] by the orders of Governors<br/>
[[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Carlin|Carlin]] under pretense of taking him<br/>
to Missouri to try him upon their false charge of<br/>
his being accessary to the shooting of Ex-Governor<br/>
[[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]. This was nothing but pretence and a trap<br/>
to take the Prophet upon a charge which caught the<br/>
spirit of persecution in our enemies and not because there<br/>
was any evidence in the case.</p>

<p>But though the Prophet Joseph had<br/>
been of late like [[John (NT)|John]] on the Isle of Patmos he<br/>
had presented the Church with some glorious principles and<br/>
had occassionally appeared in the midst of the Saints<br/>
but I was deprived of the privilege of being present as<br/>
I was confined with sickness</p>

<p>September the 19th I commenced<br/>
work for the first time for forty days and cut one</p>",
42828.0,271,,"<p>of our ministerial labours as preaching or baptizing. but I <br/>
cannot alwa<strike>s</strike>ys note the detail of our communications nor would<br/>
the bare mention give the value of the correspondence of the<br/>
Twelve one to the other and to the Elders labouring under their<br/>
direction and their communications to the representative men of<br/>
the Church in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. Much more than can appear to<br/>
the reader who will be told in my synopsis of the year that<br/>
in 1840 I wrote 200 letters and received 112 and much more<br/>
than would appear if told the amount of correspondence of the<br/>
rest of the Twelve and Elders in the ministry labouring with<br/>
us much of our letter writing to each other in counselling <br/>
directing assisting and building each other up belong to the<br/>
history of the rise and progress of the British Mission.<br/>
Therefore in my journal I always noted my correspondence<br/>
as a branch of my ministerial history</p>

<p>The dark season of the year November opened<br/>
upon us and the prospect of our mission in the city of<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] was in keeping therewith. There is so much going <br/>
on in this great modern [[Babylon|Babylon]] to draw the attention of<br/>
the people that it seemed almost to require the trumpets<br/>
blast from heaven to awaken the attention of the inhabitants<br/>
to our proclamation of the restoration of the fulness of<br/>
the Gospel</p>

<p>We were here like the Apostles of<br/>
old without purse or scrip to warn the city of London.<br/>
where we had to pay high for everything we required, and<br/>
to pay <strike>ourselves</strike> for a place to preach in. We were at<br/>
this time about out of money, but still we felt to trust<br/>
in God</p>

<p><strike>November the 14 was</strike> Sunday ^Nov 1st^ <strike>and</strike> I<br/>
preached in the afternoon in the Academy to about<br/>
thirty and in the evening to about 50. We broke bread<br/>
unto the Saints and this evening there seemed to be some<br/>
interest manifested in inquiring into the work.</p>

<p>I received a letter from my mother-in-law<br/>
containing the news of the death of my uncle [[Joseph Hart, b. 1787|Joseph Hart]]<br/>
and wrote to my father in reply</p>",

his farewell address. <strike>to the Conference and Saints <br/>
in general.</strike></p>

and after singing</strike> The Conference closed with the <br/>

the next two days I spent in drawing wood to my door.</p>

<p>I was forced to these exertions as it were<br/>
on the first moment of my recovery for I had been sick so long<br/>
that we had consumed our food and fuel</p>

<p>Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] returned home<br/>
for a few days to some printing and they were going out<br/>
again to hold conferences throughout the State. I had an<br/>
interview with them and learned that they had met in Council<br/>
with brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] who thought it widom for Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]]<br/>
and myself to continue at home and attend to the printing.</p>

<p>There was at this time a prospect of<br/>
the town of [[Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Keokurk]] coming into the hands of the<br/>
Saints and Joseph's counsel was for me to go there<br/>
in that case and publish a political paper and Elder<br/>
Taylor to publish the Times and Seasons in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]].<br/>
So I managed the affairs of my family to be ready to <br/>
do as the Lord should direct however in the sequel I did<br/>
not go to Keokurk. In addition to my own sickness<br/>
Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] had a species of fellen on both her<br/>
thumbs which had caused her much pain for two or<br/>
three weeks and my little daughter had been quite ill<br/>
about the same length of time and dangerously ill <br/>
for several days.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly the next Sunday Joseph<br/>
appeared in our midst and spoke to the Saints much<br/>
to their edification and comfort</p>

<p>Three Sundays later I preached<br/>
to the congregation and warned the Saints <strike>against taking</strike> ^not to take^<br/>
a course against the interest of the Church but to <br/>
take one which would help Joseph in his exile.</p>

<p>Some time after this we had a fire<br/>
in the upper part of the printing office. A minutes<br/>
delay and we should not have saved the building</p>

<p>On the 30th of October for the first<br/>
time the Saints held meeting in the Temple of the<br/>
Lord in Nauvoo. A temporary floor was laid<br/>
within the unfinished walls and seats prepared for</p>",

again visited the Museum. I having formed an acompanitance<br/>
with the keeper of the Egyptan antiquities and it being<br/>
a private day he accompanied us through the various<br/>
appartments and spent several hours in explaining<br/>
the most important items of history of the collection<br/>
of Egyptian Jewish Greek and Roman antiquities</p>

<p>I had a specimen of [[Guy Fawkes|Guy <br/>
Fawke's]] day in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] on the 5th but the crowd<br/>
of boys with their historical effigy was not so interesting<br/>
to me as the letters which the postman brought. One<br/>
was from [[Samuel Jones, b. 1823|Samuel Jones]] containing good news and a<br/>
pound to assist me. The others were from my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]<br/>
and Elder [[William Oglesby Clark|Wm Clark]] who informed me that Phebe and<br/>
my little son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] was at his [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father's]] house. He<br/>
said they shall not want anything which I can bestow<br/>
and may God hold it as an everlasting covenant<br/>
between thee and me. He further informed me that<br/>
the temporal affairs of the church at Headquarters was<br/>
never in a more prosperous state and that a number<br/>
of families had arrived from [[England|England]] and my wife<br/>
had an interview with Bro [[William Benbow|Benbow]]. There was no<br/>
moving against the Saints but they were gathering rapidly<br/>
to the body of the Church in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Next Sunday we preached and broke<br/>
bread with the Saints but only very few attended our<br/>
meetings and on the 9th received letters Elders<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]] [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]], [[Theadore Curtis|Curtis]] [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] and [[S. Johnson|Johnson]]<br/>
Elders Kimball and Pratt both informed us of the<br/>
death of Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] who was the first<br/>
Patriarch of the Church of Latter-Day Saints and the<br/>
father of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]].</p>

<p>Elder Kington spoke of the letter which<br/>
he or the Saints sent me containing £2 which was<br/>
lost. I went to the general Post Office and ^it^ and the<br/>
Post Master said he would trace it out. I mention these<br/>
letters with gifts of money sometimes for they explain<br/>
from whence came the means which first supported the</p>",
42828.0,318,,"<p>After the meeting was dismissed I was about <br/>
three hours shaking hands with the Saints healing the <br/>
sick and giving counsel to the multitude who surrounded <br/>
me many of whom were in tears as we parted. Nearly <br/>
fifty came to me to ask me to take them to Zion <br/>
when I had not means to take myself. I however gave <br/>
Sister [[Mary Jenkins Foxall|Foxal]] five pounds to make up enough to help <br/>
her and her [[James Foxall|husband]] and children to the land of <br/>
America. She had raised 30 pounds by using <br/>
every exertion for six months to gather with the <br/>
Saints and the five pounds which I gave her was a <br/>
donation of Elder [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey]] who was imparting <br/>
of his substance to help the poor of the Church <br/>
to gather.</p>

<p>After biding the multitude of Saints <br/>
farewell I went to Elder O<strike>a</strike>ckey's to spend the night <br/>
accompanied by Elders [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] and [[William Kay|Kay]]</p>

<p>We had been in the house but a <br/>
short time when ^3 of^ Edward Ockey's brothers came<br/>
in for the purpose of having a contest because <br/>
their brother and sister had embraced the gospel <br/>
and was about to gather with the Saints. They <br/>
manifested much wrath against me and after <br/>
conversing with them about 3 hours they left the <br/>
house and we were once more in peace</p>

<p>After conversing together until <br/>
the third watch of the night we retired to rest <br/>
closing one of the busiest days of my life.</p>

<p>I arose in the morning refreshed <br/>
by sleep and after <strike>conversing</strike> several hours with Elders <br/>
Richards Kington Kay Ockey and others of the Saints<br/>
I was under the necessity of parting with the Saints <br/>
in this region.</p>

<p>In biding them farewell I found <br/>
in our hearts and memory of our association many <br/>
ties which bound me to those I were leaving behind<br/>
and among the faithful ones were the Ockeys.<br/>
Brother Edward Ockey and his sister [[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann]] were of</p>",
42828.0,366,,"<p>three thousand persons. The room was crowded and<br/>
the walls lined with people. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] had returned<br/>
to the city and was expected to preach but ill-health<br/>
and other causes prevented him.</p>

<p>On the same day [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]<br/>
returned from the east with his family and the<br/>
next day came to my house and was taken with<br/>
the Cholera Morbeus and was low for several days.</p>

<p>My son [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] was taken down<br/>
with the croup and for a time was dangerous.</p>

<p>The Twelve returned home on<br/>
the 4th of November.</p>

<p>Joseph wished Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John <br/>
Taylor]] and myself to take the responsibility of<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Printing Office, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Printing Office]] and liberate him from it<br/>
He offered to rent the property to us for simple interest<br/>
and we concluded to take it.</p>

<p>The City Council spent several<br/>
days in session passing a law relative to Writ of<br/>
Habus Corpus and after it was passed Joseph<br/>
felt secure to stay at home as it protected him<br/>
as well as other citizens.</p>

<p>On the 7th of the following month<br/>
(December) Elder Orson Hyde returned to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
having in his mission been in [[England|England]] [[Germany|Germany]]<br/>
[[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and other parts of [[Asia|Asia]].</p>

<p>In England Elder Hyde was with<br/>
the Twelve when they in the capacity of a quorum<br/>
fully organized the British Mission; in Germany he<br/>
preached and published the Gospel in the German<br/>
language and circulated the tracts among the various<br/>
nations and in Jerusalem he visited Mount Olivet<br/>
He was the first Elder of the Latter-day Church<br/>
<strike>w</strike>that ever visited Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The following Sunday Elder<br/>
Orson Hyde at President Joseph Smiths delivered<br/>
an interesting <strike>an</strike> account of his travels at Jerusalem<br/>
and home again. He spoke of the Mount Olivit</p>",
42828.0,273,,"<p>work in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. I wrote to Elders [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] and [[Daniel Browett|Browett]]<br/>
of my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] field and a very lengthy one to my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife's]]<br/>
[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father]] and [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|mother]] giving an account of this country.</p>

<p>This was the [[Thomas Johnson|Lord Mayor's]] day when<br/>
the chief Magestrate of the chief city of the world takes the oath<br/>
of office. It is a great day in London. I saw the<br/>
gorgeous procession pass.</p>

<p><strike>This day</strike> Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]] informed<br/>
me that it was the counsel of the Twelve <strike>for him</strike> ^[[George Albert Smith|G A Smith]]^ to go<br/>
immediately to the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] and spend some time with<br/>
the churches there as there was only about work enough<br/>
for one in London and so early next morning we <br/>
started for [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] and I was left again alone</p>

<p>The next few days I felt lonely<br/>
without my companion brother Smith for although London<br/>
is not a wilderness a Latter-day Saints Travelling Elder<br/>
at that date would be almost as solitary there.</p>

<p>At night on the 12th while I was<br/>
preaching Brother [[William Hill Pitt|Wm Pitt]] from [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] entered the<br/>
room I was surprised to see him for I was not<br/>
looking for any ^one^. He became a companion in the<br/>
ministry for me during the next five days</p>

<p>On the 16th I received a letter from<br/>
Elder [[Thomas Henry Clark|Thomas Clark]] containing a gift of £1 and<br/>
one from Elder [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] informing me of the progress<br/>
of the work in Herefordshire and surrounding<br/>
country. I wrote to them and Elder Kington<br/>
and held several hours conversation with a<br/>
follower of [[Joanna Southcott|Joanna Southcott]] and several days<br/>
after had a long interview with five of her<br/>
followers. In the meantime Elder Pitt had<br/>
left me and took a mission to [[Ipswich, Suffolk, England|Ipswich]]. and<br/>
I had preached several times and as usual receiving<br/>
and writing letters daily.</p>

<p>On the 19th I preached at the<br/>
Academy. Brother [[William Hulme|Hulme]] a captain of one of<br/>
the Pickford's Boats on the London canal was<br/>
present with two of his hands whom he had baptized.</p>",
42828.0,319,,"<p>a good and wealthy family. <strike>and</strike> They had many trials to <br/>
pass through to do the will of God <strike>and maintain their <br/>
faith and integrity</strike>  and to gather with the Saints for their <br/>
brothers were exceedingly set against them. But brother <br/>
[[Edward Ockey|Edward]] had maintained his integrity like a man of God <br/>
and was making every preparation to gather with the Saints <br/>
but his sister [[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann]] had fears that her brothers would <br/>
hinder her gathering.</p>

<p>Having bid farewell to the Saints of <br/>
[[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standly Hill]] I walked to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frooms Hill]] and conversed with <br/>
the Elders untl 2 o'clock when I took the parting hands <br/>
of Elders [[Levi Richards|Richards]] [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] [[William Kay|Kay]] and others and with my <br/>
carpet-bag with about 20 lbs weight in it walked 15 miles <br/>
to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] in four hours</p>

<p>When I arrived there I was so very <br/>
lame and weary with my heavy load and fast walking that <br/>
I could scarcely walk at all. I then took the rail and <br/>
arrived in [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] at 10 o'clock at night but was <br/>
exceedingly lame and weary. I spent the night with <br/>
Elder [[James Riley|James Riley]] 24 Park Street.</p>

<p>I had now fairly ended my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]<br/>
mission and bidden a last farewell to that field of labour <br/>
where the Lord had blessed me beyond all my expectations</p>

<p>I now left three conferences in the region <br/>
which I opened one year before on the 5th of the same month <br/>
that I left this vineyard planted all over with Churches<br/>
numbering fifteen hundred Saints. <strike>I have given <br/>
the minutes of those Conference not to load my book <br/>
with dry statestics which is never interesting to the <br/>
reader but to lay at once before the view if I may <br/>
so express it diagrams of the rise and progress of the <br/>
work number of Churches planted and conferences organized <br/>
in that region.</strike> <strike>If the readers will thus consider these</strike><br/>
^The^ minutes which I have recorded <strike>they</strike> will <strike>see in them</strike> <br/>
^show^ at a glance a volume of history of the rise and progress<br/>
of the Churches in Herefordshire and the regions around.<br/>

of the General Conferences that the reader may have</p>",

him of the days of Christ</p>

<p>The year had rolled around and ended<br/>
with me in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] attending principally to the duties of<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Printing Office, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Printing Office]] and I was tankful to the Lord for his<br/>
mercies which had brought me through the events and<br/>
scenes of 1842 and prolonged my life which Death had<br/>
threatened for future labour in His cause.</p>

my life hung as upon a thread</p>",
42828.0,274,,"<p>On the following day I dined with him on board of<br/>
his boat with three Saints</p>

<p>The [[Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, b. 1786|Princess]] Royal of England was<br/>
born on the 21st and all [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] rang with jubilant<br/>
bells.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday the<br/>
forepart of which was spent in reading and conversing<br/>
with Father [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corner]] and his family and in the<br/>
^In the^ afternoon and ^22nd^ evening ^of Sunday 22^ we held public meeting<br/>
when four offered themselves for baptism but it<br/>
had been with hard labouring and much expence<br/>
that we had obtained this little success in the<br/>
establishment of the work in London.</p>

<p>I commenced this day a long<br/>
epistle to my wife in which I sent her about<br/>
thirty extracts from letters for her to present<br/>
to the Editors of the Times and Seasons for them<br/>
to publish as they thought fit.</p>

<p>The Sunday following I<br/>
again preached twice and baptized and confirmed<br/>
three. These were</p>

<p>The First Baptized by me in London<br/>
Next day I took a very interesting walk with Dr<br/>
[[William Copeland|Wm. Copeland]] through every part of the college of<br/>
surigeons at Lincoln's Inn Fields and on my return <br/>
home I was soon joined by Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] who had come to spend a week <br/>
or two in London. This was the first time<br/>

The day after my arrival in [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]<br/>
I visited the Brass Foundry and then travelled to [[West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England|West<br/>
Bromwich]] and on the morrow took coach to [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] and <br/>
had an interview with Elder [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]] and wrote <br/>
to Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]]

<p>We met a large congregation of the <br/>
Saints in the Hanley meeting Room when Elder George <br/>
A. Smith and myself preached. I was happy to learn <br/>
that the work of the Lord was rapidly prospering in <br/>
the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]]</p>

<p>I received and read the 11 No of the <br/>
Millennial Star. It contained an interesting letter <br/>
from President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] to the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve.</p>

<p>In [[Longton, Staffordshire, England|Longton]] I baptized seven persons <br/>
one was [[Alexander Barton|Alexander Barton]] a Potter Artist and modler<br/>
and then parted with the Saints &amp; walked to [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] and <br/>

with Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and brother [[Abram Newbury|Newbury]] and his<br/>
two sisters we started in a two horse sleigh and<br/>
crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Missisippi River]] on the ice and travelled<br/>
15 miles into [[Iowa Territory|Iowa Territory]] and joined Mr. Abraham<br/>

<p>We had just passed through a critical time in<br/>
the history of our people. Joseph had been presecuted<br/>
hunted and driven into the wilderness in consequence<br/>
of illegal proceedings false oaths edicts of governors and<br/>
pursuit from Sheriffs.</p>

<p>But the^re^ being now a new Governor<br/>
Joseph had come forward and given himself up<br/>
to the authorities of the State and demanded trial.<br/>

<p>Visit to the [[Tower of London, London, Middlesex, England|Tower of London]]</p>

<p>In company of Brothers [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber<br/>
C Kimball]] on the 3rd of December I visited the Tower<br/>
of London without seeing which the traveller would lose a <br/>
capital page from the history of his travels in England.</p>

<p>As usual I called at the time and entered in my<br/>
Journal a synopsis of  its history &amp;c</p>

<p>The Tower is situated on the east side<br/>
of the city about 800 yards from London Bridge and near<br/>
the bank of the [[River Thames, England|Thames]]. At first it consisted of<br/>
no more than what at present is called the White Tower<br/>
It has been said though without sufficient authority that<br/>
[[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar]] built it but there is the strongest of evidence<br/>
that [[William the Conqueror of England|William the Conquerer]] was its first designer and<br/>
builder. It has three batteries — The Devils Battery<br/>
the Stone Battery and the Wooden Battery all mounted<br/>
with cannon.</p>

<p>The Tower was a palace during five<br/>
hundred years but ceased to be so in the time of<br/>
[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and here some of the darkest tragedies of<br/>
of [[England|England's]] monarchs were enacted and immortalized<br/>
by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespear's]] Pen. The principal buildings are<br/>
the Church the White Tower Govenor's House The Bloody<br/>
Tower the offices of Ordinance of the Keepers of the<br/>
Record the Jewel Office the Horde Armoury Queen<br/>
Elizabeth's armoury the grand Store House in which<br/>
is the small armoury the train of Artillery and<br/>
the Tent Room the new Store House houses for<br/>
the chief and inferior officers mess house for the<br/>
officers and barracks for the soldiers. In addition<br/>
to these there is a street called the Mint which<br/>
includes one third part of the Tower</p>

<p>The Grand Storehouse is north of the<br/>
White Tower. It extends in length 345 feet</p>",

<p>Thence to [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]] with several of the <br/>
brethren and sat in Council with a number of the officers <br/>
Among other business was the case of a brother [[William Momford|Mumford]] who <br/>
was practising the black art fortune telling &amp;c but as he <br/>
persisted in his course the Council withdrew fellowship from <br/>
him. One thing is worthy of notice that while the <br/>
Priesthood was upon him he could not set his magic glasses<br/>
as before but did after the office of Priest was taken from <br/>
him</p>

<p>I spent the night at Brother [[William Box|^William^ Box]] who had been <br/>
sorely tempted and afflicted of the Devil for many days <br/>
We laid our hands upon him and cast the devil out and <br/>
he had peace.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 20th of March the</p>

<p>[[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]] Conference</p>

<p>of the Church of Latter-day Saints met and there <br/>
were present of the Twelve [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and Willford<br/>
Woodruff with one High Priest 13 Elders 28 Priests 10 Teachers <br/>
and eight Deacons. The Conference was held in the <br/>
Majestrates Assembly Room.</p>

<p>At the close of the Conference it was voted <br/>
that ""This Conference grants unto Elders Woodruff and <br/>
George A. Smith a letter of recommendation manifesting <br/>
that the Church in this region accept of their labours <br/>
and consider that they have filled their mission with <br/>
honour and dignity""</p>

<p>We had a very interesting time<br/>
on this occasssion. The conference was held in a place <br/>
which would hold 800 and it was crowded; but there<br/>
was perfect order and much good feeling manifested<br/>
during the day. There was <strike>a good</strike> prospect of a continued <br/>
increase in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]]</p>

<p>George A. Smith was the President <br/>
of the Conference and [[Thomas Joseph Filcher|T. J. Fitcher]] and [[Osmond Shaw|O Shaw]] clerks</p>

<p>Next day George A Smith and myself <br/>
met the officers in Council at the Hanley ^Meeting^ Room and gave</p>",
42828.0,369,,"<p>Too well our history had told us how [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his brethren<br/>
had been incarcerated in prison where they had laid in <strike>some<br/>
cases the year round</strike> inhumanly treated and their lives in<br/>
constant jeopardy and all in contempt of law and without<br/>
trial. This was the reason why Joseph wished not to<br/>
be delivered up to the tender mercy of [[Missouri|Missouri]].</p>

<p>But the election of a new Governor had<br/>
given the Prophet a chance of a trial and he returned and<br/>
demanded one and delivered himself to the authorities of<br/>
the State of [[Illinois|Illionois]].</p>

<p>The demanded trial was granted<br/>
him before the Supreme Court of the United States and<br/>
he had been honourably acquitted according to the law<br/>
of the <strike>law of </strike> ^land^ as he well knew he would be if granted<br/>
a legal trial and not committed to the lawless power<br/>
of those in authority who sought his liberty and his<br/>
life.</p>

<p>Joseph had now returned to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
to have a Jubilee with the Church</p>

<p>The seventeenth of January was<br/>
appointed by General Proclamation for humiliation<br/>
fasting prayer and thanksgiving for the release<br/>
and delivery which we had received.</p>

<p>Meetings were appointed throughout<br/>
the city. I met at President Joseph Smiths where<br/>
we had a very interesting time.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph spoke for some<br/>
length on the Kingdom of God and the baptism of<br/>
[[John (NT)|John]] and other subjects of interest the substance of<br/>
which was aftwards delivered by the Prophet in the<br/>
Temple and which I shall presently give.</p>

<p>At our meeting on this General<br/>
Thanksgiving day besides the address of the Prophet<br/>
many prayers and exhortations were made. I spoke twice<br/>
and felt much of the Spirit <strike>of</strike> <strike>the</strike> present.</p>

<p>The next day Joseph and his<br/>
[[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|lady]] made a feast for his friends to keep the<br/>
day as a time of rejoicing for his deliverance</p>",

England accompanied by their favorite lords classed<br/>
with them mounted on their horses and in the armour<br/>

suits of mail which they wore in life</p>

<p>The horses stand mounted by their riders<br/>

beautiful form. A. D. 1450</p>

<p>Then comes [[Edward IV of England|Edward the IV.]] in a complete<br/>
suit of tournament armour (AD 1465) and following is<br/>
[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in a fluted suit of elegant form supposed<br/>
to be of German manufacture and afterwards we<br/>
have [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] a king who for ability and bloody<br/>

[[England|England's]] Kings</p>

<p>[[Henry VIII of England|Harry VIII]] is in a suit of gilt plate<br/>
armour and with him is [[Charles Brandon|Charles Brandon]] Duke of<br/>
Suffolk of the same date as his master A D 1520<br/>
and he is also in plate armour and next is [[Edward Clinton|Edward <br/>

satisfaction in consequence of [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt's]] return to<br/>

<p>We met at [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]]<br/>
and the First Presidency and the Twelve conversed<br/>
over the subject. Orson had humbled himself<br/>
for opposing Joseph and the brethren of his own<br/>
quorum and desired very much to return to his<br/>
former place.</p>

<p>After our counselling together we<br/>
assembled at the [[Mississippi River, United States|River]] and Joseph went down into<br/>
the water and baptized Orson and his [[Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt|wife]] and<br/>
Widow [[Lydia Dibble Granger|Granger]]. The Prophet then confirmed<br/>
them and ordained Orson to the Apostleship and<br/>
his former standing amongst us. This caused<br/>
our hearts to rejoice.</p>

had been appointed in his stead as a member of<br/>

When ever there has been a righteous man unto whom the<br/>
Lord has revealed his word and given power and authority<br/>
to administer in his name then has the Kingdom of<br/>
God been set up and where there is a Priest of the Most<br/>
High—a minister who has power and authority from<br/>
Him to administer in the ordinances of the Gospel<br/>
and officiate in the Priesthood there is the Kingdom<br/>
of God.</p>

<p>In consequence of rejecting the Gospel<br/>
of Jesus Christ and the Prophets whom God hath<br/>
sent His judgements hath rested upon people cities<br/>
and nations in various ages of the world. This was<br/>
the case with the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah which<br/>
were destroyed for rejecting the Prophets</p>

<p>Now I will give my testimony. I<br/>
care not for man. I speak boldly and faithfully<br/>
and with authority.</p>

<p>How is it with the Kingdom<br/>
of God? Where did the Kingdom of God begin?<br/>
What constitutes the Kingdom of God?</p>

<p>I answer where there is no Kingdom<br/>
of God there is no salvation. Where there is a Prophet <br/>
or a Priest or a righteous man unto whom the Lord gives<br/>
his oracles there is the kingdom of where the oracles<br/>
are not there the Kingdom of God is not.</p>

to the Kingdoms of the earth. We will keep the laws of<br/>
the land. We do not speak against them nor ever have<br/>
but we can scarcely make mention of the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
and our persecutions but the cry goes forth that we<br/>
are guilty of treason &amp;c.</p>

<p>We speak of the Kingdom of God<br/>
on the earth and not the kingdoms of men.</p>

<p>The plea of many is that we have<br/>
no right to receive revelations; but if we do not receive<br/>
revelation we do not have the oracles of God and they<br/>
who have not the oracles of God are not His people</p>",

specimen of pistols carbines &amp;c of the times of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] &amp;<br/>
[[James I of England|James I]] &amp; [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[William III of England|William III]] to which considerable<br/>

with Gilt furniture and th<strike>e</strike>ree swords and a helmet<br/>
and girdle ^which^ belonged to [[Tipu Sultan|Tippo Saib]]</p>

<p>We next entered the long room where<br/>
we saw various figures wearing the armour of the various<br/>
periods in which they lived Kings soldiers &amp;c. One<br/>
was for a man seven feet high. At the extremity of<br/>
the room is a crusader upon his barbed horse said<br/>
to be 700 years old. Here we also saw great variety<br/>
of curious things. Passing into</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth's Armoury</p>

<p>we found weapons of war of every variety and most of<br/>
them in use before fire arms were invented. This<br/>
room according to tradition was the prison of the<br/>
celebrated Sir [[Walter Raleigh|Walter Raleigh]]. At the end of the room<br/>
is a sprightly figure of Queen Elizabeth upon a<br/>

is in imitation of that worn by her in her procession<br/>

<p>President Young having called the house to <br/>

prayer. Elder [[Thomas Ward|Thomas Ward]] was chosen clerk</p>

<p>The President then made some introductory <br/>
remarks relative to the organization of the Church in the <br/>
House of the Lord in America concerning the different <br/>
Quorums in their orders.</p>

<p>The representation of the Churches and <br/>

<p><u>The Baptism of [[John (NT)|John]]</u></p>

<p>As touching the Gospel and Baptism <strike>of</strike> ^which^ John<br/>
preached I would say John came preaching the<br/>
Gospel for the remission of sins. He had his<br/>
authority from God and <strike>the</strike> ^His^ oracles <strike>of God</strike> were<br/>
with him and the Kingdom for a season seemed<br/>
to rest with John alone.</p>

<p>The Lord promised [[Zechariah (OT)|Zechariah]]<br/>
that he should have a son and Zechariah was<br/>
a descendant of Aaron. [##Luke 1:13##] And the Lord had<br/>
promised that the Priesthood should continue with<br/>
[[Aaron (OT)|Aaron]] and his seed throughout their generations.</p>

<p>""'Let no man take this honour<br/>
upon himself except he be called of God as was<br/>
Aaron' and Aaron received his call by revelation""</p>

<p>An angel of God also appeared unto<br/>
Zachariah while in the Temple and said that <br/>
he should have a son whose name should be<br/>
John and be should be gifted with the Holy Ghost""</p>

<p>Zachariah was a Priest of the Lord<br/>
and officiated in the Temple and John was a Priest<br/>
after the order of his father and held the Keys of<br/>
the Aaronic Priesthood and was called <strike>of God</strike> to<br/>
preach the Gospel <strike>of His</strike> ^and the^ Kingdom ^of God^. The<br/>

42828.0,373,,"<p>""But, it may be said, the Kingdom of God<br/>
could not be set up in the days of [[John (NT)|John]] for he said<br/>
the Kingdom was at hand. But I would ask could<br/>
it be any nearer than in the hands of John? The<br/>
people needed not wait for the day of Pentecost<br/>
to find the Kingdom <strike>of God</strike> for John had it with<br/>
him and he came forth from the wilderness crying<br/>
'Repent ye for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand<br/>
as much as to cry out' Here I have the Kingdom<br/>
of God and you can obtain it. I am coming<br/>
after you and if you do not receive it you will<br/>
be damned. And the scriptures represent<br/>
that all [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] went out unto John and were<br/>
baptized of him.</p>

<p>""Here was a legal administrator.<br/>
Those who were baptized were subjects for the<br/>
King and the laws and oracles of God were there<br/>
Therefore the Kingdom of god was there""</p>

<p>No man could have better<br/>
authority to administer than John and even<br/>
our Saviour submitted to that authority himself<br/>
by being baptized of John. Therefore the<br/>
Kingdom of God was set up upon the earth even<br/>
in the days of John.</p>

<p>There is a difference between<br/>
the Kingdom of God and the fruit and blessings<br/>
which flow from that Kingdom. Because there<br/>
were more miracles gifts visions healings tongues &amp; c<br/>
in the days of Jesus Christ and his Apostles<br/>
&amp; on the day of Pentecost than under John's <br/>
administration it does not prove by any means<br/>
that he had not the Kingdom of God. It does not<br/>
prove this any more than it would that a woman<br/>
had not a milk pan because she had not a pan of<br/>
milk; for while the pan might be compared to<br/>
the Kingdom of milk might be likened to the <br/>
blessings of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>On leaving the [[Tower of London, London, Middlesex, England|Tower]] we walked to the<br/>
[[River Thames, England|Tames]] and waited for Elder [[Brigham Young|Young]] who visited the [[Thames Tunnel, London, Middlesex, England|Tunnel]]<br/>
and purchased a moddle of it then returned to our home<br/>
and held a meeting in the evening</p>

<p>Leaving Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] at home<br/>
writing to his wife I accompanied President Young on<br/>
his visit to [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]] and [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]]<br/>
and on the next day I went out with him to find the<br/>
Book of Mormon which we heard was published and<br/>
for sale by some person unknown. The report was<br/>
untrue</p>

<p>Sunday was an interesting day <br/>
to us Elder Young Kimball and Priest [[Robert Williams|Williams]]<br/>
attended meeting at St Pauls in the morning and<br/>
I met with the Saints at Father [[Henry Christophilus Connor|Corners]] and read<br/>
and conversed with them and in the afternoon met<br/>
at the [[Barrett|Academy]] and had about 50 present Brother Kimball<br/>
preached to them.</p>

<p>An Independent Minister invited<br/>
me home to take ten with him. I accepted his<br/>
invitation had an interesting time and preached the<br/>
Gospel to him and he received my testimony and offered<br/>
me his chapel which would hold 800. He said he<br/>
thought he should be baptized and would try and<br/>
get his society to do the same.</p>

<p>We met again in the evening<br/>
and had more at our meeting than ever before. Brother<br/>
Brigham Young preached and was followed by brothers<br/>
Kimball Williams Corner [[William Hulme|Hulme]] and myself.</p>

<p>We had a very interesting time<br/>
and one offered himself for baptism. There were some<br/>
of the Aikenites present one of whom purchased a<br/>
Hymn Book. They wished us to call upon them<br/>
and thought they would be baptized. We then met<br/>
at Father Corner's and communed with the Saints and<br/>
had a good time.</p>",
42828.0,326,,"<p>The Conference reassembled pursuant to adjournment <br/>
and opened by prayer.</p>

<p>The scattered members were represented <br/>
consisting of nearly 50 members not included in the foregoing</p>

<p>The [[Brigham Young|President]] then made some remarks <br/>
on the office of Patriarch and concluded by moving that <br/>
Elder [[John Albiston Sr.|John Albertson]] be ordained to that office. This <br/>
was seconded by Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and carried unanimously</p>

<p>Resolved that <br/>
[[George Darling Watt|G. D. Watt]] [[George Washington Joshua Adams|G. J. Adams]] [[Amos Fielding|Amos Fielding]] [[William Kay|William<br/>
Kay]] [[John Sanders|John Sanders]] [[James Riley|J. Riley]] [[Thomas Richardson|Thomas Richardson]]<br/>
[[James Whitehead|James Whitehead]] [[Thomas Dunville|Thomas Dunville]] [[James Galley|James Galley]] <br/>
&amp; [[George Simpson|George Simpson]] be ordained High Priests.</p>

<p>Resolved that the following persons be <br/>
ordained Elders:</p>

<p>[[William Miller|William Miller]] [[William Leach|William Leach]], [[John Sands|John <br/>
Sandy]] [[William Moon|William Moon]] [[William Hardman|William Hardman]], [[William Young Black|Wm <br/>

Benson]] [[Theophilus Brotherton|Theophilus Brotherton]] [[John McIlwrick|John Mc Ilwrick]]<br/>
and [[William Green|William Green]].</p>

<p>The Council of the Twelve then <br/>
proceeded to organize all the Churches into Conferences <br/>
throughout the Kingdom of [[Great Britain|Great Britain]], and <br/>
appoint presiding Elders over them.</p>

<p>The Conference then adjourned till 7 o'clock<br/>
when it re-assembled and opened by singing and prayer</p>

<p>The Patriarch [[Peter Melling|Peter Mellen]] was then <br/>
called upon to pronounce<strike>e</strike> the Patriarchal blessing <strike>and</strike> ^who^ <br/>
the head of John Albertson previous to his being <br/>
ordained to the office of Patriarch. He then laid <br/>
his hands upon him and blessed him</p>

<p>The Twelve afterwards laid their <br/>
hands upon him and ordained him to the office <br/>
of Patriarch.</p>

<p>The High Priests and Elders were <br/>
then ordained and much counsel was given by the <br/>
President and others of the Twelve</p>

forth preaching repentance and baptism for the remission<br/>
of sins but at the same time crying 'There cometh<br/>
one after me mightier than I the Latchet of whose<br/>
shoes I am not worthy to unloose.</p>

<p>And Christ came according to the<br/>
word of [[John (NT)|John]]. He was greater than John because<br/>
he held the keys of the Melchisidic Priesthood<br/>
and Kingdom of God and had before revealed<br/>
the Priesthood to [[Moses (OT)|Moses]]; and Jesus in his<br/>
teachings says upon this rock I will build my church<br/>
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<br/>
What Rock? Revelation!</p>

<p>Yet Christ was baptized by John<br/>
to fulfill all righteousness. ""Again He says except<br/>
ye are born of water and the Spirit ye cannot<br/>
enter the Kingdom of Heaven""; and though the<br/>
heavens and the earth pass away my word shall<br/>
not pass away""</p>

<p>If a man be born of the water<br/>
and the Spirit he can enter into the Kingdom of<br/>
God.</p>

<p>It is evident that the Kingdom of<br/>
God was upon the earth and John prepared subjects<br/>
for that kingdom by preaching the Gospel to them<br/>
and baptizing them. He prepared the way<br/>
before the Saviour or came as a forerunner and<br/>
prepared for the preaching of Christ.</p>

<p>Christ preached through [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]<br/>
on the same ground where John had preached and<br/>
when the Apostles were raised up they ^all^ worked in<br/>
Jerusalem and Jesus commanded them to tarry there<br/>
until they were endowed with power from on high.</p>

<p>Had they not work to do in<br/>
Jerusalem? They did work and prepared people<br/>
for the Pentecost; but the Kingdom of God was<br/>
with them before the day of Pentecost as well as<br/>
afterwards.</p>",
42828.0,281,,"<p>I rejoiced at the prospect which was opening before<br/>
us for we had laboured a long time and the work had<br/>
gone slow but now a wide opening was being made to<br/>
roll on the work of the Lord in the Metroplis of [[England|England]]</p>

<p>But, though slow the work in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]<br/>
in its early history, and with us in calling the people into<br/>
the Kingdom of God like as with the servants of the<br/>
King in the parable, whose invitation to the Marriage<br/>
Feast was met every man with his excuse yet the Lord<br/>
had been with us, and the prophetic spirit was abundant<br/>
with testimonies of our mission. Doubtless this prophetic<br/>
view of the future made our missionary labours in<br/>
the great Babylon of modern times less wearisome<br/>
than it otherwise would have been. The Spirit all<br/>
along bore testimony to us that there would be a great<br/>
work done in London and Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] prophesied<br/>
that there would the greatest numbers and the largest<br/>
conference. This has since been abundantly fulfilled<br/>
for London has become the metropolis of the foreign<br/>
missions of the Church.</p>

<p>On the seventh of the month we<br/>
all acomplanied Dr. [[Samuel Copeland|Copeland]] to the college of Surgeons<br/>
and next visited the National Gallery and other<br/>
parts of the city and then returned and took tea after<br/>
which Elder Kimball baptized one at the Bath<br/>
in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Taberancle Square]]. Brothers Young [[Robert Williams|Williams]]<br/>
and myself walked into another part of the town<br/>
and had a view of ""Life in London"".</p>

<p>A Visit to the Stables of the Queen</p>

<p>It was a rainy day in London but we<br/>
had all concluded to visit [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St. James' Park]] [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham<br/>
Palace]] and the Queens stables. Brothers Young<br/>
and Williams went on before us to see the <br/>

amounting to about seven hundred. A large fragment <br/>
was left for some who were not present</p>

<p>While the cake was passing [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>

<p>Elder [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] appealed powerfully to the meeting <br/>
and covenanted with the Saints present in a bond <br/>
of mutual prayer during his mission to [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] <br/>
and the East which was sustained on the part of <br/>
the congregation by a hearty Amen.</p>

<p>Elder [[Joseph Fielding|Joseph Fielding]] made some remarks<br/>
and spoke of the rich cake and considered it a type <br/>
of the good things of that land land from whence it came <br/>
and from whence they had received the fulness of the <br/>

Latter-Day Church that this was not only the </p>",
42828.0,375,,"<p>It was also with [[John (NT)|John]] and he preached<br/>
the same Gospel and baptism that Jesus and the Apostles<br/>
preached after him.</p>

prepare the disciples for their mission into the world</p>

<p>""Whenever a man can find out the<br/>
will of God and find an administrator legally authorized<br/>
from Him there is the Kingdom of God; but where<br/>
these are not the Kingdom of God is not. All<br/>
the ordinances systems and administrations on the<br/>
earth are of no use to the children of men unless<br/>
they are ordained and authorized of God for nothing<br/>
will <strike>same</strike> ^save^ a man but a legal administrator<br/>
for none other will be acknowledged either by<br/>
God or angels.</p>

<p>I know what I say. I understand<br/>
my mission and business. God Almighty is<br/>
my shield and what can man do if God is my<br/>
friend? <u>I shall not be sacrificed until my</u><br/>

<p>All flesh is as grass and the governor<br/>
is no better than other men. When he dies he<br/>
is but a bag of dung.</p>

<p>I thank God for preserving<br/>
me from my enemies. I have no enmity. I<br/>
have no desire but to do all men good. I feel<br/>
to pray for all men. We do not ask people<br/>
to throw away any good which they have we<br/>
only ask them to come and get more. What<br/>
if all the world should embrace this Gospel?<br/>
They would then see eye to eye and the<br/>
blessings of God would be poured out upon the<br/>

Saints started walked to [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St. James Park]] and through the<br/>
whole length of it and visited the [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Palace]] and the Queen's<br/>
Stables.</p>

<p>The first stable we entered was that<br/>
of the State Horses. They were 12 in number and<br/>
the most beautiful cream coloured Hanovarians. They<br/>
were the most kind and intelligent of anything of the<br/>
brute creation I ever saw and were about seventeen<br/>
hands high and well proportioned. We also saw twelve<br/>
Arabians and we visited all the stables containing her<br/>
Majesty's horses which were one hundred and fifty<br/>
in number</p>

<p>We next viewed the appartments<br/>
containing the harness for 150 horses. There was<br/>
the full set of state harness, for eight cream coloured<br/>
Hanavarians, made by order of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and was<br/>
covered with gold plate and the harness of each horse<br/>
weighed 150 lbs. Every set was very expensive being<br/>
covered with gold plate</p>

<p>A birds eye view of the Queens<br/>
riding ground we took as we passed along and saw<br/>
one of the Lords and others of the Household riding<br/>
out. Entering the coach houses we saw her Majestys<br/>
private coaches a number of which were very grand<br/>
and costly and lastly came our inspection of the State <br/>
Coach.</p>

<p><strike>The First</strike> Apostles of the Church <br/>
of Latter-day Saints</p>

<p>ever met or will meet as a quorum complete of <br/>
The High Council of the Church with nine of <br/>
its members present and in General Conference <br/>
legislate for the Church in the capacity of a full <br/>
quorum. <strike>in a foreign land.</strike> Moreover of the quorum <br/>
of the Twelve Apostles of that date the 9 who at this <br/>
General Conerence transacted business as a full council <br/>
were the only ones of that quorum who stood faithful <br/>
and of those 9 [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] <br/>
have since departed to fill their calling in another <br/>
sphere. They therefore in this life can never <br/>
meet and act again as on that day.</p>

<p>Future Generation deeply interested <br/>
in the capital items of the history of this Church <br/>
will doubtless deem it worthy of marked record and of <br/>
great historical importance to find authoritative data <br/>
that the First Apostles of the Church ordained under <br/>
the presidenlcy of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] never sat as a <br/>
full council nor legislated in their quorum capacity only <br/>
in America and [[England|England]] and in this only time in <br/>
Foreign Missions Brigham Young sat at their head <br/>
and then they organized the British Mission prior <br/>
to the return of seven of their number to America and <br/>
from that British Mission has branched out the foreign <br/>
missions of the Church throughout Europe.</p>

<p>On the day after the Conference I <br/>
called at the book store of Elder Parley P. Pratt 47 <br/>
[[Oxford Street, London, Middlesex, England|Oxford Street]] and found his house full of Elders many <br/>
of whom were about parting to go to their fields of <br/>
labour.</p>

to sterrotype the ""Doctrines and Covenants"" of the <br/>
Church</p>

<p>On the evening of March the 10th<br/>
I saw in the South west quarter of the heavens<br/>
a stream of light in the form of a broad sword<br/>
with the hilt downwards and the blade raised<br/>
pointing from west south west. At an angle of<br/>
45 degrees from the horison and extending within<br/>
two or three degrees to the zeneth of the degree where<br/>
the sign appeared. It was discovered at 7 o'clock<br/>
and gradually disappeared from half past seven<br/>
and at nine o'clock it was entirely gone.</p>

<p>This sign of a drawn sword<br/>
in the heavens appeared for several evenings<br/>
and on the 14th it moved up near the moon and<br/>
formed itself into a large ring around the moons<br/>
balls immediately appeared in the ring opposite<br/>
each other something in the form of sundogs<br/>
and another half ring issued from those balls<br/>
something in the shape of a horseshoe extending<br/>
outside of the first ring with one line running<br/>
through the centre of the moon</p>

in the heavens and as sure as He ever spoke by<br/>

sign thereof.""</p>

<p>A week or two afterwards there were<br/>
also remarkable signs in the heavens. [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>

<p>The Twelve spent some time in council in <br/>
the forepart of the day and in the afternooon they with all the <br/>
American brethren present went to Bro [[William Miller|Millers]] and took tea<br/>
and had an interesting time together</p>

<p>Before we left the Twelve laid their <br/>
hands upon the head of [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and blessed him in the <br/>
name of the Lord as he had been set apart to go to the Holy <br/>
Land, [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] as a messenger and forerunner of the <br/>
return of [[Israel|Israel]] to build up the waste places of Jerusalem<br/>
Much of the Spirit rested upon us when we blessed him <br/>

<p>I walked into the city with Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]] and each of us bought a pair of pebble spectacles and <br/>
a small spyglass.</p>

<p>I wrote a letter to Elder [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey]] <br/>
and also to my wife and receved 4 pounds 10 shillings from <br/>
Elder [[John Horlick|John Hollick]] by the hand of Elder [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]]</p>

<p>Good Friday Elder Kimball baptized Brother <br/>
[[Thomas Brotherton|Brotherton]] who then came to Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and <br/>
was confirmed. We dined at his house after which we <br/>
all walked to the Zool<strike>l</strike>ogical Gardins. There were fifteen <br/>
of the American brethren present. We returned and <br/>
took tea at Bro M<sup>c</sup> Kendricks</p>

<p>Next day I accompanied Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] <br/>
to the railway station and he took his departure for <br/>
[[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]].</p>

<p>On the Sunday I preached in the <br/>
Carpenters Hall in the morning and was followed <br/>
by Parley P. Pratt and in the afternoon the sacrament <br/>
was administered and amny testified of the work <br/>
In the evening Elder [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] preached from [[Daniel (OT)|Daniel]] <br/>
upon the Kingdoms Symbolized in that book and <br/>
Elders Kimball and Young followed him.</p>

<p>I spent the 14th counting out the <br/>
Millennial Star and had 76 volumes as my share <br/>
of the property and I had sold 40 Hymn Books <br/>
to P. Pratt a few days previous</p>",
42828.0,377,,"<p>on the morning of March the 23rd</p>

<p>There were also other signs and it was singular<br/>
that in the case of the sign of the sword that on the opposite<br/>
side of the horison there was seen a black streak about the size<br/>
and shape of the light one. The one was black as darkness<br/>
while the other had considerable the appearance of the <br/>
blaze of a comet.</p>

<p>On the 12th of April the steam boat<br/>
Amaram arrived at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with 230 Saints from [[England|England]]<br/>

<p>The next day the Steam boat Maid of<br/>
[[Iowa|Iowa]] arrived with 250 Saints who had been in [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis]]<br/>
during the Winter. Many were my old acquaintances<br/>
and friends. [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and Dr. [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]]<br/>
were among the number.</p>

<p>The Saints newly arrived were made<br/>
welcome and the following day they assembled and<br/>
was addressed by the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]].</p>

just received information of the death of Elder [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Lorenzo<br/>
Barnes]] in England <strike>and</strike> who was the first missionary<br/>
of the Church from America <strike>who</strike> that died in a foreign<br/>
land. After reading the letter which brought <br/>
the melancholy news he addressed the assembly<br/>
of Saints in the Temple on the 16 of April in a<br/>
very feeling discourse. Among other Remarks<br/>
he said</p>

<p>""He should have been more reconciled<br/>
to the death of Elder Barnes could his body have been<br/>
laid in the grave in Nauvoo or among the Saints</p>

which branching <strike>over</strike> ^out^ at the top sustain the roof and<br/>
four angular trees are loaded with trophies allusive<br/>

42828.0,330,,"<p>Next day we bid adieu to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] <br/>
We left Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and family in good health <br/>
and spirits. We left him with a store of Books of Mormon <br/>
Hymn Book Voice of Warning Poems Tracts and Stars <br/>
for sale.</p>

<p>Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]] myself [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] <br/>
and [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] took train to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] and <br/>
brother G. A. Smith and myself took up our abode <br/>
at Bro Haringtons near Scotland Road</p>

<p>We arrived just in time to attend <br/>
a splendid tea meeting of the Saints at the Music <br/>
Hall Liverpool. This Hall the Church had rented <br/>
for the Latter day Saints meeting place and it would <br/>
hold about 2000. There <strike>was</strike> ^were^ now sat down to <br/>
table at this tea meeting about 200 Saints</p>

<p>This was the first time I had <br/>
visited Liverpool since I first landed. It gave me <br/>
peculiar feelings to set down to tthe festive board with <br/>
200 Saints and to think that when we first landed <br/>
there was not a soul in that great place who belonged <br/>
to the Church but ourselves</p>

<p>After tea we were introduced to <br/>
this intelligent body of Saints and the Twelve addressed <br/>
them in a few words.</p>

<p>After the meeting our quorum <br/>
met for a few minutes and concluded to sail on <br/>
the following Thursday</p>

<p>The next day was an exceedingly <br/>
busy day for the Saints were coming in from the <br/>
various parts of [[England|England]] to sail for [[New York|New York]] on board <br/>
the ship Rochester with us among whom was <br/>
brother [[Edward Ockey|Ockey]] <strike>and family</strike> and brother [[John Fidoe|Fidoe]] and family <br/>
from [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]</p>

<p>With Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] I visited the <br/>
agents of the ship on which we were going and we <br/>
detained the ship one day on our account</p>

<p>This company was disposed to do <br/>
all they could to favour us for it was to their interest</p>",
42828.0,378,,"<p>relative to receiving an honourable burial with <strike>his</strike> ^my^ fathers<br/>
<strike>He</strike> ^I^ want<strike>ed</strike> to be laying by the sie of <strike>his</strike> ^my^ father when<br/>
the trumpet of God <strike>should</strike> ^shall^ sound and the voice of<br/>
God say ""Ye Saints arise so that when the toomb<br/>
<strike>should </strike>^shall^ burst <strike>he</strike> ^I^ <strike>could</strike> ^can^ arise from the grave and<br/>
first salute <strike>his</strike> ^my^ father and say O my Father! and<br/>
<strike>his</strike> ^my^ father O my Son! as they <strike>took</strike> ^we take^ each other by<br/>
the hand.</p>

<p><strike>He</strike> ^I^ wish<strike>ed</strike> next to salute <strike>his</strike> my brothers<br/>
and sisters and then the Saints.</p>

<p>It was upon this principle that<br/>
the ancients were so particular to have an honourable<br/>
burial with their fathers as in the case of Joseph. <br/>
Before his death he made his kindred promise to<br/>
carry <strike>to carry</strike> his bones to the land of [[Canaan|Canaan]] and<br/>
they did so. They embalmed his body and took<br/>
it to the land of Canaan and buried it with his fathers.</p>

<p>There is a glory in this which<br/>
many do not comprehend. It is true that on the<br/>
resurrection the Saints will be caught up to meet<br/>
the Lord and they will all be brought together though<br/>
their bodies were scattered upon the face of the whole<br/>
earth. Yet they could not as readily salute<br/>
each other as though ^they^ had laid down and rose up<br/>
together from the same bed.</p>

<p>To bring it to the understanding<br/>
it would be as though two who were very dear friends<br/>
indeed should lie down upon the same bed at night<br/>
locked in each others embrace talking of their love and<br/>
in the morning awaking together they could immediately<br/>
renew their conversations ^even^ while rising from their bed.<br/>
But if they were alone and in seperate appartments they<br/>
could not as readily salute each other as though they <br/>
were together.</p>

<strike>he</strike> ^I^ live and have an opportunity of gathering <strike>his</strike> ^my^<br/>
friends together who had died <strike>he</strike> ^I^ intended to do so<br/>
but should <strike>he</strike> ^I^ not live to do it <strike>him</strike>^my^self <strike>he</strike> ^I^ hoped that</p>",

of the coachmen grooms and those connected with the Mews</p>

<p>Mr [[James West|James West]] her Majestys state coachman<br/>
invited us to dine with him and we did so. We saw<br/>
all of his State dresses which were richly trimmed and<br/>
ornamented with gold. One coat was exceedingly heavy<br/>
in consequene of the weight of gold trimmings. When we<br/>
left him he made us a present of three small ornaments<br/>
for [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and Willford<br/>
Woodruff. They were made of fine polished brass<br/>
about 4 inches in circumference with a lion in the centre<br/>
and a crown upon the top. They were worn as ornaments<br/>
upon the Queen's State Coach. While at the Mews<br/>
we were allowed the privilege of being weighed in the<br/>
scales in which [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, b. 1819|Prince Albert]] was weighed. Elder<br/>
Kimballs weight was 160 mine was 142 which<br/>
was 2 pounds more than I had ever weighed before</p>

<p>The State coachman informed <br/>
me that her [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Majesty]] would be quite familiar and<br/>
even sociable in some respects with some of her subjects<br/>
but was kept distant by her Ministry</p>

<p>From the Royal Mews we walked<br/>
to the National Gallery and having viewed the<br/>
paintings we returned home somewhat weary for<br/>
we had walked ten miles in a rainy day</p>

<p>Next day we had a long and pleasant<br/>
days walk in accompanying brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
in his visit to [[St. Paul|St. Paul's]] and other noted places.</p>

<p>From the body of the cathedral<br/>
we ascended to the Whispering Gallery thence to the<br/>
Golden Gallery and then to the Ball where we all<br/>
three sat together 400 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Descending we visited the Library<br/>
the Bell the Clock and finally every part of the<br/>
building and lastly the Crypt among all the toombs<br/>
It cost 7/6 each to visit every part of the cathedral</p>

<p>From St. Pauls to the Monument<br/>
to its top and descending thence to [[London Bridge, London, Middlesex, England|London Bridge]]</p>",
42828.0,331,,"<p>as we had already given them many passengers anothe probability <br/>
was that we should give them many more.</p>

<p>They gave us and all our Company the <br/>
second <strike>deck</strike> ^cabin^ and for our quorum they fitted up a seperate room <br/>
at half price</p>

<p>Thus there was a great difference between <br/>
the circumstances of our landing in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] on the 11th of <br/>
January 1<strike>4</strike>840 as strangers in a strange land and penniless <br/>
and that of our setting sail on the 20th of <strike>May</strike> ^April^ 1841 with <br/>
a ship load of Saints and influence sufficient to detain the <br/>
sailing of the vessel at our will.</p>

<p>Truly the Lord had blessed us in a<br/>
degree unlooked for. Indeed it was a miracle what the Lord <br/>
had wrought by our hands since our arrival a little over a <br/>
year before and I was filled with amazem<strike>i</strike>ent as I looked <br/>
back for during that time we had established churches <br/>
in nearly all the principal towns and cities in [[England|England]] <br/>
baptized more than 5000 souls published 5000 Books <br/>
of Mormon 3000 Hymn Books 2500 vols of the<br/>
Millennial Star and about 50,000 tracts besides <br/>
gathering to America 1000 members of the Church and <br/>
establishing ^a great influence^ among the shiping companies of Liverpool <br/>
which in a few years after had grown to such importance<br/>
as to become quite a ruling power not only in Liverpool <br/>
but in England generally. Indeed to such proportions <br/>
did the emigration power and notoriety of the Church <br/>
grow that in its history our emigration agent has been <br/>
summoned before a committee of the House of Commons <br/>
upon emigration policy and the company of the Great <br/>
Eastern Steam Ship has sought of our people to charter <br/>
their Leviathan of the Sea</p>

<p>I spent the following day in running <br/>
to and fro through the city assisting the Saints. I <br/>
walked four miles in the evening on the sea shore with <br/>
a company of Saints and baptized two persons one <br/>
was Sister [[Elizabeth Ockey Amphlett|Elizabeth Ockey]]. Her sister [[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann]] accompanied <br/>
her to the water and they both much desire to sail <br/>
with us to America with their brother [[Edward Ockey|Edward]], but</p>",
42828.0,379,,"<p>some of his would ^will^</p>

<p><strike>He</strike> ^I^ wish<strike>ed</strike> all the Saints to be comforted<br/>
with the victory they w<strike>ere</strike>ill to gain by the resurrection.<br/>
It is sufficient to encourage the Saint to overcome in<br/>
the midst of every trial trouble and tribulation. Though<br/>
thunders roar and earthquakes bellow, lightnings flash<br/>
and wars be on every hand yet suffer not a joint to tremble<br/>
nor let your heart faint for the great Elohiem will<br/>
deliver you; and if not before, the resurrection will<br/>
set you eternally free from all those things and<br/>
from pain sorrow and death.</p>

<p>I have laboured hard and sought<br/>
every way to try to prepare this people to comprehend<br/>
the things which God is unfolding to me.</p>

<p>In speaking of the resurrection<br/>
I would say that God hath s^h^own unto me a<br/>
vision of the resurrection of the dead; and I saw<br/>
the graves open and the Saints as they arose took<br/>
each other by the hand even before they got up<br/>
or while getting up and great joy and glory rested<br/>
upon them.</p>",
42828.0,286,,"<p>which we crossed and continued to the Southwark<br/>
Suspension Bridge which we walked under viewed<br/>
and then crossed it. The Bridge is forty five rods<br/>
in length. We then dined in the city and<br/>
afterwards took a cab and rode to the Museum<br/>
and went through every appartment of it. This<br/>
ended the day and we returned to our lodgings<br/>
in a cab very weary and some what ^foot^ sore for<br/>
we had walked twelve miles and ascended<br/>
and descended twelve hundred steps. However<br/>
we enjoyed a good night's rest</p>

<p>On the morrow we walked over<br/>
Blackfriars and called at Zion's chapel to attend<br/>
a sacrament meeting of Mr. Aitken's society but <br/>
they knowing who we were would not let us in for<br/>
they feared lest we should break up their society<br/>
by the power of our mission.</p>

<p>Thus turned away we crossed home<br/>
and held meeting in the evening when I preached and<br/>
Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] bore strong testimony<br/>
to the people.</p>

<p>Next day Brother Brigham left<br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] for [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|Cheltenham]] and I visited Mr [[James Albon|James<br/>
Albon]] a minister of the Independent order who with<br/>
his household beleived our doctrine and on the Sunday<br/>
we found more than ever an interest being awakened<br/>
in London, and our prayer meeting the next evening<br/>
was attended by the Reverend James Albon who received<br/>
our testimony. We walked home with him and<br/>
found his household growing in the faith and ready<br/>
for the work of the Lord.</p>

<p>Two days after in the evening we<br/>
baptized four two of whom were Mr and Mrs Morgan<br/>
with whom we lodged <strike>and their apprentice</strike> ^[[Christopher Smith|Christopher Smith]]^ and [[Henry Corner Jr.|Henry<br/>
Corner Jun<sup>r</sup>]]</p>",
42828.0,332,,"<p>they were not ready. I retired to bed at midnight very <br/>
weary with my day's labour</p>

<p>Next day seven of the Twelve and <br/>
120 Saints with them got our baggage on board to set <br/>
sail but the wind being contrary we staid on shore. <br/>
This was an exceedingly busy day in settling my business <br/>
and preparing for my voyage homewards.</p>

<p>Among other matters I received the<br/>
following Books of Mormon: 12 Morocca 9 shillings <br/>
each; 25 Gilt Edge 7 shillings; 89 marble edge six and <br/>
six pence; 35 Sheep 5 shillings each. Total value fifty <br/>
one pounds sixteen shillings and six pence. Of these <br/>
I made the following distributions; To [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Ezra Carter]] <br/>
and family, 9 Morocca lettered; My father and family <br/>
5 Morocca lettered; [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] 2 gilt edge 6 marble <br/>
edge &amp; 4 sheep skin bound; [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] 4 marble <br/>
edge and 2 sheep skin; and to others of the Saints I <br/>
made similar presents of Books of Mormon in all <br/>
to the number of 42.</p>

<p>The sisters [[Elizabeth Ockey Amphlett|Elizabeth]] and [[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann<br/>
Ockey]] made me a presrent of a nice neck-scarf silk <br/>
handkerchief and gold pin and their brother [[Edward Ockey|Edward]]<br/>
presented me with a purse of 50 sover<strike>e</strike>igns. Truly <br/>
this was liberality not often met; and as some of my <br/>
brethren were more needy than myself I devided a <br/>
portion of his generous gift with my companions; to <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] £5; Willard Richards £5; and George <br/>
A Smith £5. <strike>I said</strike> Truly the Lord ha<strike>s</strike>d been <br/>
good to us all On this mission and had given us all <br/>
that we needed.</p>

the Twelve [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] counciled us to take our mission<br/>
to the east to obtain means to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and<br/>
[[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] as we were appointed by the General<br/>
Conference on the 6th of April. At that anniversary<br/>
of the rise of the Church. The following persons were named<br/>
of the quorum of the Twelve for this mission to hold<br/>
Conferences in the east obtain means &amp;c:</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]]<br/>
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[William B. Smith|William Smith]] Willford<br/>
Woodruff and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]. [[John Edward Page|John E Page]]<br/>
was to join us in the east.</p>

<p>There were also ^some^ appointed for other<br/>
missions. [[Reuben Hedlock|Reuben Hedlock]] [[Samuel James|S James]] and [[John Carnes|J Carnes]]<br/>
were appointed to go to [[England|England]] and [[Addison Pratt|Addison Pratt]]<br/>
and three others were appointed to go to the [[Sandwich Islands|Sandwich<br/>
Islands]].</p>

<p>Brigham Young Heber C Kimball<br/>
Joseph Young G. A. Smith and [[Peter Haws|Peter Haws]] and myself<br/>
went to [[Augusta, Hancock County, Illinois|Agusta]] to hold Conference on Sunday<br/>
the 30th. He found about 200 Saints in this place.<br/>
They had started a flourishing vilage three saw<br/>
mills and two flowering mills and one of the best<br/>
water privileges I ever saw. We returned to<br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] on the first of May.</p>

<p>A company of about one hundred<br/>
gentlemen and ladies on the Maid of Iowa took a pleasure<br/>
excursion to [[Burlington, Kane County, Illinois|Burlington]]. Joseph his [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|lady]], his<br/>
[[Lucy Mack Smith|mother]] and family were of the party.</p>

<p>The Council of the Twelve met<br/>
two days after and appointed missions to England<br/>
[[Scotland|Scotland]] and the Pacific Isles.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 14th I was at [[Lima, Adams County, Illinois|Lima]] <br/>
with Joseph to hold meeting there. George A Smith<br/>
and [[Joseph Bates Noble|B. Nobles]] had also accompanied him while Brigham<br/>
Young Heber C. Kimball and Orson Pratt were filling<br/>
appointments elsewhere.</p>

<p>After singing and prayer Joseph delivered</p>",
42828.0,287,,"<p>The afternoon <strike>On</strike> ^of^ the following day Dr [[William Copeland|Copeland]] spent the<br/>
with us and he received our testimony and in the evening<br/>
we preached at our meeting place.</p>

<p>I had visited the Rev. [[James Albon|James Albon]]<br/>
several times and given him an account of the rise<br/>
and progress of the Church of Christ of Latter-day<br/>
Saints. He beleived in our mission and offered<br/>
me his chapel to preach in which would seat about<br/>
two thousand.</p>

<p>Sunday morning we accompanied<br/>
our reverend friend and convert to his chapel and were<br/>
introduced to the Commttee one of whom was a preacher<br/>
who had travelled much in [[Russia|Russia]] and other parts of<br/>
the world. At the close of the meeting the Rev. James<br/>
Albion gave out an appointment for us to preach<br/>
on the next Sabbath evening</p>

<p>In the afternoon we met with<br/>
the Saints confirmed four and had a full house<br/>
and in the evening we preached again and a good<br/>
feeling prevailed</p>

<p>After meeting the Rev James Albon<br/>
called upon us at our room and told us that he<br/>
had given out our appointment to preach in his<br/>
chapel and had informed his congregation that he<br/>
was a Latter-day Saint and should be baptized<br/>
and join our Church and that they need no longer<br/>
consider him a member of their body unless they<br/>
with him joined the Saints. He told us<br/>
this made a division among the Committee:<br/>
some were for going with him and some against<br/>
following their pastor into the true fold which<br/>
he had found.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the Monday<br/>
was spent with Dr Copeland with whom we went<br/>
to the ""Concerts d'Hiver"" and heard a fine performance<br/>
of a magnificient band of about 100 mostly German<br/>
and French conducted by Mr Ellason. It was<br/>

of April.</p>

<p>Next day Wednesday the 21st the wind being favourable <br/>
we weighed anchor at 12 o'clock and started on our voyage, and <br/>
had a good bre<strike>i</strike>^eze^ throughout the day but most of the passengers <br/>
were sea sick</p>

<p>The Rochester was a fast sailing vessel <br/>
of about 1000 tons and there was on board 1<strike>0</strike>20 Saints including <br/>
seven of the Twelve; 160 not of our people and the ships <br/>
company making in all 307 souls.</p>

<p>On the seventh day of our voyage <br/>
we had <strike>all the pleasure with a touch or two of the <br/>
disasters of</strike></p>

<p><u>A</u> <u>Storm</u> <u>at</u> <u>Sea</u>.</p>

<p>In the morning we found strong head winds <br/>
which soon increased to a powerful storm and the scene <br/>
which followed was full of grandeur and considerable <br/>
discomfiture to our company.</p>

<p>The sails were taken in as soon as <br/>
possible and it took 16 men to close reef the main topsail</p>

<p>The tempest in its rage was now all <br/>
powerful &amp; the sea piled up into mountains. Ever and <br/>
anon our ship was thrown up on the crest of one of <br/>
those ocean mountains and then pitched into the Val<strike>e</strike>ley<br/>
beneath rocking tremendously and occassionly shiping <br/>
seas</p>

<p>In the midst of this was a cry for help <br/>
was heard in our cabin. I rushed to the scene from <br/>
whence the cry came and found the ropes giving <br/>
way which held the luggage piled up between decks <br/>
Had this broken loose one surge would have hurlled <br/>
heavy trunks barrels &amp;c into the births of the men <br/>

the lives of many. On seeing the foundation <br/>
of this mass give way [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and <br/>
myself sprang to the place of danger and braced</p>",

<p><strike>Gems</strike> Items<br/>
of<br/>
<u>A</u> <u>Discourse by Joseph</u></p>

<p>""It is not wisdom that we should have all knowledge<br/>
presented at once before us but that we should have<br/>
a little at a time. Then we can comprehend it""</p>

<p>[The speaker then read the Second Epistle<br/>
of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]] 1st ch. <strike>from the 16th to the last verse</strike> and<br/>
dwelt upon the 19th verse. Among other remarks<br/>
upon the words of the Apostle, ""And to your faith<br/>
knowledge"" &amp;c the Prophet said.]</p>

<p>""The Principle of knowledge is the principle<br/>
of salvation. This doctrine can be comprehended for any<br/>
one who <strike>cannot obtain</strike> ^will receive^ knowledge to be saved will be<br/>
damned.</p>

<p>The principle of salvation is given to<br/>
us through the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Salvation<br/>
is nothing more nor less than to triumph over all our<br/>
enemies and put them under our feet in this world<br/>
and a knowledge to triumph over all evil Spirits in<br/>
the world to come: Then we are saved; as in the<br/>
case of Jesus Christ. He was to reign until he<br/>
had put all enemies under his feet and the last enemy<br/>
was death.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is a principle here<br/>
that few men have thought of. No person can have<br/>
this salvation except through a tabernacle.</p>

<p>Now in this world mankind are<br/>
naturaly selfish and ambitious and striving to excel<br/>
one above another yet some are willing to build up <br/>
others as well as themselves.</p>

<p>So in the other world there is a variety<br/>
of spirits some of whom seek to excel. This was</p>",
42828.0,288,,"<p>I sat two hours and half for my<br/>
portrait on the Wednesday and had an interesting chat<br/>
with the artist Mr Pistrucci an Italian, in the midst<br/>
of which brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] called for me and I took<br/>
a walk with him and Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland]] and his [[Mrs. William Copeland|wife]]<br/>
over Blackfriars Bridge.</p>

<p>On our return home we lost<br/>
brother Kimball and sister Copeland in the crowd<br/>
and in looking for them I lost the Doctor &amp;<br/>
brother Kimball sister Copeland so that there were<br/>
no two of the four together. After awhile however<br/>
we all luckily met at [[Covent Garden, London, Middlesex, England|Covent Garden]] and saw<br/>
the wonderful performance of [[William Shakespeare|Shakspears]] Night<br/>
Dream and Madam [[Lucia Elizabeth Bartolozzi Vestris Mathews|Vestris]] the celebrated actress<br/>
and popular favourite.</p>

and myself went into the streets to see the busy<br/>
multitude returned to our room and took supper in<br/>

of falling among thieves.</p>

<p>Christmas Day in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]</p>

<p>Christmas is the greatest day of the year in [[England|England]]<br/>
and this was the first Christmas day I ever spent in a <br/>
foreign land.</p>

<p>In the morning the church bells throughout<br/>
London chanted for meeting and the Saints also met for<br/>
service. After morning service comes what gives the<br/>
halo of glory and jolity to Old Christmas—the dinner. The<br/>
service of the day is something like the blessing before meat<br/>
but the Christmas ^dinner^ is an institution with the nation and<br/>
Christmas holds his feast of State in every city town and<br/>
hamlet—in every palace mansion and cottage and comfortless<br/>
is the wretched place which merry Christmas enters not</p>

<p>Our Christmas dinner was eat with brother<br/>
Morgan and family and the evening was spent with the<br/>
Rev. Mr. [[James Albon|Albon]] in conversing about the things of God.</p>",
42828.0,334,,"<p>ourselves against the barrels and held them for a  few moments until they were secured. I then went on <br/>
the deck to the Captain and informed him of the situation <br/>
of things below and he sent the sailors with some <br/>
ropes and they secured the pile.</p>

<p>Afterwards I again went to the aft<br/>
quarter deck to behold the raging of the tempest and <br/>
the wonders of the deep and the riding of our bark <br/>
on the mountain billows. It was the grandest <br/>
scenery I ever beheld upon the sea</p>

<p>Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] [[Willard Richards|Richards]]<br/>
and [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] <strike>was</strike> ^were^ with me on deck for a time but <br/>
all had now gone below with the exception of Elder <br/>
Willard Richards myself the captain and crew</p>

<p>We were shipping heavy seas. It <br/>
was now past sunset and I stood in the middle of <br/>
the aft quarter deck holding the captain's speaking<br/>
trumpet it one hand and to a fast bench with the <br/>
other when we shipped a tremendious sea on the <br/>
windward side of us which passed clear over the<br/>
quarter deck upon which I stood.  On seeing that <br/>
we could not escape it Elder Richards threw himself <br/>
under the shelter of the bulwarks, and the body <br/>
of the wave went clear over him without wetting <br/>
him more than a little but as I could not <br/>
take the same advantage I threw myself <br/>
upon the deck and held fast to the seat until <br/>
the sea passed over me and left me drenched <br/>
with the Surge. I now though it time to leave <br/>
my seat of observations for the day. So I <br/>
went below and went to bed for I was thoroughly <br/>
wet.</p>

<p>I did not sleep however but little <br/>
for the ship rocked at a dreadful rate; boxes barrels <br/>
and tins were tumbling from one end of the cabin <br/>
to the other and in the steerage about fifteen births <br/>
were thrown down. I at one surge with men <br/>
woman and children flung into a heap. There</p>",
42828.0,382,,"<p>the case with the Devil. When he fell he sought for<br/>
things which were unlawful. Hence he was cast<br/>
down and it is said that he drew away many<br/>
with him and the greatness of his punishment<br/>
is that he shall not have a tabernacle. This<br/>
is his punishment.</p>

<p>So the Devil thinking to thwart<br/>
the decree of God goeth up and down the earth<br/>
seeking whom he may destroy. Any person<br/>
whom he can find who will yeild to him he<br/>
will find and take possession of the body and reign<br/>
there glorifying mightily forgeting that he has a<br/>
stolen body. By and by some one having authority<br/>
comes along and casts him out and restores the<br/>
tabernacle to its rightful owner. The devil steals<br/>
a tabernacle because he has not one of his own but<br/>
when he has stolen it he is liable to be turned out<br/>
of doors""</p>

<p>-[Upon the 19th verse the Prophet<br/>
rememarked]</p>

<p>Now there is some grand secret<br/>
here and a key to unlock the subject. Notwithstanding<br/>
the Apostle exhorts them to add to their faith virtue<br/>
knowledge temperance &amp;c yet he exhorts them to make<br/>
their calling and election sure. Though they had<br/>
heard the audible voice from heaven bearing testimony<br/>
that Jesus was the Son of God yet he says we have <br/>
a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well<br/>
that ye take heed as unto a light shining in a<br/>
dark place.</p>

<p>Now wherein could they have a<br/>
more sure word of prophecy than to hear the voice of<br/>
God saying this is my beloved Son? Now for the<br/>
secret and grand key.</p>

<p>Though they might have heard<br/>
the voice of the Father and know that Jesus was<br/>
the Son of God this would be no evidence that their<br/>
calling and election was made sure and that</p>",
42828.0,289,,"<p>The Sunday following in the evening we preached<br/>
by the appointment of its minister in the Indipendant chapel to<br/>
the largest congregation we had discoursed before, in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]].<br/>
There were present priests and people of many denominations. I<br/>
addressed them for about the space of one hour. A Wesleyan<br/>
Minister arose and opposed me which had a good effect<br/>
for the congregation seeing the spirit he was of turned<br/>
against him and the Committee refused him the permission<br/>
to speak there any more. I was much bound by the<br/>
opposing spirit still the conduct of ^the^ enemy gave us friends</p>

was said to have been the largest Temperance meeting<br/>
ever held in London and the next two days brought us<br/>

42828.0,335,,"<p>were however no lives lost or bones broken. This was the <br/>
<strike>eighth</strike> ^seventh^ day in succession that we had strong head winds</p>

<p>Next day we had fair wind for the <br/>
first time and the sun shined pleasantly but the sea <br/>
was very rough from the gale</p>

<p>One day near this date I was requested <br/>
<strike>to</strike>by the brethren to carry the dishes to the cooks galley <br/>
So I got my hands full of dishes of various kinds and<br/>
just as I had reached the door of the galley the ship <br/>
gave a tremendious lunge so that she was thrown on <br/>
her beam ends with her stud sails in the water. This <br/>
unexpected pitch of the ship plunged me head foremost<br/>
about ten feet the whole length of the galley against <br/>
its side with the cook upon me</p>

<p>This was my first introduction <br/>
to the cook since I had been to sea. I beged his pardon <br/>
for such an abrupt enterance and withdrew leaving <br/>
the cook with three smashed fingers (caused by <br/>
trying to save me in the fall) to pick up my <br/>
dishes at leasure which were scattered from one end <br/>
of his galley to the other. I had no desire for a <br/>
long time to come to pay the cook a similar visit</p>

<p>Passing over the remaining incidents <br/>
of a voyage accross the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in an emigrant <br/>
ship we landed in [[New York|New York]] on the 20th of <br/>
May.</p>

<p>Next day [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and <br/>
myself took up our abode with Elder [[Lucian Rose Foster|L. R. Foster]]<br/>
who was glad to see us and made us welcome<br/>
and brothers [[Brigham Young|Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
took up lodgings at the house of Elder [[George Washington Joshua Adams|G. J. Adams]]</p>

<p>At this time I met my brothers in <br/>
law [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra]] and [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus Carter]] and also Dr [[Charles Wesley Fabyan|Charles<br/>
Fabyan]]</p>

<p>I had the purusal of the 12 and <br/>
13th Nos. of the Times and Seasons giving an <br/>
account of the laying of the corner stones of the <br/>
[[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|House of the Lord]] in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] in the presence</p>",
42828.0,383,,"<p>they had a part with Christ and was a point heir with him.<br/>
They would then need that more sure word of prophecy that<br/>
they were sealed in the heavens and had the promise<br/>
of Eternal Life in the Kingdom of God. Then having<br/>
this promise sealed unto them it was as an anchor to<br/>
their soul sure and steadfast. Though the thunders<br/>
might roll &amp; lightenings flash, earthquakes bellow and war<br/>
gather thick around yet this knowledge would support the<br/>
soul in every hour of trial and tribulation</p>

<p>Then knowledge through our Lord<br/>
and Saviour Jesus Christ is the grand key which unlocks<br/>
the glories and mysteries of the kingdom of heaven</p>

<p>Compare this principle of knowledge<br/>
which thus unlocks the glories and mysteries of the<br/>
Kingdom with Christendom at the present time and<br/>
where are they with all their religion piety and sacredness<br/>
Yet at the same time they are crying out against<br/>
Prophets Apostles Angels Revelations Visions &amp;c<br/>
Why they are just ripening for the damnation of<br/>
hell. They will be damned for they reject the<br/>
most glorious principle of the Gospel of Jesus Christ<br/>
and treat with disdain and trample under foot the<br/>
main key which unlocks the heavens and puts<br/>
into our possession the glories of the celestial world<br/>
Yes I say such will be damned with all their<br/>
professed godliness</p>

<p>""Then I would ^also^ exhort you to go on<br/>
and continue to call upon God until you make your<br/>
calling and election sure for yourselves by obtaining<br/>
this more sure word of prophecy and wait<br/>
patiently for the promise until you obtain it""</p>

<p>Many other choice remarks were made<br/>
on this occassion which I did not note down.</p>

[[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castle Froom]] Herefordshire at the house of Elder <br/>
[[John W. Latson|J. W. Latson]] in the presence of the quorum of the <br/>
Twelve.</p>

<p>This was the first marriage <br/>
ceremony I ever officiated in and I was much <br/>
interested in the welfare of the bride and bridegroom <br/>
for they were both my children in the Gospel and <br/>
Elder Edward Ockey had not only been munificient <br/>
in gifts to me but he has also given between two <br/>
and three hundred pounds to help the poor <br/>
Saints to emigrate</p>

the Council of the Twelve met; and afterwards at <br/>
our meeting place the National Hall Canal Street <br/>

Saints from [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and <br/>

with brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and brother [[Isaac Morley|Morely]] we were treated<br/>
to the following.</p>

<p><u>Sayings of the Prophet</u></p>

<p>""The way to get along in any important matters<br/>
is to call unto yourself wise men experienced and<br/>
aged to assist in council in all times of trouble.</p>

<p>""Handsome me are not wise and<br/>
strong minded men. The strength of a strong minded<br/>
man will create course features like a rough and<br/>
strong bough of the oak. You will always discover<br/>
in the first glance at a man in the outline of <br/>
his features something of the mind of the man""</p>

<p>Excitement has almost become the<br/>
essence of my life. When that dies away I feel<br/>
almost lost. When a man is reined up continually<br/>
he becomes strong and gains power and knowledge<br/>
but when he relaxes for a season he loses much<br/>
of his power.</p>

<p>But in all matters whether temporal<br/>
or spiritual—preaching the Gospel or leading an<br/>
army to battle victory almost entirely depends upon<br/>
moderation and good discipline. In going to battle<br/>
move slowly dress up into line and though your<br/>
enemy rush upon you with fury meet them with<br/>
calm firmness. Let not confussion seize your<br/>
breast but receive them slow and firmly; then<br/>
strike a heavy blow and conquer.</p>

<p>A man can bear a heavy burden<br/>
by practice and by continuing to increase it.</p>

<p>The Church of Latter-Day Saints on this<br/>
new year's day 1841 in the City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] numbered 21<br/>
souls and I celebrated the commencement of the new<br/>
year by baptizing two into the fold of Christ. We dined<br/>
at Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland's]]</p>

<p>There was a heavy thunder storm on<br/>
the Sunday which damaged some of the churches in<br/>
the City. Notwithstanding we in the afternoon preached<br/>
in the Academy communed with the Saints and<br/>
confirmed two and ^preached^ again in the evening</p>

<p>We took tea with the Rev [[James Albon|James Albon]] <br/>
and Mr Spencer and were told that there was quite a<br/>
stir in the Indipendant Church where I had preached<br/>
the Sunday previous. Most of the Committee who<br/>
were eight in number were with their pastor beleiving<br/>
in our mission and there was a prospect of their being<br/>
baptized while others were much stirred up and<br/>
opposing.</p>

<p>A few days after in the evening we<br/>
accompanied the Rev. Mr Albon to London Dock to</p>",
42828.0,337,,"<p>born [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|son]] whom I had not before seen. After 2 years of<br/>
seperation from my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] it was a happy meeting now</p>

<p>Here I stayed with my [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|fatherin-law]] <br/>
until the 5th of July and then left for my native place <br/>
[[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] where I arrived on the 3rd day after.</p>

<p>While tarrying at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house <br/>
I married my sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice Woodruff]] to Mr [[Dwight Webster|Dwight<br/>
Webster]]. At</p>

<p>My Sister's Marriage</p>

<p>there were between 40 and fifty persons mostly our relatives <br/>
This was on the 4th of August 1841</p>

<p>A few days afterwards my aunt [[Beulah Hart|Bulah Hart]]<br/>
was baptized into the Church and on the 18th of the <br/>
month I bade farewell to my father's house after a stay <br/>
of forty one days. This was a longer visit than I had <br/>
paid to any of my friends for the last ten years.</p>

<p>Two days after we reached [[New Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven]] <br/>
the capitol of my native State which I had not seen <br/>
for 15 years and it gave me pleasure to see it once more</p>

<p>I arrived in [[New York|New York]] with my <br/>
family on the 12st. Here I learned the general news of <br/>
the day which was fully ominous and rumours of war between <br/>
[[England|England]] and America heard on every hand</p>

<p>The Millennial Stars from England <br/>
as well as the letters received informed me of the rapid <br/>
progress of the work in that country <strike>in the midst of <br/>
unparalelled</strike> opposition.</p>

<p>From the Times and Seasons I <br/>
gathered the items that the work in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] was progressing <br/>
in the midst of opposition and that all the returned <br/>
members of the Twelve excepting myself had arrived <br/>
there. It also brought the melancholy tidings of the <br/>
death of [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith]] editor of the Times and Seasons <br/>
The news generally informed me both of the success and <br/>
unequalled efforts both in America and England to overthrow <br/>
the Church. All earth and hell seemed united for one <br/>
great effort. Public meetings were being held and <br/>
news papers teening against us. </p>",
42828.0,385,,"<p>so constituted and were so determined and persevering<br/>
either in righteousness or wickedness that God visited<br/>
them immediately either with great judgements or blessings.</p>

<p>""If the present generation obtain any assistance from<br/>
God they will have to obtain it by faith.""</p>

<p>As I had spent most of my time for the last<br/>
ten years in the vineyard and would probably spend<br/>
much more in the future the brethren and myself<br/>
talked over the desireableness of my building a house<br/>
for my family to be comfortable in my absence.<br/>
Several profered to assist me to brick and other materials<br/>
and brother [[John Fidoe|John Fidoe]] would superintend the building<br/>
So on the 22nd of May we went on to the ground<br/>
and laid out the dimensions of the house.</p>

<p>Next day the Twelve set apart Elders<br/>
[[Noah Rogers|Noah Rogers]] [[Addison Pratt|Addison Pratt]] [[Benjamin Franklin Grouard|Benjamin F. Grouard]]<br/>
and [[Knowlton Hanks|Knowlton Hanks]] to take mission to the [[Sandwich Islands|Sandwich <br/>
Islands]] and Elders [[Reuben Hedlock|Hedlock]] and [[John Carnes|J Carnes]] to [[England|England]]<br/>
Elder Hedlock was appointed to preside after the British<br/>
Isles. The Spirit of the Lord was with us in<br/>
setting apart these brethren and the blessings pronounced<br/>
upon their heads were written by Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]]</p>

<p><u>A Trial</u><br/>
before<br/>
The Twelve and First Presidency</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 27th I met in council<br/>
with the Twelve and First Presidency when the case of<br/>
[[Benjamin Winchester|Benjamin Winchester]] was brought up on trial for<br/>
slandering the Saints in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] rejecting the <br/>
counsel of [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and the Twelve and for<br/>
tearing down instead of building up</p>

<p>Hyrum plead for mercy Joseph for<br/>
right and the Twelve decided according to the testimony</p>",
42828.0,292,,"<p>house of Mr Spencer to hold a meeting. There were<br/>
only six present and five were preachers. One by the<br/>
name of Canon was full of the devil and hypocr<strike>s</strike>isy<br/>
and he rejected our testimony and opposed the work<br/>
In fact we found that we could not go out to teach in <br/>
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] without the Devil coming to oppose us.</p>

<p>^Bro [[Brigham Young|Young]]^ In letter to brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] informed<br/>
us that the two brethren who went from [[Longton, Lancashire, England|Longton]] Lancashire<br/>
to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to spy out the land had returned strong in the faith<br/>
and also told us that 500 Books of Mormon were out of<br/>
press and in the process of binding.</p>

<p>About this time I baptized the [[Susanna Elizabeth Albon Ware|daughter]]<br/>
of the Rev. [[James Albon|James Albon]] and the day after Elder Kimball<br/>
started to [[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] to break up the ground there. The<br/>
following Sunday was the first time he preached when<br/>
four persons offered themselves for baptism.</p>

<p>They walked up and down the [[River Thames, England|river<br/>
Thames]] until 9 o'clock at night to find a place to<br/>
administer the ordinance but could not because of<br/>
the mud and ice. So on the morrow they came <br/>
with Elder Kimball to [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] to receive the ordinance<br/>
of the Gospel.</p>

<p>We immediately repared to our private<br/>
bath in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]] and Elder Kimball<br/>
baptized five persons one of whom was Dr. [[William Copeland|William <br/>
Copeland]].</p>

<p>This was indeed an interesting occasion<br/>
and we felt thankful to God to see the cloud begining<br/>
to break for we had struggled hard to do the little<br/>
which had been done.</p>

<p>On the 15th of the mouth we baptized<br/>
three more of brother [[Benjamin Morgan|Morgan's]] household and on the <br/>
following Sunday I preached to a full house and to many<br/>
new hearers. Several offered themselves for baptism<br/>
and there had been during the week added unto the<br/>
Church seven souls.</p>

<p>Next day Elder Kimball received<br/>
a letter from Elder Young who wished us to be</p>",
42828.0,338,,"<p>On the 9th of September a little company consisting <br/>
of myself [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|son]] and four others started on board <br/>
the boat Sandusky for [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]]. Our ultimate <br/>
destination was [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] were arrived on the <br/>
6th of the next month.</p>

<p>While on our journey up the <br/>
rivers and on board the Chesepeak bound for [[Chicago, Cook County, Illinois|Chicago]] <br/>
we stoped at [[Manitou Islands, Lake Michigan, Leelanau County, Michigan|Manit<strike>aw</strike>ou Island]] on account of rough weather <br/>
where we lay by until 4 o'clock in the afternoon <br/>
of the same day and then put off again</p>

<p>At 12 o'clock at night a tremendious<br/>
storm arose. The captain officers crew and passengers <br/>
all expected to go to the bottom and juedging from <br/>
outward appearances there were twenty chances to one<br/>
that we should be lost but I experienced no fear <br/>
and felt confident that the Lord would save us by <br/>
some means. We were in the gale 24 hours when <br/>
we succeeded in returning to Manitau Island.</p>

<p>When I left Nauvoo two years <br/>
before there were not more than a dozen houses in <br/>
the place but on my return to the City there <br/>
were several hundreds</p>

<p>We passed by the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] then <br/>
building and had a view of it; and then called <br/>
at the house of Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]. Here we <br/>
spent the night.</p>

<p>Brother Brigham was sick and <br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] were with <br/>
him. We laid hands upon him and he soon <br/>
recovered</p>

<p>I saw many of my old friends <br/>
and aquaintances and was informed that others of <br/>
them were dead.</p>

<p>I met with many friends on the <br/>
day after my return to Nauvoo and also sat in <br/>
council with the Twelve and was happy once more <br/>
to meet with my quorum. I moved my things <br/>
to Elder Kimball's. My wife and child were sick, </p>",
42828.0,386,,"<p>in the case.</p>

<p>Several letters were read touching the<br/>
subject and then Elder [[Benjamin Winchester|Winchester]] made a lengthy<br/>
speech trying to justify himself.</p>

<p>President [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] followed and plead<br/>
in behalf of mercy</p>

<p>Elder [[George Washington Joshua Adams|George J Adams]] gave<br/>
his testimony against Winchester who afterwards<br/>
followed him and both spoke several times.</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Prophet arose and<br/>
rebuked Elder Winchester in the sharpest manner<br/>
and said he had a lying spirit</p>

<p>After hearing the testimony in the<br/>
case [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] President of the Twelve said he<br/>
had made up his mind and his decision was<br/>
that Elder Winchester should give up his license<br/>
and cease preaching until he should reform</p>

<p>President Hyrum Smith said<br/>
he should not like to have such a decision given<br/>
without another trial to give Elder Winchester a<br/>
chance to get more testimony if he could.</p>

<p>President Young said he should<br/>
then prefer the case turned over to the High Council</p>

<p>Joseph said it was not the business<br/>
of the High Council but belonged to the Twelve and<br/>
they alone for it concerned matters abroad and<br/>
not in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. The High Council's business<br/>
was to try cases belonging to the city and that of<br/>
the Twelve to regulate the churches and Elders abroad<br/>
in all the world and Elder Winchester came under<br/>
that jurisdiction</p>

<p>Hyrum urged the case to be put off<br/>
until the next day.</p>

<p>Joseph said the case might be<br/>
put of until the next morning if it would do<br/>
anybody any good.</p>

<p>Then President Brigham Young<br/>
arose and spoke in the majesty of his calling</p>",
42828.0,293,,"<p>ready to set sail for home early in April.</p>

<p>The day after brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber]] returned from<br/>
[[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] a second time and we held a prayer meeting in the <br/>
evening but he was unable to be present at our next preaching<br/>
meeting from indisposition.</p>

<p>During this week we both took the last<br/>
sittings for our portrait and with Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland]] visited<br/>
the largest docks in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]].</p>

<p>First we visited St. Catherine's Dock<br/>
and after viewing the shipping and freight of every description<br/>
we next went to the London Dock</p>

<p>Among many other things we saw the<br/>
Eastern Wine Vault. This is much the largest vault<br/>
in the world. It is altogether underground and covers<br/>
nine English acres.</p>

<p>The whole vault is supported with<br/>
tremendous arches and pillars and laid off in the form<br/>
of streets. It had been built 33 years.</p>

<p>We walked through the length and<br/>
breadth of the vault with a guide each one carrying a<br/>
lighted lamp in his hand. Over our heads were the<br/>
street and city.</p>

<p>This vault alone contains thirty thousand<br/>
Pipes of the best Port Wine and six thousand Pipes of Sherry<br/>
and ^the lower^ three minor vaults of great extension filled with<br/>
the same article; besides many thousand Pipes of wine<br/>
<strike>and</strike> Brandy Gin and other liquors were strewed through<br/>
all the docks warfs and storehouses. We had a tasting<br/>
order and found the wine of the rarest quality. But it <br/>
was pitiful to think of the vast sums of money<br/>
spent in intoxicating liquors while thousands were<br/>
nearly starving for bread in the streets.</p>

<p>Leaving this scene we called into<br/>
a Jewish Synagogue and stayed during worship<br/>
and then returned to our room.</p>

<p>I called for Mr [[Brother Hender|Hender]] and he<br/>
came home with me and soon the Rev. [[James Albon|James <br/>
Albon]] also came and we all went to the bath in</p>",
42828.0,339,,"<p>I was quite unsettled where to turn or which <br/>
way to settle myself. Some of my quorum thought it <br/>
best for me to got to [[Warsaw, Hancock County, Illinois|Warsaw]] with Elder [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] but after <br/>
meeting in Conference with the Twelve it was voted that I <br/>
should locate myself in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>The temporal business of the Church was <br/>
laid upon the quorum of the Twelve.</p>

<p>On the 30th of October the City Council met <br/>
[FIGURE] &amp; among its business I was appointed one of the City Council of <br/>
Nauvoo.</p>

<p>^Commence here^</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday and I met with <br/>
the Twelve and the Presidency at the office of [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum<br/>
Smith]] and spent most of the day in Council</p>

<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] severely reproved [[Benjamin Winchester|Benjamin <br/>
Winchester]] for getting out of his place, after which he <br/>
taught us principle for several hours. He spoke upon <br/>
the gathering of the nations for the building up of the Kingdom <br/>
of God &amp;c.</p>

<p>Six days afterwards I attended the <br/>
City Council for the first time and was sworn into my <br/>
office as Councillor</p>

<p>On the seventh which was also Sunday <br/>
I for the first time since my return with some of the <br/>
Twelve called upon brother Joseph thence to brother <br/>
Brigham Young's and then to the meeting.</p>

<p>Here I found many hundreds of <br/>
the Elders and members of the Church gathered and Elder <br/>
[[William Oglesby Clark|William Clark]] preached for about two hours</p>

<p>When he had closed brother Joseph <br/>
arose and reproved him as pharisceeical and hypocritical <br/>
and ^said^ that he had not edified the people</p>

<p>The Prophet then delivered unto us <br/>
and edifying address showing us what temperance faith <br/>
virtue charity and truth were. He also said if we <br/>
did not accuse one another God would not accuse us <br/>
If we had no accuser we should enter into the Kingdom <br/>
of heaven. He would take us there and if we would <br/>
not accuse him he would not accuse us. He said </p>",
42828.0,387,,"<p>and among other remarks [[Brigham Young|he]] said that his mind was made<br/>
up and that <strike>neither</strike> the remarks of brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] <strike>nor of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]</strike><br/>
had altered it. As for himself he would not sit upon the<br/>
case another day. He considered it an insult upon his<br/>
office and calling as an Apostle of Jesus Christ and he<br/>
would not bear it. As for the rest of the Twelve they<br/>
might do as they pleased; for himself he would not do<br/>
so. [[Benjamin Winchester|Benjamin Winchester]] had despised and rejected the<br/>
counsel of the Presidency and the Twelve and had said<br/>
they had no jurisdiction over him in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] <br/>
and power to say where he should go &amp;c. But he and<br/>
others will find that there is power in the Twelve.<br/>
We know from whom we have received our power<br/>
and who are our benefactors and we are thankful<br/>
for it. Benjamin Winchester has never for the<br/>
first time received our counsel but has gone contrary<br/>
to it. No one is safe in his hands. He calls <br/>
Hyrum an old granny and slanders everybody.<br/>
He says there is contradiction between Hyrum and<br/>
the Twelve. There is no contradiction between<br/>
us and Hyrum, is there brother Hyrum. (He <br/>
answered, ""No."")</p>

<p>After Brigham closed Joseph said<br/>
he would give us a little counsel if we saw fit to<br/>
take it. He thought it proper for us to silence<br/>
Elder Winchester take his license and have him<br/>
come to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with his family and if he would<br/>
not do so then let him go out of the Church</p>

<p>A vote was then taken to that effect.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph addressed the Twelve and said<br/>
""In all your councils and especially on trial you should<br/>
observe all pertaining to the subject and discern the<br/>
spirit by which either party is governed. We should<br/>
be in a situation to understand every spirit and<br/>
judge righteous judgement and should not let the council<br/>
be imposed upon by an unruly conduct</p>

<p>""The Saints need not think because<br/>
I am familiar with them and am playful and cheerful</p>",
42828.0,294,,"<p>in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]] and I baptized the Rev. Mr [[James Albon|Albon]]<br/>
and [[Brother Hender|Mr Hender]]</p>

<p>Next day we held a prayer meeting<br/>
with the Saints and in the afternoon confirmed one<br/>
and blessed one child. We took tea with brother Albon<br/>
and met a full congregation in the evening</p>

<p>The Opening of Parliament<br/>
Jan 26 1841.</p>

<p>This was a great day in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] and as Travellers<br/>
from another nation as well as missionaries of the <br/>
Gospel we did not lose the opportunity of witnessing<br/>
the opening of the British Parliament.</p>

<p>I started in company with<br/>
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland]] and several others for<br/>
[[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St James Park]] where we arrived at 10 o'clock and<br/>
found the citizens of London massing by tens of<br/>
thousands for the purpose of having a view of her<br/>
[[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Majesty]] as she passed through the Park to the<br/>
House of Lords to open Parliament</p>

<p>Long before two o'clock the whole<br/>
line from [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]] through St. James'<br/>
Park along Whitehall and Parliament Street leading<br/>
to the House of Lords was one continuous mass of<br/>
the inhabitants of London. The windows of the<br/>
houses all along <strike>was</strike> ^were^ crowded with fashionable dressed<br/>
ladies, in white on Richmond Terrace, and on the steps<br/>
at the base of the Duke of York's monument were<br/>
immense bodies of people.</p>

<p>It was judged that there<br/>
<strike>was</strike> ^were^ from three to four hundred thousand gathered<br/>
on this occassion but notwithstanding this immense<br/>
body of people we had the good fortune through<br/>
the favour of one of the Queen's Life Guards<br/>
to get a place in the front line.</p>

<p>Her Majesty started a quarter<br/>
before 2 o'clock. The cortege consisted of five</p>",
42828.0,340,,"<p>what many persons called sin was not sin and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|he]] did <br/>
many things to break down superstition.</p>

<p>After the close I met with the Twelve <br/>
and High Priest quorum. The ''Word of Wisdom"" <br/>
having been brought up Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] <br/>
said, ""Shall I break the ""Word of Wisdom if I go home <br/>
and drink a cup of tea?"" No; Wisdom is justified <br/>
of her children."" The subject was discussed in <br/>
an interesting manner and the conclusion reached <br/>
that we should deal with such matters in wisdom <br/>
and that forced abstinence was not making us <br/>
free, but putting a yoke upon our necks</p>

<p>Baptisimal Font Dedicated</p>

<p>The <br/>
First Baptisms for the Dead.</p>

<p>Two weeks afterwards which was Sunday the <br/>
21st of November after meeting in council <br/>
with the Twelve at brother Brigham Young's <br/>
I met with the General Assembly near the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] <br/>
and heard a discourse by Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] followed by <br/>
President [[Hyrum Smith|Hyram Smith]].</p>

<p>Afterwards the Twelve met at <br/>
President Young's until 4 o'clock when we repaired <br/>
to the Baptisimal Font in the Temple for the <br/>
purpose of baptizing for the dead for the remission <br/>
of sins and for the healing of the sick</p>

<p>It was truly an interesting scene <br/>
It was the</p>

<p>First Font</p>

<p>built in this last dispensation for the glorious <br/>
provision of the Gospel for the salvation of both <br/>
the living and the dead</p>

<p>It was dedicated by President <br/>
Joseph Smith and the Twelve and this was the first</p>",
42828.0,388,,"<p>that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] am ignorant of what is going on. Iniquity of any<br/>
kind cannot be retained in the Church, <strike>of any kind</strike>, and<br/>
it will not fare well where I am for I am determined<br/>
that while I do lead the Church to lead them right""</p>

<p>Joseph farther ^said^ as concerning Elder [[George Washington Joshua Adams|Adams]]<br/>
that he had given satisfaction to him confessed<br/>
wherein he had done wrong and had asked for<br/>
mercy intending to take a right course and begin<br/>
a new in the church.</p>

<p>After much instruction from Joseph <br/>
the council adjourned.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
met in Council at President Joseph Smith's [[Red Brick Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|store]] to make<br/>
some arrangements to start on their mission to collect<br/>
funds for the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]]. We each of<br/>
us was bound made, a bond of two thousand dollars<br/>
for the faithful performance of our duty in making<br/>
strict returns to the Trustee in Trust of all property<br/>
put into our hands. Elder [[Aaron Johnson|Aaron Johnson]] was<br/>
my bondsman</p>

<p>President Joseph Smith gave me<br/>
the following</p>

<p><u>Letter</u> <u>of</u> <u>Commendation</u><br/>
<u>given</u><br/>
<u>To</u> <u>Elder</u> <u>Willford</u> <u>Woodruff</u></p>

<p>""<u>To</u> <u>all Saints</u> <u>and</u> <u>Honourable</u> <u>Men of the</u> <u>earth Greeting:</u></p>

<p>""Dear Brethren and Friends,</p>

<p>I Joseph Smith a Servant of<br/>
the Lord and Trustee in Trust for the Church<br/>
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints do hereby<br/>
certify that the bearer hereof Willford Woodruff<br/>
an<strike>d</strike> Elder and one of the Twelve Apostles of </p>",
42828.0,295,,"<p>carriages containing the attendants of Royalty and the State<br/>
carriage in which were her [[Victoria of the United Kingdom, b. 1819|Majesty]] and [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, b. 1819|Prince Albert]]<br/>
who sat on her right.</p>

<p>The Queen's Body Guard ^formed^ by the Royal Blues<br/>
the Life Guards did duty on the line. The State carriage<br/>
was drawn by eight of the cream coloured Hanoverian<br/>
horses which we had seen at the Royal Mews.</p>

<p>The whole train passed within ten<br/>
feet of us so that we had a fair view of the Queen and<br/>
Prince Albert both going and returning from the House<br/>
of Lords. Her Majesty was of small stature and<br/>
plain in features and her dress was a plain white<br/>
satin trimed with white lace and she wore a necklace<br/>
of brillants. Prince Albert was quite a handsome man<br/>
They continually bowed to the people as they passed along<br/>
On her return to the Palace she appeared much fatigued.</p>

<p>It was the grandest earthly sight<br/>
I ever saw.</p>

<p>Before the close of the month I <br/>
baptized three more into the church and on the <br/>
2nd of Feb. we went to [[Stationers|Stationers Hall]] near [[St. Paul|Saint<br/>
Paul's]] where Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] made enquiries concerning<br/>
the securing of the copyright of the Book of Mormon<br/>
and on our way we saw a large fire in Finsbury Square<br/>
but it was partly extinguished.</p>

<p>The following evening we held<br/>
a meeting and had a good time and appointed a<br/>
committee to hire a preaching room. They were Dr<br/>
[[William Copeland|Copeland]] Rev [[James Albon|James Albon]] and Priest [[John Cooper|John Cooper]].<br/>
Brother ^Albon^ wished to make Elder Kimball and myself<br/>
a gilt frame each for our portraits which we accepted.</p>

<p>I received a letter from Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kington]]<br/>
informing me that he had commenced building up a<br/>
Church in the city of [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]]. He had baptized five<br/>
and organized a Branch of nine members</p>

<p>On the 4th we took the rail to<br/>
[[Greenwich, Kent, England|Greenwich]] which stands upon the banks of the</p>",
42828.0,341,,"<p>time the font had been prepared for the reception of candidates <br/>
on the Sabath</p>

<p>A large congregation assembled and Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham <br/>
Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] went forward <br/>
and baptized about forty persons and Elders [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] <br/>
[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and myself assisted in confirming them <br/>
Afterwards I spent the evening with the quorum of the Twelve <br/>
at brother Heber C. Kimballs.</p>

<p>On the 24 of this month I took charge <br/>
of the [[Nauvoo Provision Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Provision Store]] for the Committee of the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]]</p>

<p>The next day about 200 Saints landed at <br/>

I sympathized with them under the hard circumstances of <br/>
their arrival</p>

<p>The following Sunday was spent <br/>
at Brigham Young's with the Twelve and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] conversing<br/>
upon a variety of subjects. It was an interesting day <br/>
Elder [[Joseph Fielding|Joseph Fielding]] was present having been four years <br/>
on mission to England. We also saw a number of the <br/>
English brethren.</p>

<p>Joseph the Prophet said that</p>

<p>The Book of Mormon was the most Correct as <br/>
the word of God of any Book on Earth and that a man <br/>
would get nearer to God by abiding in its precepts than <br/>
by that of any other book. He said it is the key <br/>
stone of our religion.</p>

<p>Next Sunday with my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and <br/>
sister [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimball]] I spent a part of the day at brother <br/>
[[Richard Rushton|Rushtons]] with a number of the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Pottery]] Saints from <br/>
[[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]].</p>

<p>Indeed I was now in the midst of <br/>
hundreds whom I had baptized in America the Islands <br/>
of the Sea and in England and [[Wales|Wales]] who had now gathered <br/>
to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and I was occassionally receiving and <br/>
paying them visits. Among these were Elders [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] <br/>
[[John Benbow|Benbow]] [[Edward Ockey|Ockey]] [[Daniel Browett|Brewett]] [[William Hill Pitt|Pitt]] and a number of <br/>
others whose names are familiar in my history</p>",

city on the 6th day of April 1843.</p>

<p>He therefore is recommend to all Saints and<br/>
honourable people as a legal agent to collect ^funds^ for the purpose<br/>
of building the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] and [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] of the Lord.</p>

<p>Confident that he will honour this high<br/>
trust as well as ardently fulfill his commission as a<br/>
Messenger of Peace and Salvation as one of the Lord's<br/>
noble men I can fervently say, May the Lord clear<br/>
his way before him and bless him and bless those that<br/>
obey his teachings wherever there are ears to hear and<br/>
hearts to feel.</p>

<p>He is in the language of the Hebrews<br/>
""The friend of [[Israel|Israel]]"" and worthy to be received and<br/>
entertained as a man of God. Yea he has (as<br/>
had the ancient Apostle) the Good Word that leadeth<br/>
unto Eternal Life.</p>

<p>Wherefore brethren and friends while<br/>
you hear the assurance of the integrity fidelity and ability<br/>
of this servant of the Living God trusting that your hearts<br/>
and energies will be enlivened and deeply engaged in the<br/>
building of these houses directed by revelation for the<br/>
salvation of all Saints and that you will not rest where<br/>
you are until all things are prepared before you and<br/>
you are gathered home with the rest of Israel to meet<br/>
your God, I feel strong in the belief and have a growing<br/>
expectation that you will not withhold any means in <br/>
your power that can be used to accomplish this glorious<br/>
work.</p>

<p>Finally as one that greatly desires<br/>
the salvation of man let me remind you all to<br/>
strive with a Godly zeal for virtue holiness and the<br/>
commandments of the Lord. Be wise be just be<br/>
liberal and above all be charitable, always abounding<br/>

Americans take their longitude.</p>

<p>We walked from [[Greenwich, Kent, England|Greenwhich]]<br/>
to [[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] also upon the banks of the Thames and<br/>
the most important naval and military post in [[England|England]]</p>

<p>There was at this time a small<br/>
church at Woolwhich numbering six members which<br/>
had been raised up by Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]. That evening<br/>
we met five of them at brother [[Richard Bates|Bates]] and we<br/>
found the Woolwhich Saints through few firm<br/>
in the faith</p>

<p>It was very cold the next day<br/>
and I spent the morning of the fire side of brother<br/>
Bates reading the Life and Death of the Reverend<br/>
[[John Fletcher|John Fletcher]] but in the afternoon we took a view<br/>
of the town and its places of note and in spite of<br/>
the cold we had a most interesting time.</p>

<p>First we visited the [[Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich, Kent, England|Artillary]]<br/>
and [[Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich, Kent, England|Marine Barracks]] passed through and<br/>
had a view of their Drill and Parade ground</p>

<p>As cold as it was there were<br/>
a number of companies on parade and new recruits<br/>
under drill and one horse company exers<strike>s</strike>ising. There<br/>
were many hundreds of cannon which we saw<br/>
and inspected one measuring 16 feet in length 3 1/2 in<br/>
diameter at the britch and 2 at the mouth</p>

<p>There were two soldiers being<br/>
burried at the time and with the usual military<br/>
display. We were present and saw them lowered<br/>
into the grave side by side. Then the chaplain read<br/>
the burial service and a company of soldiers fired<br/>
three rounds over their graves and retired. All<br/>
tended to make the view before us picturesque<br/>
though the latter scene gave a melancholy shade</p>

<p>We next visited the Dock and<br/>
Prison yard. This is the largest and most interesting<br/>
Dock yard in the world.</p>",
42828.0,342,,"<p>In the evening we walked to Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] and <br/>
spent several hours with him and Sister [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma]] and <br/>
had a very pleasant visit</p>

<p>Joseph had commenced this day <br/>
to proofread the Book of Mormon that it might <br/>
be sterotyped. He had read 60 pages. He <br/>
rehearsed over to us the [[Missouri|Missouri]] transactions and <br/>
spoke of the death of [[David Wyman Patten|David Patten]] and the request <br/>
which he made of him in his last dying <br/>
moments.</p>

<p>Two weeks later in the evening of <br/>
Sunday I met with the Twelve at Joseph's the Seer<strike>s</strike> <br/>
and heard a discourse delivered by [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] <br/>
He spake of the parable of Jeremiah concerning <br/>
the Potter and the clay. He said that when it was <br/>
marred in the hands of the potter, it had to be thrown <br/>
asside to go into the next batch and was accounted <br/>
as a vessel of dishonour but that which formed well <br/>
and was pliable in the hands of the Potter became a <br/>
vessel of honour. So also he said it was with the <br/>
human ^family^ and their Creator. Joseph said that brother <br/>
Kimball had given the true explanation of the parable</p>

<p>After [[Sidney Roberts|Sidney Roberts]] had further <br/>
occupied the meeting for a season Joseph the Seer <br/>
arose and read from the New Testament the parable <br/>
of the ""Vine"" and its ""Branches"" and explained it much <br/>
to our edification</p>

<p>The Prophet observed during his remarks <br/>
that some said he was a fallen prophet because he <br/>
did not bring forth more of the word of the Lord <br/>
Why does he not do it? was their cry. We are able <br/>
to receive it!"" But he said unto us—""No not one <br/>
in this room is prepared</p>

<p>In revelation he remarked ""that a man <br/>
might command his son to do a thing and before he had <br/>
done it and with sufficient reason <strike>before he had done it</strike><br/>

right. But if the Lord gives a command and afterwards</p>",

<p>City of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
June 1st 1843</p>

<p>On the 11th a large Assembly of Saints met at<br/>
the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and were addressed by the Prophet.<br/>
His subject was upon</p>

<p><u>The</u> <u>Gathering</u> — <u>Baptism</u> <u>for the</u> <u>Dead</u> — The <u>Spirits</u><br/>
<u>in</u> <u>prison</u> <u>the</u> <u>Different</u> <u>Glories</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>Godhead</u></p>

<p>He took for the foundation of his discourse the<br/>
words of Jesus to the Jews—""How oft would I<br/>
have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her<br/>
chicken under her wings but ye would not""</p>

<p>From his discourse I called some of<br/>
the points and noted them in my journal. He<br/>
asked—</p>

<p>""What was the object of gathering the<br/>
Jews or the people of God together in any age<br/>
of the world? The main object was to build<br/>
unto the Lord an House whereby he could reveal <br/>
unto His people the ordinances and glories of his<br/>
Kingdom and teach them the ways of salvation; for<br/>
there are certain ordinances and principles which<br/>
when they are taught and practised must be<br/>
done in a House or Temple built for that purpose</p>

<p>This was ordained in the mind of<br/>
God before the world was and it was for this purpose<br/>
that He designed oft to gather together the Jews but<br/>
they would not.</p>

<p>It is for the same reason that<br/>
God gathers together the people in the last days</p>",
42828.0,297,,"<p>On passing through the gate into the yard we recorded<br/>
our names and residences on a book and was then conducted<br/>
by Mr [[John Finsbury|John Finsbury]] policeman to all parts of the yard<br/>
and saw all the branches of business carried on by government<br/>
there.</p>

<p>There are employed in this yard hundreds<br/>
of hands besides seven hundred prisoners. These were<br/>
engaged in building vessels steem boats ships of war making<br/>
anchors cables chains boilers cannon shot ^&amp;c^ The fires or<br/>
bellows were all worked by steem and the operation of the<br/>
engines were pointed out to us.</p>

<p>Among many other curiousities we saw<br/>
the Hydrolic Press by which the strength of all the anchors<br/>
and cables are tested. With this small Press they can<br/>
readily break 150 tons weight and can snap an anchor<br/>
of five tons into pieces like a pipe stem</p>

<p>There were specimens of timber<br/>
which had been buried in the earth to see which<br/>
would stand the longest and it was found that the<br/>
English Oak stood the longest</p>

<p>We saw the boat in which Captian<br/>
Ross and his comrads were saved. Then we went<br/>
on to the upper deck of the new 120 gun ship Trafalgar<br/>
It had been upon the stocks a number of years but<br/>
was to be launched the following May. It was<br/>
considered as large as any ship then on the sea. He<br/>
also saw the convict ship</p>

<p>We left the Dock yard and went<br/>
to Bro [[A. Painter|Painter's]] house and had refreshments and then<br/>
we took the steam boat for [[London, Middlesex, England|London]].</p>

<p>A letter from sister [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] to Elder<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] informed us that the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]<br/>
was going to write for the Twelve to hold a Conference<br/>
in [[England|England]] in the Spring ordain as many as they<br/>
deemed wisdom and to ^send^ them to all parts where they<br/>
could and then for the Twelve to return to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>In the weekly Despatch we read of the<br/>
wreck of the Packet Ship Garrick in which Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and</p>",
42828.0,343,,"<p>revokes it and commands something else then the Prophet is <br/>
considered a fallen Prophet""</p>

<p>""Because the Church will not receive chastisment <br/>
from the hand of the Prophet and Apostles the Lord chastises <br/>
us with sickness and death.""</p>

<p>""Let not any man publish his own righteousness <br/>
Others can do that for him. Rather let him confess his sins <br/>
and then he will be forgiven and bring forth more fruit.""</p>

<p>""The reason why we do not have more of the <br/>
secrets of the Lord revealled unto us is because we do not keep even <br/>
our own secrets but reveal them and make our difficulties known <br/>
even to our enemies""</p>

<p>""What greater love hath any man than that <br/>
he lay down his life for his friends. Then why not stand <br/>
by them unto death""</p>

<p>""These and many other matters [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
spoke and enlarged upon to our great edification</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] arose and said that <br/>
one thing rested with weight upon his mind—namely that we <br/>
ought to be prepared to keep each commandment as it came <br/>
from the mouth of the Prophet and as the Lord had commanded <br/>
us to build a Temple we should do it speedily</p>

<p><u>Christmas</u> <u>Day</u></p>

<p>On Christmas day the Twelve took supper by invitation <br/>
at M<sup>r</sup> [[Hiram Kimball|Hyrum Kimball]]s. It was excellent sleighing <br/>
and I got horses and sleigh and carried the wives of the <br/>
Twelve to our host's and home again after our party broke <br/>
up.</p>

<p>Our company consisted of Brigham <br/>
Young [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] <br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and myself and and our wives except Sister <br/>
[[Jennetta Richards Richards|Richards]] who was attending Sister [[Marinda Nancy Johnson Hyde|Hyde]]</p>

<p>We had an excellent feast and before we <br/>
left M<sup>r</sup> Kimball made each one of the Twelve a present<br/>
of a Lot of land and made out a bond for a deed to the whole <br/>
of the quorum. Each lot was worth 50 dollars making</p>",
42828.0,391,,"<p>to build unto Him an House to prepair them <strike>with</strike> ^for the^ ordinances<br/>
endowments washings anointings &amp;c</p>

<p>One of the ordinances of the House of<br/>
the Lord is baptism for the dead. God decreed<br/>
before the foundation of the world that this ordinance<br/>
should be administered in an House prepared for that<br/>
purpose.</p>

<p>If a man obtains the fulness of the Gospel<br/>
he must get it in the same day that Jesus obtained it and<br/>
that was by keeping all the ordinances of the House of<br/>
the Lord.</p>

<p>Men will say I will never foresake you<br/>
but will stand by you at all times yet the moment you<br/>
teach them some of the mysteries of God that are retained<br/>
in the heavens and are to be revealed to the children of<br/>
men when they are prepared that moment they will be the<br/>
first to stone you and put you to death. It was upon<br/>
the same principle and the same spirit which crucified<br/>
the Lord Jesus Christ""</p>

<p>I will say something about the Spirits<br/>
in Prison. there has been much said upon the words<br/>
of Jesus to the ""Thief on the Cross"" saying ""This day thou<br/>
shalt be with me in Paradise.</p>

<p>The Comentators and Translators make<br/>
Jesus to say Paradise. But what is Par[adise]? It is<br/>
a modern word and does not answer at all to the original<br/>
which Jesus used. There is nothing in the original of any<br/>
language signifying Paradise. But it was ""This day I will<br/>
be with thee in the world of Spirits"" and will teach thee or<br/>
answer thy inquiries. The ""Theif on the Cross"" was to be<br/>
with Jesus Christ  in the world of Spirits. He did not say<br/>
Paradise or heaven.</p>

<p>The ^Refer^ doctrine of Baptism for the Dead<br/>
is clearly shown in the New Testament and if the doctrine<br/>
is not good then throw away the New Testament but if it<br/>
is the Word of God then let the doctrine be acknowledged<br/>
of God.</p>

<p>It was one of the reasons why Jesus said to the</p>",
42828.0,298,,"<p>[[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] crossed the Atlantic twice.</p>

<p>On the 7th we baptized Mrs [[Susanna Mehitable Rogers Sangiovanni Keate|Susanna<br/>
M. Sangiovanni]] at which I took great satisfaction<br/>
for she was the daughter of [[David White Rogers|David W. Rogers]] of<br/>
[[Montrose, Angus, Scotland|Montrose]]. She was married to an Italian who<br/>
was a very jealous man and an unbeleiver in the<br/>
Bible or any of the word of God and he would not<br/>
grant her any religious privileges. But this morning<br/>
she had come to be baptized and returned home rejoicing<br/>
with her whole heart. There was also one baptized<br/>
the day before.</p>

<p>This was Sunday and in the<br/>
afternoon we communed with the Saints experienced<br/>
a profitable time and had a full house and in<br/>
the evening Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] preached to a full<br/>
congregation and I followed him. The people paid<br/>
good attention and the Lord was with us greatly.</p>

<p>The Book of Mormon<br/>
Entered<br/>
At Stationers Hall.</p>

<p>We received on the 8th a package of 20 Books<br/>
of Mormon and two dozen Hymn Books and<br/>
Heber C Kimball and myself went to <strike>the</strike> [[Stationers|Stationers<br/>
Hall]] and secured the copyright of the Book of<br/>
Mormon in the name [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith Ju<sup>r</sup>]]. We <br/>
left five copies of the book and paid three shillings</p>

<p>In the evening we baptized<br/>
four persons one of whom was the [[Mary Ann Eacock Albon|wife]] of the Rev.<br/>
[[James Albon|James Albon]] who had already received the Gospel</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] per letter<br/>
informed us of the large imigration of that season<br/>
There were to go on one ship 235 and on another 100.</p>

<p>To the reader aquainted with the<br/>
immense emigrations of the Saints in later years<br/>
our consideration of the sailing of three or four<br/>
hundred as a large emigration will <strike>perchance at</strike><br/>
^be noteworth.^</p>",
42828.0,344,,"<p>for the whole six hundred dollars. My Lot was <br/>
No 4 Block 10 in [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimballs]] addition to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Next day [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] called upon me and <br/>
others of the Twelve to attend meeting at his house in <br/>
the evening. Many good principles were presented by <br/>
Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] such as ""Speak not in tongues <br/>
to your own nation but to those of another nation <br/>
and then it would condem the unbeleiver; for the Lord <br/>
does not work in vain. Joseph spoke much on <br/>
the 14. ch of 1 Cor. upon prophesies ceasing.</p>

<p>The following day the Twelve spent <br/>
with Joseph the Seer and he unfolded to them many <br/>
glorious things at the Kingdom of God the privileges <br/>
and blessings of the Pristhood &amp;c. I had the <br/>
privilege for the first time of</p>

<p><u>Seeing the Urum Thummim</u></p>

<p>I spent the week as usual in my daily labours and <br/>
thus closed the year by my recording on the last <br/>
day in my Journal a synopsis of my travels &amp; <br/>
labours in the ministry during 1841</p>

of <br/>

that they might have attended to the ordinance of Baptism<br/>
for the Dead as well as other ordinances and for the<br/>
Priesthood and Revelations of God, &amp;c. This was the case<br/>
on the Day of Pentecost. The blessings were poured out<br/>
upon the disciples on that occasion</p>

<p>There has also been much said about<br/>
the word Hell and the sectarian world have preached<br/>
much about it. But what is hell? It is another<br/>
modern term and is taken from Hades, the Greek, or<br/>
Shaole, the Hebrew; and its true signification is a <br/>
world of spirits. Hades Shaole Paradise Spirits<br/>
in Prison is all one. It is a world of Spirits<br/>
<u>The</u> <u>Righteous</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>Wicked</u> <u>all</u> <u>go</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u><br/>
world <u>of </u><u>Spirits</u></p>

<p>Says one I beleive in one Hell and one Heaven<br/>
All are equally miserable or equally happy. But St<br/>
[[Paul (NT)|Paul]] informs us of three glories and three heavens<br/>
He knew a man caught up to the third heavens and<br/>
Jesus said there were many mansions in his Father's<br/>
Kingdom.</p>

<p>Any man might beleive that Jesus<br/>
Christ is Godd and be happy in the beleif and yet not<br/>
obey his commandments.</p>

<p>A man of God should be endowed with<br/>
all wisdom knowledge and understanding in order to<br/>
teach and lead the people. The blind may lead the<br/>
blind and both fall into the ditch together.</p>

<p>There is much said concerning God<br/>
the Godhead &amp;c. The Scriptures say there are Gods<br/>
many and Lords many. The teachers of the day<br/>
say that the Father is God the Son is God and<br/>
the Holy Ghost is God and that they are all in one<br/>
person and are one God.</p>

<p>Jesus prayed that those whom the<br/>
Father had given him out of the world might be<br/>
""<u>one</u> <u>in</u> <u>us</u> <u>as</u> <u>we</u> <u>are</u> <u>one</u>""; but if they were to</p>",
42828.0,299,,"<p>the first sight seem a small notion. But this was in <br/>
the early rise of the European Mission and moreover in 1840 the<br/>
doctrine of emigration from father land among the English<br/>
was repugnant. Emigration had not then as now become an<br/>
institution of modern times. Out of this Church it was<br/>
considered among the peasantry and manifacturing classes<br/>
of [[England|England]] as a calamity and was never accepted by them<br/>
from choice. Not until misfortune panics in trade<br/>
or dire necessity came did they accept emigration from<br/>
father-land</p>

<p>At this time then came the Latter<br/>
day Saint Apostles and elders preaching to country<br/>
loving Englishman the doctrine of emigration from their<br/>
native land — and preaching the doctrine chiefly to those<br/>
who mostly perhaps had not seen a score of miles of the<br/>
great world outside their village, homes. Well might<br/>
we then in 1840 consider the emigration of four<br/>
hundred Saints as a large matter.</p>

<p>Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself at this time<br/>
prepared a tract for the press to present to the citizens<br/>
of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] before we left the first principles of the<br/>
Gospel and commission given by Jesus to his ancient<br/>
Apostles.</p>

<p>Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] arrived<br/>
in London on the 11th to take charge of the church<br/>
after our departure. I was truly glad to once more<br/>
greet him for I had not seen him since 1837</p>

<p>On the same day Elder [[William Hill Pitt|W<sup>m</sup> Pitt]]<br/>
also arrived at our lodgings and we had an interesting<br/>
meeting in the evening. Brother Snow preached<br/>
and Elder Kimball and myself followed him and<br/>
the next ^day^ brothers Heber and Lorenzo went to<br/>
[[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] to give impetous to the work of God<br/>
in that important town.</p>

I were to testify that the world was wrong on this point<br/>
it would be true. Peter says that Jesus sat on the right<br/>

opened knows that there are <u>three</u> <u>personages</u> in the Heavens<br/>

stop Sirs. The Revelator says, ""the testimony of Jesus<br/>
is the Spirit of prophecy,"" So by your own mouth you<br/>
are condemned.</p>

<p>But to the text. Why gather the people<br/>
together in this place? For the same reason that Jesus<br/>
wanted to gather the Jews to receive the ordinances the<br/>
blessings and the glories that God has in store for his<br/>
Saints.</p>

<p>And I will <strike>now</strike> ^here^ ask this Assembly and<br/>
all the Saints if they will <strike>now</strike> build this house and<br/>
receive the ordinances and blessings which God has in<br/>
store for you or will you not build unto the Lord<br/>
this House and let Him pass by and bestow these<br/>
blessings upon another. I pause for a reply.</p>

<p>About this time in company with several others<br/>
I started to fence and plant a five acre lot of prairie<br/>
We had not got far before the reach of our wagon<br/>
broke and we were all thrown into a pile together<br/>
and the wheel went on my arm and bruised it<br/>
considerably. But we mended up and continued</p>",
42828.0,300,,"<p>in [[Lockport, Niagara County, New York|Lockport]] Jail by the State of [[New York|New York]] which was<br/>
trying him for arson and murder, and the Americans<br/>
were determined to execute him if found guilty.</p>

<p>The accusation was the burning of<br/>
the Caroline on [[Lake Erie, United States|Lake Erie]] in 1834 during the troubles<br/>
in [[Canada|Canada]]. [[England|England]] considered it a national and<br/>
not an individual affair and that [[Alexander McLeod|M. C. Cleod]] acted<br/>
by order of the British Government and not upon his<br/>
own responsibility. Under these considerations<br/>
Parliament was determined to demand his release <br/>
and defend his life even at the expence of immediate<br/>
war with America. Government had sent a <br/>
special message and instructions to the British<br/>
ambassador at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]. These threatenings<br/>
of war between [[England|England]] and America made <br/>
us anxious concerning our return to our country<br/>
and the emigration of the Saints to the body<br/>
of the Church.</p>

<p>From what I had seen of<br/>
England of one thing I felt certain and that was<br/>
that if America hazards a war with England<br/>
she would find it to be more than a joke to<br/>
meet so strong a foe and one armed to the teeth<br/>
for war. Upon the subject I thought and<br/>
wrote in my daily journal:</p>

<p>""Should Truth speak she would<br/>
represent England at the present time as the strongest<br/>
among the nations and chief in power and main spring<br/>
of the Gentile world. She will remain her season<br/>
as an instrument in the hand of God to bring<br/>
about great events, in the restoration of the Jews and<br/>
to be a scourge to the nations America not excepted<br/>
but she will also receive the scourage and the chastening<br/>
hand of the Almighty will fall upon her in turn<br/>
But O! America, America! ^whose had is^ choice above all other<br/>
lands and ^thou^ established by omnipotant Power! thy<br/>
salt hath lost it savour thy light hath gone<br/>
out and thine Eagle's crest is stained with the blood</p>",
42828.0,346,,"<p>Jan 1842</p>

<p>Chapter XIX</p>

<p>New Year's day 1842 found me in <br/>
the city of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] with the quorum of the Twelve and <br/>
our wives spending the day at the house of brother <br/>
[[Sylvester B. Stoddard|Stodard]].</p>

<p>It was an interesting occassion for <br/>
us to meet together with our families at a festive <br/>
time in the city of the Saints in the midst of peace <br/>
and love. We could the more highly prize this privilege <br/>
as we were so often called to be seperated in the vineyard <br/>
of the Lord</p>

<p>It was now my privilege and lot to <br/>
tarry for a season at home, and to provide for my family <br/>
This was the first time since I had been in the Church <br/>
that I had been thus privileged as I had been on missions most <br/>
of the time for eight years</p>

<p>As we had now the commandment <br/>
of the Lord to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo <br/>
house]] resting upon us the probability was that the Quorum <br/>
of the Twelve would spend most of the time in Nauvoo <br/>
until the Temple was built.</p>

<p>On the 10th of the month I sold to <br/>
brother [[John Horlick|John Horlick]] the South half of my lot and bought <br/>
two lots of [[Hiram Kimball|Hyrum Kimball]] for $250 fifty of which <br/>
I paid him down in cloth and a watch and the other</p>",
42828.0,394,,"<p>to the prairie and made 82 rods of worm fence with<br/>
stakes and riders. Just before I left I went to brother<br/>
Cheney to get a drink of water and his dog bit me<br/>
very badly through the calf of my left. He was<br/>
an ugly dog and had bit several persons before<br/>
I was very lame for some days and the next time<br/>
I went to my lot I informed Brother [[Elijah Cheney|Cheney]] that<br/>
I should not be satisfied unless he killed his dog<br/>
as he was dangerous and in the habit of biting<br/>
persons.</p>

<p>Judge [[James Adams|Adams]] of [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] wrote<br/>
informing us that the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Governor]] of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
had made another demand for [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] at the <br/>
hands of the [[Thomas Ford|Governor]] of [[Illinois|Illinois]] and that Ford<br/>
of Illinois had issued the write for his apprehension.</p>

<p>Two messengers were immediately<br/>
despatched from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to President Joseph<br/>
Smith, who was absent <strike>&amp;</strike> ^about^ 200 miles from home<br/>
at the time, informing him of these facts.</p>

<p>This was on the Sunday. <strike>and</strike><br/>
The <strike>Sabath</strike> following <strike>being</strike> ^day^ June 25th in the afternoon<br/>
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] came into the Stand and requested the<br/>
Masonic Fraternity to meet him in the [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Lodge Room]]<br/>
in a half an hour. We immediately went down<br/>
but a quarter of us could not get into the room.</p>

<p><strike>This being the case</strike> We formed<br/>
a hollow square on the green. Hyrum then<br/>
informed us that the [[Thomas Reynolds|Sheriff]] of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson Co.]] Missouri<br/>
and [[Harmon Theodore Wilson|Wilson]] of [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] had come upon Joseph<br/>
and taken him by surprise presenting each of<br/>
them a pistol to his breast and swaring they<br/>
would kill him if he made any resistance.</p>

<p>Brother [[Stephen Markham|Markham]] went to his<br/>
assistance and they presented pistols to him<br/>
also and threatened his life. He approached<br/>
them however to knock down the pistols when<br/>
they again pointed them at Joseph's breast</p>",
42828.0,347,,"<p>was to be paid in two annual payments; and a week or two <br/>
afterwards I purchased a house and an acre of land of brother <br/>
[[William Parsons|Parsons]] to be paid for on the 20th of the following April</p>

<p>Several days later I rode to Brother <br/>
[[John Benbow|Benbow]]s on the Pra<strike>r</strike>^i^rie six miles from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and it being <br/>
Sunday I preached at his house</p>

<p>This was the first time that I had visited <br/>
him since my return to Nauvoo. I spent the time very <br/>
pleasantly while there. His farm looked almost like the <br/>
Garden of Eden. I never had seen more work done in one <br/>
year on a pra<strike>r</strike>^i^rie farm than on his. He had surrounded <br/>
it and crossed it with heavy ditches and planted thorn hedges <br/>
His dwelling barns sheds garden yards orchards &amp;c were all <br/>
beautifully arranged. <strike>Indeed</strike> Brother Benbow's farm much <br/>
resembled the farms of old [[England|England]] where as the reader has <br/>
learned he held the position of a respectable well-to-do-farmer,<br/>
who cultivated about 300 acres of land</p>

<p>This place was a pleasant retreat for a <br/>
Summers ride from Nauvoo. The little neighbourhood <br/>
consisted of five families from England and all well united <br/>
excepting one family who had denyed the faith.</p>

<p>Before my return to the city on the <br/>
following day I paid to brother John Benbow 200 dollars <br/>
for President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and endorsed it on his note</p>

<p>I assisted in drawing up from the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] <br/>
two large stones to the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo house]] for the threshholds <br/>
of the doors</p>

<p>A few days previous a revelation <br/>
was given for the Twelve to obtain the printing establishment <br/>
of [[Ebenezer Robinson|E. Robinson]] and govern the printing of the Times &amp; <br/>
Seasons and all the publication of the Church as directed by <br/>
the Holy Ghost</p>

<p>After consulting upon the subject the <br/>
quorum of the Twelve appointed Elders [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and <br/>
Willford Woodruff to take charge of the whole establishment <br/>
and edit the Times and Seasons under the direction <br/>
of Joesph the Seer</p>

<p>Accordingly on the 3rd of February <strike>3rd</strike> I</p>",
42828.0,395,,"<p>and said they would kill <u>him</u> [[Stephen Markham|Markham]] if approached<br/>
them. So to save [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] life Marham forbare<br/>
and they then took Joseph into [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] and started for<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]].</p>

<p>They had gone about ten miles when they<br/>
were stoped by the inhabitants of the country who<br/>
swore they should not carry Joseph Smith any farther<br/>
without giving him a chance of the law and they<br/>
took out a writ of Habeas Corpus in behalf of Joseph and<br/>
a writ against Sheriffs [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] and [[Harmon Theodore Wilson|Wilson]] and they<br/>
now wanted a company to go to Joseph to see that he<br/>
had his rights.</p>

<p>Brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] called for volunteers<br/>
and the whole city flocked together. They made choice<br/>
of such as they wished and Generals [[William Law|Law]] and<br/>
[[Charles Coulson Rich|Rich]] went with about one hundred men on horseback<br/>
and somewhere near the same on board the Maid<br/>
of Iowa. The horsemen left the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|City]] at about<br/>
8 o'clock that night but the boat did not start<br/>
until the next morning.</p>

<p><u>Triumphal Entry of the Prophet</u><br/>
<u>to</u><br/>
<u>The City of Nauvoo</u></p>

<p>Five days afterwards at 1 o'clock in the afternoon<br/>
the citizens of Nauvoo, went out in great numbers<br/>
on foot horseback and in carriages to meet the Prophet<br/>
and when they did meet him there was a scene<br/>
of great joy</p>

<p>A band of music and a great<br/>
multitude escorted him to his home and Reynolds<br/>
of Missouri and Wilson of Carthage who had taken <br/>
him by force of arms were brought to Nauvoo<br/>
with ^him^ and they looked as though they had the ague<br/>
Yet Joseph heaped coals of fire upon their heads who<br/>
had so inhumanly treated him by taking them to</p>",
42828.0,348,,"<p>left my station at the [[Nauvoo Provision Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo Provision Store]] and commenced <br/>
to labour for the Church in the Printing Establishment. Elder <br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] and myself spent the afternoon in taking an invoice <br/>
of the [[Nauvoo Printing Office, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Printing Office]] which we finished the next day and met <br/>
at [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph's]] [[Red Brick Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Store]] and [[Ebenezer Robinson|E Robinson]] made out the deed to [[Willard Richards|Willard<br/>
Richards]] of his lot and house containing the Printing establishment <br/>
and all appurtenances belonging thereto amounting in <br/>
all to $6,600.</p>

<p>The following day I assisted Willard Richards <br/>
in taking in the tithing for the ^[[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]^ amounting to about <br/>
1000 dollars worth of property</p>

<p>About two weeks later Joseph the Seer <br/>
presented us with some of the Book of Abraham written <br/>
by the hand of that Patriarch and which was found <br/>
in [[Egypt|Egypt]] and ^<strike>which</strike>^ with some mummies came into the <br/>
hands of the Prophet several years before. He was <br/>
now translating them to publish portions of it in <br/>
the Times and Seasons of which paper he was the <br/>
Editor and John Taylor his assistant while the business <br/>
part of the establishment was under my charge</p>

<p>I had been much edified of late in <br/>
hearing Joseph converse upon the mystries of the Kingdom <br/>
of God. ""Truly,"" I thought, ""the Lord is with him and <br/>
making him mighty in Knowledge and wisdom"" and I was <br/>
convinced that none of the Prophets or Seers have ever accomplished <br/>
a greater work than the Lord will bring to pass in the last <br/>
days through the instrumentality of Joseph</p>

<p>On My birthday ^March 1st^ <strike>came and</strike> I made a feast <br/>
for my friends and four days afterwards, on the 4th of <br/>
March in the morning, 30 minutes past 10 ^o'clock^ a.m. my daughter <br/>
[[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe A. Woodruff]] was born</p>

<p>A week later the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Legion met <br/>
on parade and in company with the Twelve I rode in the <br/>
Legion as assistant Chaplain. This was the first time I <br/>
had seen the Legion on parade</p>

<p>On the 15th of the ^same^ month the [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo <br/>
Masonic Lodge]] was established and organized. The <br/>
procession was found at half past one oclock at Joseph's</p>",
42828.0,396,,"<p>[[Joseph Smith Jr.|his]] house setting them at the head of his table and<br/>
causing the best his house afforded to be served to them<br/>
by his [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|wife]] — the very woman they had refused to<br/>
see her husband when they forced him with the<br/>
threatening of arms and ruffian oaths.</p>

<p>After dinner they all repaired<br/>
to the Court Room and Joseph was delivered into the<br/>
hands of the Municipal Court for trial.</p>

<p>Before he went into court Joseph<br/>
mounted a wagon and said to the multitude —</p>

<p>""I am out of the hands of the Missourians<br/>
thank God!""</p>

<p>He thanked them for their kindness and<br/>
love to him and said that he would address them at<br/>
the grove near the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] at 4 o'clock</p>

<p>After the case was introduced to the<br/>
Court Joseph informed it that he had an appointment<br/>
to address the citizens and ask^ed^ the privilege. The<br/>
court extended the courtesy to him and <strike>he went</strike> ^the^<br/>
^court^ adjourned until the next morning.</p>

<p>After the adjournment of his case<br/>
Joseph went to the Grove and took the Stand<br/>
in the presence of an assembly of about seven<br/>
thousand Saints ^to whom he narrated the incidents of<br/>
his arrest and maintained the prowers of the Charter of Nauvoo for<br/>
the protection of its citizens.^</p>

<u>of </u><u>the</u><br/>
<u>Speech of Joseph</u><br/>

<p>I require attention. I discovered what the emotions<br/>
of the people were on my arrival to this city and I<br/>
have come here to say How do you do? to all parties<br/>
and I now say How do you do at this time</p>

<p>I meet you with a heart full of</p>",
42828.0,349,,"<p>[[Red Brick Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Store]] and marched to the grove in front of the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] where the <br/>
[FIGURE] [[Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Lodge]] was organized and an address delivered by the Grand Master <br/>
of the Masonic Lodge of Illinois. There were about three thousand <br/>
assembled on the occasion [FIGURE]</p>

<p>On Sunday March the 20th a large assembly <br/>
gathered at an early hour to hear a discourse from [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] <br/>
upon the subject of baptism, but as a young child wsa dead <br/>
and his corps brougt in the assembly it called forth many <br/>
remarks upon death and the resurrection. I reported and recorded <br/>
in my Journal</p>

<p>A Brief Synopsis <br/>
of the <br/>
Sermon of Joseph the Prophet</p>

<p>The speaker read the 14 ch of Revelations and said:</p>

<p>""We have again the warning voice Sounded in our midst <br/>
""which shows the uncertainty of human life. And in my <br/>
""leasure moments I have meditated upon the subject and <br/>
asked the question, Why is it that inocent children are taken<br/>
away from us especially those who seem to be the most <br/>
intelligent beings?""</p>

<p>The Answer: [FIGURE]</p>

<p>""This world is a very wicked world and it is <br/>
a proverb that it grows weaker and wiser, but if this is the <br/>
case it is also true that the world grows more wicked and <br/>
corrupt</p>

<p>""In the early ages of the world a righteous <br/>
man—a man of God and intelligence had a better chance <br/>
to do good, to be received and beleived than at the present <br/>
day. In these days such a man is much opposed <br/>
and persecuted by most of the inhabitants of the earth <br/>
and he has much sorrow to pass through. Hence the <br/>
Lord takes many away even in infancy that they may escape <br/>
the envy of man and the sorrows and evils of the present <br/>
^and they were too true and too lovely to live on earth^ world. Therefore I rightly considered instead of mourning <br/>
we have reason to rejoice as they are delivered from the <br/>
evil and we shall soon have them again.</p>",
42828.0,397,,"<p>gratitude to Almighty God and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] presume you all feel the<br/>
same.</p>

<p>I hardly know how to express my feelings.<br/>
I feel as strong as a giant. I pulled sticks with the<br/>
men coming along and with one hand I pulled up<br/>
the strongest man there was on the road <strike>with one</strike><br/>
<strike>hand</strike> and two could not pull me up; and I continued<br/>
to pull until I pulled them to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. but I will<br/>
pass from that subject.</p>

<p>There has been great excitement in<br/>
the country but since those men took me I have<br/>
been cool and dispassionate through the whole.</p>

<p>Thank God I am now in the hands<br/>
of the Municipal Court of Nauvoo and not in the hands<br/>
of Missourians.</p>

<p>It has been discussed by the great<br/>
and wise men—lawyers and there like: Oh your<br/>
powers and legal tribunals are not to be sanctioned<br/>
and so we will make it lawful to drag away inorent<br/>
men from their families and friends and have them<br/>
unlawfully put to death by ungodly men for their<br/>
religion.</p>

<p>Relative to our charter, courts, right<br/>
of Habeaus Corpus &amp;c we have all power; and if<br/>
any man from this time fourth says anything<br/>
contrary cast it into his teeth.</p>

<p>There is a secret in this. If there<br/>
is not power in our Charter and Courts then there<br/>
is not power in the State of [[Illinois|Illinois]] nor in the<br/>
Congress nor Constitution of the United States; for<br/>
the United States gave unto Illinois her constitution<br/>
and charter; and Illionois gave unto Nauvoo <u>her</u><br/>
charter which have ceded unto us our vested<br/>
rights and she has no right nor power to take<br/>
them from us. All the power there was in<br/>
Illinois she gave to Nauvoo and any man who<br/>
says to the contrary is a fool.</p>

<p>I want you to <strike>teach</strike> ^learn^, O! Israel, what</p>",
42828.0,350,,"<p>""What chance is there for infidelity when we are <br/>
""parting from our friends daily? There is none at all. <br/>
""The infidel will grasp at every straw for help until <br/>
""death stares him in the face and then his infidelity takes <br/>
""its flight; for the realities of the eternal world are <br/>
""resting in mighty power upon him. When every earthly <br/>
""support and prop fails him he then sensibly feels the <br/>
""eternal truths of the immortality of the soul.</p>

<p>""Concerning the doctrine of baptizing or sprinkling <br/>
""children or they must welter in hell the doctrine is <br/>
""not true nor supported in Holy Writ and it is not <br/>
""consistant with the character of God""</p>

<p>""The moment children leave this world <br/>
""they are taken into Abraham's bosom. The only <br/>
difference between the old and young dying is that <br/>
one lives longer in heaven and eternal light and glory <br/>
them the other and was freed a little sooner from <br/>
this misserable wicked world. Notwithstanding <br/>
all this glory we for a moment loose sight of it <br/>
and mourn the loss but we mourn not as those <br/>
without hope.""</p>

<p>We should take warning and not <br/>
wait for the death bed to repent. As we see the <br/>
infant taken away by death so may the youth and <br/>
middle aged as well be called suddenly into eternity <br/>
Let this then prove as a warning to all not to <br/>
procrastinate repentance nor wait till a death bed comes <br/>
for it is the will of God that man should repent and <br/>
serve Him in health and strength and in the power of <br/>
his mind in order to secure his blessing and ^not^ to wait <br/>
until he is called to die.""</p>

<p>""My intention was to have treated <br/>
upon the subject of baptism; but having a case of <br/>
death before us I thought it proper to refer to that <br/>
subject. I will now however say a few words upon <br/>
baptism as designed.</p>

<p>""God has made certain decrees which</p>",
42828.0,398,,"<p>what is for the happiness and peace of this [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]] and<br/>
people for our enemies are determined to oppress us<br/>
and deprive us of our rights and privileges as they<br/>
have alone; If the authorities that be on the<br/>
earth will not assist us in our rights nor give<br/>
us that protection which the laws and constitution<br/>
of the United States and of this. State guarantee<br/>
unto us then we will claim them from Higher<br/>
Power — from Heaven — from God Almighty for<br/>
our constitutional rights.</p>

<p><strike>I swear</strike> [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] will not deal so mildly<br/>
with them again for the time has come when<br/>
forbearance is no longer a virtue; and if you are<br/>
again taken unlawfully you are not liberty to give<br/>
loose to blook and thunder but act with<br/>
Almighty power.</p>

<p>But good luck to me as it<br/>
always has been in every time of trouble, friends<br/>
though they were strangers were raise up to me<br/>
and assisted me. The time has come when<br/>
the veil is torn off the people of the State of [[Illinois|Illinois]]<br/>
and they have delivered me from the State of<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]]. The friends who were raised up<br/>
unto me would have spilt their blood for me<br/>
to have delivered me then and there but I told<br/>
them not for I should be delivered by the power<br/>
of God and Generalship.</p>

<p>I have brought the men who<br/>
arrested me to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and treated them kindly. I<br/>
have had the privilege of rewarding them good for<br/>
evil. They took me unlawfully, treated me rigorously,<br/>
strove to deprive me of my rights and would have<br/>
run me into Missouri to have been murdered<br/>
had not Providence interposed; but now they<br/>
are in my hands. I took them into my house<br/>
set them at the head of the table and placed the<br/>
best before them my house afforded and they were<br/>
waited upon by my [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|wife]] whom they deprived of</p>",

I should be discharged; but before I will bear this un-<br/>
hallowed persecution any longer I will spill my blood<br/>

money; for I have learned that they dont know<br/>
anything. I know more than they all.</p>

power in the charter of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] shall be saved:<br/>
he that beleiveth not shall not come here.</p>

is more power in other places and charters than<br/>

hand of oppression I wish you to restrain your hand<br/>
from violence against those men who arrested<br/>
me. My word is at stake. A hair of their<br/>
heads shall not be harmed.</p>

<p>My life is pledged to carry out<br/>
this great work. I know how readily you are to<br/>
do right. You have done great things and manifested<br/>
your love in flying to my assistance on this occasion.<br/>

you in the name of the Lord <strike>with all the blessings</strike></p>",
42828.0,400,,"<p>May you not have to suffer as you have suffered<br/>

all good men. He will bless you; and the time<br/>
has come when there shall be such a flocking<br/>
to the Standard of Liberty as never has been and<br/>
never shall be hereafter. What an era has<br/>
commenced? Shall the prophecies be established<br/>
by the sword? Shall we always bear? No!<br/>
Will not the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]] stay her hand<br/>
in her unhallowed persecutions against the Saints?<br/>
If she will not I restrain you not any longer.</p>

<p>I say in the name of Jesus<br/>
Christ I this day turn the key that opens the<br/>

they strike on the one cheek. Offer the other and<br/>
they will be sure to strike that also. Then defend<br/>
yourself and God shall bear you off!</p>

<p>Will any part of [[Illinois|Illinois]] say we<br/>
shall not have our rights? Treat such as strangers<br/>
and not friends and let them go to hell. Say some<br/>
we will mob you. Mob and be damned. If<br/>
I am under the necessity of giving up our chartered<br/>
rights privileges and freedom for which our fathers<br/>
fought and blead and which the Constitution of the<br/>
United States and this State guarantee to us I<br/>
will do it at the point of the bayonet and sword.</p>

<p>Many lawyers contend for that<br/>
which is against the rights of man; and I can<br/>
only excuse them because of their ignorance.</p>

<p>Go forth and advocate the rights of<br/>
the people ye lawyers. If you do not dont<br/>
get into my hands nor under the lash of my<br/>
tongue. The lawyers say the powers of<br/>
the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Charter are dangerous. But I</p>",
42828.0,401,,"<p>ask is the constitution of the United State or if this State <br/>
dangerous? No. Neither are the charters granted <br/>
unto [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] by the Legislature of [[Illinois|Illinois]] and those <br/>
who say they are, are fools.</p>

<p>We have not our rights. Those which <br/>
the Constitution of the United States grant and which <br/>
our charters grant we have not enjoyed unmolested.<br/>
[[Missouri|Missouri]] and all wicked men will raise the Hue <br/>
and Cry against us and are not satisfied. But what <br/>
are they going to do to help them selves? What will <br/>
mobocrats do in the midst of this people. If mobs <br/>
come upon you any more here dung your gardens <br/>
with them. But says one you will get up excitement. <br/>
We will get up no excitement except what we can <br/>
find and escape from. We will rise up [[George Washington|Washington]]-<br/>
like and break off the w<strike>h</strike>eight which bears us down <br/>
and we <u>will</u> <u>not</u> <u>be</u> mobbed.</p>

<p>To give you an account of my journey <br/>
I will tell you an anecdote which may be pleasing</p>

<p>A day before I was taken I rode <br/>
with my [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|wife]] through a neighbourhood to visit some <br/>
friends; and I said to Mrs Smith, ""Here are a <br/>
good people"". I felt this by the Spirit of God. <br/>
The next day I was in their <strike>hands</strike> ^midst^ a prisoner ^and^ <br/>
<strike>with</strike>^they stood by me^ [[Abel B. Wilson|Wilson]] <strike>who</strike> said as he drove up, ""Ha! ha! ha!<br/>
By God we have got the Prophet!"" He gloried <br/>
much in it but he is now our prisoner.</p>

<p>When [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] of Missouri and <br/>
Wilson of [[Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage]] came to take me ^instead^ <br/>
^of tapping^ me on the shoulder and saying <br/>
""You are my prisoner"" with two cocked pistols at <br/>
my head their first salutation was ""God damn <br/>
you I will shoot you! I will shoot you. God <br/>
damn you I will shoot you!""</p>

<p>This they did nearly fifty ^tines^ first <br/>
and <strike>at</strike> last, I asked them what the wanted to shoot <br/>
me for. </p>",
42828.0,402,,"<p>""If you make any resistance.""</p>

<p>""Oh! very well said I. I have no resistance <br/>
to make.""</p>

<p>They then draged me away; and while <br/>
on the road I asked them by what authority they did <br/>
they these things:</p>

<p>They said, ""By a writ from the <br/>
Government of [[Missouri|Missouri]] and [[Illinois|Illinois]]""</p>

<p>I then told them I wanted a Writ of Habaeus <br/>
Corpus. The reply was,</p>

<p>""God damn you! You shant have it.""</p>

<p>I told a man to go to [[Dixon, Lee County, Illinois|Dixon]] and <br/>
get me a Writ of Habaeus Corpus. [[Abel B. Wilson|Wilson]] answered</p>

<p>""God damn you! You shat have it. I <br/>
will shoot you!""</p>

<p>I sent for a lawyer to come. One <br/>
came; and [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] shut the door in his face and <br/>
would not let me speak to him and said again <br/>
""God damn you! I will shoot you!""</p>

<p>I turned to him opened my bosom <br/>
and told him to shoot away and I did ^it^ frequently.</p>

<p>I told Mr Reynolds that I <u>would</u> <br/>
have council to speak to; and the lawyers came <br/>
to me and I got a Writ of Habaeus Corpus for <br/>
myself and a writ against Wilson and Reynolds <br/>
for unlawful proceedings towards me and cruel <br/>
treatment.</p>

<p>They could not get out of town that <br/>
night. I pledged my honour to my Council that the <br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Charter had power to investigate the subject <br/>
and we came to Nauvoo by common consent and I am <br/>
now a prisoner of higher authority. Yes higher authority: <br/>
before yourselves</p>

<p>The Charter expressly say that <br/>
the City Council shall have power to enact all laws <br/>
for the benefit and convenience of said city not <br/>
contrary to the constitutions of the United States <br/>
and that of this State; and also says the Municipal </p>",
42828.0,403,,"<p>Court shall have power to grant Writ of Habeaus Corpus <br/>
in all cases arising under the ordinances of the City Council</p>

<p>There is nothing but what we have <br/>
power over except ^that^ restricted by the Constitution of the <br/>
United States or of this State. This is in accordance <br/>
with the Constitution of the United States</p>

<p>But says the mob ""What dangerous powers!""</p>

<p>But the Constitution of the United States is not <br/>
dangerous against good men neither is that of this State<br/>
but to bad men—the breakers of the law</p>

<p>As with the laws of the country so <br/>
with the ordinances of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. They are dangerous to <br/>
mobs but not to good men who wish to keep the law</p>

<p>We do not go out of Nauvoo to disturb <br/>
anybody nor any city town or place. Why need they <br/>
be troubled about us? Let them not meddle with our <br/>
affairs but let us alone.</p>

<p>After we have been deprived of our <br/>
rights and privileges as citisens,—driven from town to <br/>
town place to place and State to State, with the <br/>
sacrifice of our homes and lands,—our blood shed <br/>
and many murdered and all this because of our <br/>
religion—because we worship Almighty God according <br/>
to the dictates of our own conscience, shall we <br/>
longer bear these cruelties which have been heaped <br/>
upon us for the last ten years in the face of <br/>
heaven and in open violation of the Constitution and <br/>
laws of the United State and of this State?<br/>
May God forbid! I will not bear it. If they <br/>
take away my rights I will fight for my rights <br/>
I will fight for my rights manfully until I am <br/>
used up with blood and thunder sword and pistol.</p>

<p>We have done nothing against law<br/>
and right. As touching our City Charter and laws <br/>
there is a secret. What is it? Our laws go behind <br/>
the writ and investigate the subject <strike>ie</strike> ^that is to say^ of Habeaus <br/>
Corpus while other laws do not go behind the writ</p>

<p>You speak of lawyers. I am a </p>",
42828.0,404,,"<p>too; but the Almighty God has taught me the principle <br/>
of law; and the true meaning of the Writ of Habeaus <br/>
Corpus is to defend the inocent and investigate the subject— <br/>
go behind the writ and even if the form of the writ <br/>
should be right but issued against an inocent man <br/>
he should not be dragged to another State and there <br/>
put to death or in jeap[ardy] of life or limb because of<br/>
prejudice when he is inocent.</p>

<p>The benefits of the Constitution and <br/>
law is for all alike and the great Eloihiem <strike>or</strike> <strike>God</strike> has given <br/>
me the privilege of having the benefits of a<strike>n</strike>f the Constitution <br/>
and writ of Habeaus Corpus. I am bold to ask <br/>
for this privilege this day and to ask  you to carry <br/>
out this principle and all who are in favour of this <br/>
great principle make it manifest by raising the <br/>
right hand.""</p>

<p>—[The^re^ was a perfect sea of hands—a <br/>
universal vote. It was truly a committee of the <br/>
whole. After this strong demonstration of the feelings <br/>
of the vast multitude present Joseph continued]—</p>

<p>""In speaking of my journey to <br/>
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] I will relate a circumstance.</p>

<p>""When Mr [[Cyrus Walker|Cyrus Walker]] came <br/>
to me they said I should not speak to any man <br/>
and they would shoot any man who should speak <br/>
to me. An old man came up and said I <br/>
should have council and <strike>said</strike>^told them^ he was not affraid of <br/>
their pistols. <strike>I was delivered from them</strike></p>

<p>My freedom commenced from the time the <br/>
old man came to me and would talk to me. We <br/>
came direct from Papa Grove to Nauvoo. Our writ <br/>
was directed to the nearest court having authority to <br/>
try the case and we came to Nauvoo</p>",
42828.0,405,,"<p>It did my soul good to see your feelings and love manifested <br/>
towards me I thank God that I have the honour to lead <br/>
so virtuous and honest a people—to be your leader and <br/>
law<strike>yer</strike>^giver^ ^ver^ as [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] was to the children of [[Israel|Israel]]. Hosannah! <br/>
Hosannah! Hosannah to the name of the Most High <br/>
God. I commend you to His grace and may the <br/>
blessings of heaven rest upon you in the name of Jesus <br/>
Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>Furthermore if [[Missouri|Missouri]] continues her <br/>
warfare and continues to issue writs against me and <br/>
this people unlawfully and unjustly as <strike>they </strike> ^it^ <strike>have</strike> ^has^ done <br/>
and our rights are trampled upon and taken away <br/>
I sware with uplifted hands towards heaven I <br/>
will spill my blood in the defence. They shall not <br/>
take away our rights and if they do not stop leading <br/>
me by the nose I will lead them by the nose and <br/>
if they do not let me alone I will turn  up the <br/>
world. I will make war! When we shake <br/>
our own bushes we want to catch our own fruit</p>

<p>The lawyers themselves acknowledge <br/>
that we have all power granted us in our charters <br/>
that we could ask for—that we had more power <br/>
than any other court in the State for all other <br/>
courts were restricted while ours was not and <br/>
I thank God Almighty for it and I will not <br/>
be rode down to hell by the Missourians any <br/>
longer and it is my privilege to speak <br/>
in my own defence and appeal to your <br/>
Honors.</p>

<p>Next day July the 1st the case of <br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] came before the Municipal <br/>
Court of [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum <br/>
Smith]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and <br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] were called upon as witnesses </p>",
42828.0,406,,"<p>and duly Sworn.</p>

<p>The testimony of these witnesses occupied <br/>
nearly the entire day. They recountered the whole history <br/>
of the persecution from [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] to the time of <br/>
their expulsion from the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]] by force of <br/>
arms.</p>

<p>It was heart-rending to hear the rehersal <br/>
Never was <strike>g</strike>there given to any tribunal a history of <br/>
barbarities and religious persecution more disgraceful <br/>
to civilization for it was in the Nineteenth century <br/>
and in America. Yet that tribunal heard that <br/>
day a history of persecution in many atrocious forms <br/>
among which were the scenes of prisons chains rape <br/>
murder and expulsion and heard the horrible fact <br/>
that when [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his companions were in prison <br/>
loaded with chains they were <u>fed</u> <u>with</u> <u>nothing</u> <u>for</u><br/>
<u>five</u> <u>days</u> in succession but the <u>flesh</u> <u>of</u> <u>their</u> <u>own</u> <br/>
^<u>murdered</u>^ <u>Brethren</u> which was actually <u>cooked</u> <u>and</u> <u>given</u> <br/>
<u>them</u> <u>to</u> <u>eat</u>. This horrible fact they afterwards <br/>
discovered from the exultation of the monsters who <br/>
who the cause of this fiendish circumstance.</p>

<p>While hearing this part of <br/>
the testimony my blood boiled within me and the <br/>
spirit of war was aroused The Gentile Lawyers <br/>
who had the management of the case were shocked <br/>
to the soul and Mr [[Cyrus Walker|Wallker]] and the three other <br/>
legal gentlemen each made a speech coun<strike>c</strike>selling <br/>
us to stand for our rights at any issue.</p>

<p>The 4th of July was a great and <br/>
happy day with us in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. Joseph had just <br/>
been again delivered from the hands of Missouri <br/>
and it was also the day of our National Indipendence</p>

<p>At a very early hour people began <br/>
to assemble at the Grove and at eleven o'clock there were <br/>
congregated something near the number of 13,000 persons <br/>
and the constant accession of others swelled the <br/>
congregation to fifteen thousand persons as near as <br/>
could be estimated</p>",
42828.0,407,,"<p>In the forenoon this vast multitude was addressed <br/>
by [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] who had lately returned from [[Palestine|Palestine]] and <br/>
^who^ was now under a new appointment, to go on a mission to <br/>
St Petersburgh Russia.</p>

<p>In the afternoon three Steamers arrived <br/>
one from [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis]] one from [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] and the other from <br/>
[[Burlington, Kane County, Illinois|Burlington]] bringing altogether about nine hundred visiting <br/>
ladies and gentlemen to our [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|city]].</p>

<p>On the arrival of each boat the visitors <br/>
were escorted to the Stand by the Nauvoo Band where <br/>
they were welcomed by the firing of cannon and provided <br/>
with seats.</p>

<p>During the afternoon [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>
gave a masterly discourse and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] followed him <br/>
upon the subject of his arrest &amp;c</p>

<p><u>Synopsis</u><br/>
<u>of</u><br/>
<u>The</u> <u>Defence</u> <u>of</u> <u>Joseph</u></p>

<p><u>Before</u> <u>Fifeteen</u> <u>Thousand</u> <u>People.</u></p>

<p>If the people will give ear a moment I will <br/>
address them a few words in my own defence as <br/>
touching my arrest</p>

<p>In the first place I will state to <br/>
those who can hear me that I never spent more than <br/>
six months in [[Missouri|Missouri]] except while in prison <br/>
While I was there I was at work for the support of <br/>
my family. I never was a prisoner of war <br/>
during my stay there for I had not made war. I <br/>
never took a pistol a gun or a sword and the much <br/>
which has been said upon the subject is false <br/>
I have been willing to go before any Governor Judge <br/>
or Tribunal where justicee could be done and have the <br/>
subject investigated. I could not have committed</p>",
42828.0,408,,"<p>treason in that [[Missouri|State]] while there. I had no controle <br/>
anywhere there in temporal things but in spiritual <br/>
I was driven from that State by force of arms <br/>
under the exterminating order of Governor [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]</p>

<p>I never committed treason, the people <br/>
know very well. I have been a peaceable <br/>
citizen but there has been a great hue and cry <br/>
about Governor Boggs being shot. No crime <br/>
can be done but what it is laid to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Jo. Smith]] <br/>
Here I was again dragged to the United States <br/>
Court and was cleared and now it comes again <br/>
<strike>But</strike> As often as God sees fit for me to suffer <br/>
I am ready; but I am as inocent of these <br/>
crimes as the angels in heaven. I am not <br/>
an enemy to mankind. I am a friend <br/>
to mankind. I am not an enemy to <br/>
Missouri nor to any Governors or people.</p>

<p>As to the military station I <br/>
hold and the cause of my holding it, it is <br/>
thus:</p>

<p>When we came here the [[Illinois|State]] required <br/>
us to bear arms and do military duty according <br/>
to law; and as the Church had just been <br/>
driven from Missouri and robbed of all their <br/>
property and arms they were poor, and <br/>
destitute of arms. They were liable to be <br/>
fined for not doing duty when they had no <br/>
arms to do it with. They came to me for <br/>
advice. I advised them to organize themselves <br/>
into indipendant companies and demand arms <br/>
of the State. This they did. Again there <br/>
were many Elders having licence to preach which <br/>
by law ex^onorate^ them from military duty <br/>
but the officers would not release them on <br/>
this ground. I then told the Saints that <br/>
though I was clear of military duty by law <br/>
in consequence of lameness in one of my <br/>
legs yet I would set them the example</p>",
42828.0,409,,"<p>and do duty myself. They then said they were willing <br/>
to do duty if they could be formed into an indipendant <br/>
company and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] could be at their head. Upon this <br/>
ground came the [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Legion and I holding the <br/>
office of Lieutenant General. Not that I seek for <br/>
power.</p>

<p>And with regard to elections. Some <br/>
say we all vote together and vote as I say; but I <br/>
never tell my man how to vote nor who to vote <br/>
for. But I will show you how we have been <br/>
situated by bringing a comparison:</p>

<p>^Supposing there^ Should there be a Methodist<br/>
Society here and two candidates running for office;<br/>
one says if you will vote for me and put me in <br/>
Governor I will exterminate the Methodists and <br/>
take away their charters &amp;c. The other says <br/>
if I am Governor I will give all an equal privilege.<br/>
Which would the Methodist vote for? Of course <br/>
they would vote in mass for the candidate who <br/>
would give them their rights</p>

<p>Thus it has been with us. [[Joseph Duncan|Joseph <br/>
Duncan]] said if the people would elect him he would <br/>
exterminate the Mormons and take away their <br/>
charters. As to Mr [[Thomas Ford|Ford]] he made no such threats<br/>
but manifested a spirit in his speeches to give <br/>
every man his rights. Hence the Church universally <br/>
voted for Mr Ford and he was elected Governor <br/>
But he has issued writs against me the first time <br/>
the Missourians made the demand and this is <br/>
the second one he has issued for me which has <br/>
cause me much trouble and expence.""</p>

<p>Joseph also rehearsed the account of <br/>
his being taken by [[Thomas Reynolds|Reynolds]] and [[Abel B. Wilson|Wilson]] and <br/>
the unlawful treatment he received at their <br/>
hands. The multitude gave good attention <br/>
and much prejudice seemed to be removed</p>",
42828.0,410,,"<p>I arose early on the morning of ^the^ 7th of <br/>
July laid hands upon Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and blessed <br/>
her and our daughter [[Phoebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe Amelia]] and started <br/>
on my mission.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the same<br/>
day we left [[A. Morrison|Morrison]]s Landing  on the steam-<br/>
boat Rapids. Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]]<br/>
and myself were together of the Twelve. [[Eli P. Maginn|E. P. Magin]]<br/>
was also in our company. We arrived in [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St <br/>
Louis]] the next day.</p>

<p>I called at Mr [[William Philips|Philips]] Paper <br/>
Warehouse and made purchaces for [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]]  and <br/>
Woodruff of the ""Times and Seasons"" office and <br/>
shiped it for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>Next day we left on the ""Lancet"" bound <br/>
for [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]] where we arrived on the 13th <br/>
We had a view of President [[William Henry Harrison|Harrison]]'s Toomb<br/>
on our way</p>

<p>Elder Smith was quite ^sick^ throughout <br/>
the night of our arrival. I dreamt that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]</p>",
42828.0,411,,"<p>was again taken with another writ and was to be tried in <br/>
[[Illinois|Illinois]]. On this night [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] also dreamt that <br/>
we were called home.</p>

<p>At [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]] I shipped 30 reams of <br/>
paper for the Times and Seasons and we spent the interval <br/>
to the 22nd in visiting the Saints and Branches near; and then<br/>
left for [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] on board the Adelade <strike>for Pittsburg</strike> where <br/>
we arrived on the 27th at 6 o'clock p.m.</p>

<p>There was a meeting that night in the <br/>
city at the Temperance Hall to which we repaired and <br/>
about the first persons we saw were Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]]<br/>
and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]].</p>

<p>We heard the voice of [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] <br/>
preaching as we entered. He hammered the sects<br/>
during his discourse and at the close he informed the <br/>
people of our arrival which made six of the ^Twelve^ in the <br/>
city.</p>

<p>Next day our quorum held a council <br/>
and Brigham its president enquired concerning the <br/>
proceedings of the Twelve at Cincinnati, and found <br/>
that elders Kimball O. Pratt and John E. Page held <br/>
a conference and organized the Church there and <br/>
their Elders Pratt and Kimball left for Pittsburgh <br/>
but Elder Page stayed behind &amp; in a few days <br/>
disunited what he been done and reorganized the <br/>
Church</p>

<p>President Young reproved John E. Page <br/>
for undoing what three of the quorum of the Twelve <br/>
had done together and spoke also of[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]'s counsel<br/>
to be gentle and mild in our teachings and not <br/>
to battle with the sects but win the affections <br/>
of the people.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh resembled the English <br/>
cities in consequence of the burning of so much <br/>
stone coal which covered the ^city with the^ the dustiness of the smoke<br/>
Its population was about 35,000 it had 120 preachers<br/>
95 Churches and 21 denominations and <strike>the Branch</strike><br/>
the Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints numbered <br/>
seventy-five souls. </p>",
42828.0,412,,"<p>404</p>

<p>Sunday the 30th six of the quorum of the Twelve <br/>
met at Temperance Hall in [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] with the Saints<br/>
In the morning I addressed the meeting followed by <br/>
[[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]]; in the afternoon [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson<br/>
Pratt]], and in the evening [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] followed <br/>
by [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]].</p>

<p><u>Items</u><br/>
<u>from</u></p>

<p>Brigham Young's Remarks</p>

<p>Among many other things he said</p>

<p>""Why do the people oppose the gifts and graces?<br/>
If a man can get faith by the power of God and <br/>
the gift of the Holy Ghost so as to lay hands <br/>
upon his wife and children or friends when <br/>
they lie sick and languishing nigh unto <br/>
death and command the fever or disease or <br/>
even death itself to depart and the person is <br/>
releived I ask what harm is there in all this?<br/>
Or if a man by faith and humility before <br/>
God can get the testimony of Jesus and prophesy <br/>
of things to come or speak in tongues or cast <br/>
out devils I ask what harm in all this?<br/>
Does it do any harm? No it does not.</p>

<p>I know the New Testament <br/>
is true; for I have proved it according to <br/>
the pattern given by beleiving in Christ <br/>
obeying the Gospel and knowing the signs <br/>
do follow. Then I ask do these things<br/>
harm any one? No they do not.""</p>

<p>In speaking of the Kingdom of <br/>
God he said</p>

<p>""The Kingdom must be <br/>
together; the people must be gathered into </p>",
42828.0,413,,"<p>405</p>

<p>one place. For how would the King of [[France|France]] or [[England|England]]<br/>
succeed in undertaking to reign over a Kingdom when the <br/>
people were scattered all over the world except in France<br/>
or England. They could not reign over a people unless <br/>
the people were with those kings to reign over</p>

<p>So with the Saints. They must be <br/>
gathered together and this work has already commenced <br/>
And who is the author of this work and gathering?<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the Prophet as an instrument in the <br/>
hands of God is the Author of it. <u>He</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>greatest</u><br/>
<u>man</u> <u>on</u> <u>earth</u>. No other man of this age has <br/>
power to assemble such a great people from all the <br/>
nations of the earth with all their varied dispositions<br/>
and assimilate them and cement them together<br/>
so that they might be subject to rule and order <br/>
This the Prophet is doing; and that which makes <br/>
a great King president or man is to have a great <br/>
people to rule over.""</p>

<p>Next day our quorum assembled and took <br/>
a tour through the [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|city]]. We visited Curling's<br/>
Glass Works and saw them work through each <br/>
branch of manufacture; we then went to the <br/>
bluff above the city and had a view of the new <br/>
Basin to be filled with water forced from the <br/>
[[Allegheny River, United States|Alleghaney River]] to supply the city below of <br/>
which we had a fair view.</p>

<p>Descending the hill we had a <br/>
view of the city water works. The building was <br/>
after the Roman order cost two hundred thousand dollars <br/>
and was designed and executed by Elder [[Charles Beck|Charles Beck]]<br/>
a member of the Church of Latter-day Saints</p>

<p>Afterwards we visited Miltonburgers <br/>
Ironworks through each of its branches and saw the <br/>
keel laid for an iron steam ship of war. The keel was<br/>
140 ft. in length</p>",
42828.0,414,,"<p>406</p>

<p>Elder [[Charles Beck|Charles Beck]] paid 40 dollars for <br/>
stage fare of six of the Twelve to [[Baltimore, Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore]] and <br/>
a collection was taken up of about 20 dollars to <br/>
assist us to [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] at which place we <br/>
arrived on the 5th of August. <strike>having left [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]<br/>
on the 3rd</strike>.</p>

<p>On <strike>the</strike> ^Sunday^ afternoon of the 6th which <br/>
<strike>was Sunday</strike> we met in the Canaanite Church <br/>
about 300 Saints. Elder [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]] opened the meeting <br/>
<strike>and</strike> ^which^  President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] addressed <strike>the<br/>
meeting</strike> at considerable length. Among other <br/>
things he said</p>

<p>""A man or a woman may <br/>
ask of God and get a witness and testimony from <br/>
O concerning any work or massenger sent, <br/>
unto them; but if a person asks for a thing <br/>
that does not concern him such as governing <br/>
the Church &amp;c he will not get an answer and <br/>
if he does it will not be from God""</p>

<p>He also remarked in conversation<br/>
upon the inquiry of Who had the ^fulness of this^ Melchisidec<br/>
Priesthood that it may if any in the Church had it <br/>
he did not know it. For a person to have <br/>
^the <span class=""unclear"">[fulniss]</span> of^ that Priesthood he must be a King and a <br/>
Priest. <strike>A person</strike> ^He^ might have a portion <br/>
of it <strike>that Priesthood</strike> the same as the governors or <br/>
Judges of [[England|England]] have power from the King to <br/>
transact business but <strike>he is</strike> ^they are^ not the King <br/>
<strike>of England</strike>. A person may be anointed <br/>
King and Priest before he receives his <br/>
Kingdom &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the evening [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]<br/>
preached, followed by remarks from [[George Albert Smith|George <br/>
A Smith]]. One the morning of this <br/>
Sabath I went with Elder Young and others <br/>
to a a Millerite MEeting. Here we heard <br/>
a Mr Litz preach a sermon destroying the <br/>
literan reurn of the Jews and rebuilding of [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]</p>",
42828.0,415,,"<p>407</p>

<p>Two days afterwards the Twelve and <br/>
about 150 Saints took an excursion on board a steamer <br/>
As we glided over the water we passed the new frigate <br/>
Rariton of sixty four guns and reached [[Gloucester Point, Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloster Point]]<br/>
were we spent the day in feasting fishing swinging<br/>
walking singing and discussing various subjects</p>

<p>One of the subjects which arose <br/>
for discussion was, ""Is the prosperity of any religions <br/>
denomination a positive evidence that they are right?""</p>

<p>Elder [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] contended for <br/>
the affirmative and Elder [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|J. M. Grant]] for the negative <br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] the chairman decided that the<br/>
prosperity of any people was not positive evidence <br/>
of their being right.</p>

<p>We returned to the [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|city]] and <br/>
during the evening my mind was deeply exercised <br/>
with the impression taht my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] was in distress <br/>
or afflicted. I prayed for her before the Lord <br/>
and my mind was releived</p>

<p>During the week we held meetings <br/>
several times and visited public places.</p>

<p>on one of the days Elders Young <br/>
[[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]] [[George Albert Smith|G. A Smith]] myself and [[Peter Hesse Jr.|P. Hesse]] visited <br/>
the State House and on the tope of the teeple we <br/>
had a fine view of the city of Philadelphia<br/>
Descending to the [[Independence Hall, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Indipendance Hall]] we saw the <br/>
place where the Patriots signed the Declaration <br/>
and sat in the chair in which [[John Hancock|John Hancock]]<br/>
sat in at the time he signed that instrument</p>

<p>Next day we visited barious parts <br/>
of the city especially [[Peale Museum, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Peel's Museum]] where among many <br/>
other things of note we saw and examined the body <br/>
of the Mermaid and the skeleton of a Mamouth</p>

<p>On the 14th I parted from the <br/>
Philadelphia Saints and in company with Elders <br/>
Orson Pratt and [[William Moore|Wm Moor]] took steamboat to <br/>
[[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Skoolkill]] and then walked 6 miles to Mr. [[Titus Mousley|Mosley]]'s <br/>
and preached in the evening followed by O. Pratt</p>",
42828.0,416,,"<p>408</p>

<p>We journeyed 24 miles the next day and <br/>
during our days ride we passed over the ground of <br/>
the Brandywine battle saw where the action commenced <br/>
were the Americans retreated and a part of them surrendered <br/>
and saw also where [[George Washington|Washington]] led away the remainder <br/>
of the army</p>

<p>The day after Elder [[William Moore|Moor]] and <br/>
myself travelled 25 miles to brother [[John Neff, b. 1794|John Neff]]'s in <br/>
[[Strasburgh, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Strasburgh]] and found him disposed to sell his <br/>
property and go to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and take stock in the <br/>
[[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] <strike>&amp;c [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]</strike> On the way we passed by <br/>
the country throughout this region exceedingly rich <br/>
and fertile</p>

<p>We continued our journey on <br/>
the succeeding day to [[West Nantmeal Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|West Nantmeal]] and on <br/>
the next in the evening met with Elder [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] <br/>
and others and held meeting at West Nantmeal<br/>
Seminary and the day after commenced a two <br/>
days meeting 12 miles distant in a Grove in <br/>
[[Uwchlan Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Uwchland Township]]</p>

<p>The second day of our camp <br/>
meeting was Sunday August 20th. A good <br/>
congregation came together and I addressed them <br/>
in the forepart of the day from the text—""If <br/>
our Gospel be hid it is hid to them that are less"" &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Elder O. Pratt <br/>
delivered a powerful discourse from Revelations <br/>
22 ch 3rd verse ""And there shall be no more <br/>
curse. He began with the fall and <br/>
traced his subject through to the Millennium the <br/>
Second Advent the binding of Satan and the <br/>
New heaven and the New earth when Christ shall <br/>
deliver the Kingdom up unto his Father and the <br/>
last enemy Death be destroyed.</p>

<p>Next day we returned by <br/>
rail to [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] where we met Elder [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]]</p>",
42828.0,417,,"<p>409</p>

<p>but found that the rest of the Twelve had left the [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|city]] for <br/>
[[New York|New York]] where we followed them two days later</p>

<p>Conference at New York<br/>
held<br/>
August 26, 1843.</p>

<p>The quorum of the Twelve met the Saints <br/>
in Conference at New York on this day</p>

<p>After prayer President [[Brigham Young|Young]] opened <br/>
the buisness of the Conference by an interesting address<br/>
upon the subject of the gathering, — the President and the <br/>
building of the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]].</p>

<p>In the afternoon Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]<br/>
spoke very graphically in parables; and Elder [[George Albert Smith|George<br/>
A. Smith]] followed with anecdotes: One related to <br/>
his collegiate education received from the Prophet which <br/>
was to preach short sermons and make short prayers</p>

<p><u>Remarks</u> <u>of</u> <u>President</u> <u>Brigham</u> <u>Young</u></p>

<p>Elder Young next spoke; and among other remarks <br/>
he said</p>

<p>""The Scriptures have been mistified <br/>
to that degree that the greatest divine of the day is <br/>
as ignorant as the dumb ass concerning the things <br/>
of God. They know not their right hand <br/>
from their left and we are trying to reverse it <br/>
by making the things of God so simple that <br/>
the people can understand</p>

<p>Place a man in this room who <br/>
is ignorant of science and take everything out that <br/>
we can see and then ask him if there is anything <br/>
in the room. He will say no nothing but <br/>
us two. I tell him there are millions of live<br/>
animals in the room and that even we breathe them</p>",
42828.0,418,,"<p>410</p>

<p>and [[Brigham Young|I]] will show him by the aid of the ms<br/>
that there are live animals in one drop of water <br/>
eight feet long but he will not beleive me until <br/>
he sees it through the magnifying glass.</p>

<p>So with the unbeleiver. He <br/>
does not beleive<strike>d</strike> in God — in angels — in spirits<br/>
because he does not see them but let him have <br/>
spiritual glasses — or let him obey the commandments <br/>
of God and get the Spirit of God and then <br/>
he can see.""</p>

<p>The following was also given</p>

<p><u>Interesting Questions &amp; Answers</u></p>

<p>2st. Ques. can any oficer in a Branch of the <br/>
Church say his word is law and should be <br/>
obeyed?</p>

<p>Ans., No.</p>

revelation concerning themselves. They may <br/>
get a revelation in any part of the world <br/>
concerning the building up of the Kingdom <br/>
as they have to establish the Kingdom in <br/>
all parts of the world. So any person <br/>
can ask the Lord for a witness concerning <br/>
himself. He can obtain an answer for</p>",
42828.0,419,,"<p>411</p>

<p>himself but not to lead the Church. That belongs to <br/>
the head of the Church.""</p>

<p>On the following day Conference was <br/>
continued. Meeting was opened by singing and <br/>
prayer by Elder [[Jedediah Morgan Grant|Grant]] after which Elder Woodruff<br/>
delivered a discourse from the 2nd Epistle of [[Peter (NT)|Peter]]<br/>
1st ch., <strike>&amp;c</strike> 20, 21 verses.</p>

<p>Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] followed with <br/>
some appropriate remarks and in the afternoon <br/>
[[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] gave a lengthy discourse proving the <br/>
divine mission of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and the truth <br/>
of the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>In the evening Elder [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]]<br/>
delibered a masterly discourse upon the Book of <br/>
Mormon. He said it was the history of <br/>
nearly one half of the Globe and of the people who <br/>
had inhabited it, — that it gave the history <br/>
of all the cities which had since it cam forth <br/>
been discovered by Cartherwood and Stephens —<br/>
that it spoke of the establishing of our government <br/>
and what is more highly interesting it revels <br/>
its final fate and destiny so that by reading <br/>
the Book of Mormon it may be clearly seen <br/>
what will befall this nation and what will <br/>
be its final end. In that Book is also the <br/>
Gospel as taught by Jesus Christ himself to the <br/>
ancient inhabitants of America and an account</p>",
42828.0,420,,"<p>412</p>

<p>of his ministry amongst them after his resurrection<br/>
and Assension. This was the path of his discourse <br/>
occupying nearly two hours.</p>

<p>I left [[New York|New York]] on the 24th in <br/>
company with Elders [[Elisha Hildebrand Davis|Davis]] and [[Charles Wesley Wandell|Wandell]] and having <br/>
visited Branches on my road I arrived at [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]<br/>
my native place on the 2nd of September and <br/>
left my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]'s house again on the 5th and <br/>
on the 8th arrived at the City of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] where <br/>
I found Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and another <br/>
brother waiting for me at the station.</p>

<p>Conference</p>

<p>held by <br/>
The Quorum of the Twelve<br/>
at<br/>
at Boston in Boylston Hall<br/>
Sep. 9th, 1843,</p>

<p>There were present of the quorum of the Twelve<br/>
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]<br/>
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] Wilford Woodruff<br/>
and [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]]</p>

<p>Elder G. A. Smith opened the <br/>
Conference by prayer and then President Young<br/>
called for the business of the meeting after which the <br/>
churches were represented</p>

<p>During this conference there <br/>
were discourses delivered by all the members of <br/>
the quorum of the Twelve present their subjects<br/>
being chiefly upon the gathering building the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]<br/>
and kindred matters. It would be too lengthy to <br/>
give the synopsis of the whole of them as recorded <br/>
in my daily Journal of the time. The substance <br/>
of several must suffice.</p>",
42828.0,421,,"<p>413</p>

<p>[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] led the van upon the Gathering <br/>
and then President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] further laid before <br/>
the Conference the subject and design of this mission <br/>
of the Twelve to the eastern churches.</p>

<p>Synopsis<br/>
of the</p>

<p>Discourse of President Brigham Young</p>

<p>I wish to make a few remarks <br/>
concerning the subject of our faith. We hear the <br/>
Elders represent the feelings of the brethren concerning <br/>
the gathering</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Lord Jesus <br/>
Christ is a gathering Spirit. Its tendency is to <br/>
gather the virtuous and good — the honest and meek <br/>
of the earth — in fine the Saints of God.</p>

<p>The time has come when the <br/>
<strike>virtuous and</strike> ^Lord has^ determined to fulfill his pruposes <br/>
""Had we lived in the days of Christ,"" the people <br/>
say, we would have received his work. But judge<br/>
ye if the people are better now than they were then. <br/>
They are not.</p>

<p>When the full set time was come <br/>
the Lord came in the flesh to do his work whether <br/>
the people were prepared or not. And <u>now</u><br/>
the full set time is come for the Lord God Almighty <br/>
to set his hand to redeem [[Israel|Israel]]</p>

<p>We are not bound to make the <br/>
people beleive but to preach the Gospel and then <br/>
our garments are clear.</p>

<p>The Lord does not require every <br/>
soul to leave his home as soon as he beleives <br/>
but he requires him to hearken to counsel and <br/>
follw that course which the Lord points out</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Almighty <span class=""unclear"">[an[d]]</span><br/>
of this work is on the <strike>elect</strike> ^alert^ and those who keep</p>",
42828.0,422,,"<p>414</p>

<p>up with the work must be on the alert also</p>

<p>When the Lord says gather <br/>
yourselves together why do you ask Him, what <br/>
for? Is it not the principle of the Saints to <br/>
mingle together to promote the great cause in <br/>
which we are engaged?</p>

<p>To you Say, cannot the Lord <br/>
save us as well where we are as <strike>to</strike>^when^   gathered together?<br/>
Yes if the Lord says so but if he commands <br/>
us to come out and gather together He will <br/>
not save us by ^our^ staying at home. Have you <br/>
not received the Gospel? Yes. Then do <br/>
you beleive what we say. Have you not received <br/>
the Holy Ghost by receiving the Gospel which <br/>
we have brought and it stands as a testimony <br/>
that God has a Prophet upon the earth</p>

<p>You might have been baptized <br/>
seventy times seven in any way except the one <br/>
God ordained and pointed out and you would <br/>
not have received the Holy Ghost. This also <br/>
is a testimony to you.</p>

<p>Are you engaged in the great work with us? You will say Yes. Can you <br/>
do any good? <strike>you</strike> ^You can^ The Sectarian world <br/>
saw the Bible to the nations of the earth. The <br/>
people put in sixpence fifty cents or a dollar into <br/>
the box and send Bibles through the world. Then <br/>
cannot you do something? Yes.</p>

<p>The Lord requires us to build <br/>
a house unto His name that the ordinances and <br/>
blessings of his Kingdom might be revealed and <br/>
that the Elders may be endorsed to go forth and <br/>
gather together the Good of [[Ephraim (OT)|Ephraim]] — the people <br/>
of God from the ends of the earth</p>

<p>Can you get an endowment in <br/>
[[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]]? No. And only in that place which <br/>
God has appointed.</p>",
42828.0,423,,"<p>415</p>

<p>Now query: Could [[Moses (OT)|Moses]] have got the <br/>
law had he remained in the midst of the children of <br/>
[[Israel|Israel]] and not gone into the mountsin? The Lord said <br/>
Go and do so and so. Stand before Pharoah. Pull off <br/>
your shoes for the ground is holy &amp;c. Moses obeyed <br/>
and obtained the blessing; but if he had not obeyed he <br/>
would not have obtained the blessing.</p>

<p>But why query about it at all? Has <br/>
the Lord spoken? Yes. Then that is enough. [[Brigham Young|I]] <br/>
do not care whether the people gather or not. If they <br/>
don't want to I do not wish to have the people against <br/>
their will. I wish you to have youre choice — either to <br/>
gather with the righteous or they with the wicked. <br/>
I would like to have all people bow down to the Lord <br/>
Jesus Christ but it is one of the decrees of the Lord <br/>
that all persons shall act upon their agency which <br/>
was the case even with the angels that fell from heaven</p>

<p>Now will you help us build <br/>
the [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] and [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]? If so you will <br/>
be blessed; if not we will build it alone. And <br/>
if you do not hearken you will not have the <br/>
Spirit of the Lord for the Spirit of the Lord <br/>
is in the gathering.</p>

<p>The Apostles tried to gather <br/>
together the people in their den. Christ said he <br/>
would have gathered the Jews oft as a hen gathereth <br/>
her chicken under her wings; but they would <br/>
not</p>

<p>It mattereth not to God and angels<br/>
whether men hear or forbear. They will carry <br/>
on their work for the full set time is come <br/>
<u>We</u> care about it. We must build a house and <br/>
get an endowment and preach the gospel warn <br/>
the people gather the Saints build up Zion <br/>
finish out work and be prepared for the coming <br/>
of Christ</p>

<p>Now we want to send missionaries</p>",
42828.0,424,,"<p>416</p>

<p>to the Islands. Can you do something for the And <br/>
that is not all. We want you to contribute to the <br/>
building of the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]]. We want what you have to <br/>
spare. but are you affraid that you will not have <br/>
enough for yourselves when you get there? How easy <br/>
it is for the Lord to take it away from you by <br/>
fire and otherwise. [[Eli P. Maginn|E. P. Magin]] had an ivory <br/>
cane. [[Brigham Young|I]] asked him for it but he did not give <br/>
it to me; but he soon lost it and it did neither <br/>
of us any good</p>

<p>The Lord can give and take away <br/>
[[Jacob (OT)|Jacob]] with his faith obtained all the best cattle that <br/>
his father in law had. Who blessed you and all the <br/>
people. God. But do the people acknowledge <br/>
His hand in all things. No they turn away<br/>
from Him and do not acknowledge Him nor realize<br/>
from whom their blessings flow</p>

<p>Let me tell you a secret. When <br/>
the Lord shakes the earth and the hills fall <br/>
down and the valleys are exalted then for brass<br/>
He will bring gold for iron silver and for stones <br/>
iron. That you will have no use for gold <strike>and</strike> ^for money^<br/>
<strike>the like</strike> as you now have but the Lord will think <br/>
as much of it then as now.</p>

<p>Let us have some of your gold <br/>
to take to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo <br/>
House]] so that when the kings princes and nobles <br/>
of the earth call to enquire after the wisdom of Zion<br/>
we may have a place to entertain them, and <br/>
that the weary traveller may also be refreshed</p>

<p>Is there wisdom in Zion? We think <br/>
so; and the world begin to think so. Let the world <br/>
come forty and translate the plates that have of late <br/>
come forth if they have wisdom to do it;</p>

<p>The Lord intends to take away <br/>
the gods of the gentiles. He pulleth down and <br/>
buildeth up at his own pleasure. Dont be affraid<br/>
of a dollar or a hundred or a thousand dollars</p>",
42828.0,425,,"<p>417</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] would not. I have made sacrifices a great many <br/>
times. The Lord has promised a hundred fold and <br/>
I have taken this course to get rich — to give all <br/>
I had and God has given me many blessings in <br/>
consequence. If I have been too bold in asking them <br/>
be you too bold in giving. Give your all and <br/>
God will repay as much again.""</p>

<p>In the afternoon [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]] took up <br/>
the subject of the morning. He said they not only <br/>
wanted the gold and the silver but we thank you<br/>
and your wives and children and all you have <br/>
He then spoke of the policy of [[Joseph (OT)|Joseph]] in [[Egypt|Egypt]]<br/>
and closed by saying</p>

<p>""Does the Saints here in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]]<br/>
know they are identified with the laying of the foundation <br/>
of a great and mighty work that is to enclude<br/>
all the great and glorious purposes of God which <br/>
are to be fulfilled in the last dispensation and <br/>
fulness of times. And I prophesy in the <br/>
name of the Lord that whether the Boston Saints <br/>
or who may stand for it or rise against it <br/>
that almost numberless millions will celebrate <br/>
that day when the foundation of this work <br/>
was laid.""</p>

<p>Elder [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] followed <br/>
upon the subject of what ^seems^ to the people but small <br/>
things in the revelations of God in variouss ages <br/>
but showed their great importance in the issue <br/>
and instanced the building the ark &amp;c. He <br/>
also took up the gathering and treated the meeting <br/>
to a spice of common ^sense^ versus the mysteries and <br/>
concluded with an illustrative anecdote of how <br/>
Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] was sent for by a certain people <br/>
and brought forty miles to preach the mysteries <br/>
and the amusing sequel of how he read them <br/>
a lesson of practical religion</p>",
42828.0,426,,"<p>418</p>

<p>Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] arose and said</p>

<p>""I will ^offer^ an apology for my remarks <br/>
in the forefront of the day. Some may think <br/>
I spoke very plain but the apology I have to <br/>
make is that I will turn Thomsonion docter <br/>
and give the composition without sweetening. This <br/>
work is all — it is my all. If this work does <br/>
not live God knows I do not want to live; <br/>
and I want you to understand that he that <br/>
gathereth not with us scattereth and they that <br/>
have tasted the bitter cup will feel it</p>

<p>Wake up ye Elders who <br/>
have sought to build yourselves up and not <br/>
the Kingdom of God! Wake  up ye who <br/>
have daubed with untempered morter. Hearken <br/>
and hear me for I say unto ^you^ that if you <br/>
do not help us build the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo<br/>
House]] you shall not inherit the land of <br/>
Zion. If you do not help build up Zion <br/>
and the cuase of God you shall not partake <br/>
of their blessings.</p>

<p>Many Elders seek to build <br/>
themselves up and not the work of God; but <br/>
when any one does this no matter who he <br/>
may be ^he will not prosper^ even if one of the Twelve. As to <br/>
those of the Twelve and others of the Elders who <br/>
have apostatised I have known their hearts &amp;<br/>
their breathings and known their movements <br/>
They thoughtI did not know much but <br/>
I knew all abou t them; and when I see<br/>
men preaching he build themselves up and <br/>
not Zion I know what it will end in. But <br/>
say you I am young. I do not care if <br/>
you are young. Do you know what you <br/>
are about. If so preach and labour for the <br/>
building up of the city of Zion. Concentrate <br/>
your means and influence there and not scatter<br/>
abroad. Be faithful or you will not be</p>",
42828.0,427,,"<p>419</p>

<p>chosen; for the day of choosing is at the door.</p>

<p>Why be afraid of a sacrifice?<br/>
[[Brigham Young|I]] have given my all many times and am willing <br/>
to do it again. I would be glad to hear the Lord<br/>
say through His servant [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], let my servant<br/>
Brigham give again all he has. I would obey in <br/>
a moment if it took the last coat from off my <br/>
back""</p>

<p><u>Remarks of Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]</u></p>

<p>Among other things he said</p>

<p>""I speak in parables. I conpare <br/>
the Saints to a good cow. When you milk her<br/>
clean she will always have abundance of milk to <br/>
give; but if you milk her a little <strike>and</strike> she will <br/>
soon dry up. So with the Saints. If they <br/>
do but little in building up Zion they soon have <br/>
but little to do with. This was the case <br/>
in [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]]. I had a dream concerning <br/>
the Saints there. I thought I was in a field <br/>
of wheat that was staked up; and we had to <br/>
draw it into the barn; but when we came to <br/>
open the stack the bundles would all fall to <br/>
pieces and it was filled with clusters of rats <br/>
and mice who had been eating up the grain<br/>
I thought that these rats and mice were the <br/>
Elders and official members of the Church — living on the wheat, <br/>
eating them up instead of building up new<br/>
churches so that when the Twelve came along <br/>
they could not get anything for the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] or <br/>
[[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House]] or hardly a place to stay the <br/>
rats had eaten up the wheat so. We had to <br/>
go to the world for a home to stay while we <br/>
were there.</p>

<p>We are not polished stones like Elders</p>",

<p>[[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Babbit]] [[George Washington Joshua Adams|Adams]] [[James Blakesly|Blakely]] [[Eli P. Maginn|Magin]] and the like. We <br/>
are rough stones out of the mountain and when we <br/>
roll through the forest and knock the bark off <br/>
the trees it does not hurt us even if we should <br/>
get a corner knocked off occassionally. The more <br/>
we roll and get the corners knocked off the better <br/>
we are; but if we were polished and smooth when <br/>
we got the corners knocked off it would deface <br/>
us</p>

<p>This is the case with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]].<br/>
He never professed to be a dressed smooth polished <br/>
stone but was rough out of the mountains and <br/>
has been rolling among the rocks and trees and it <br/>
has not hurt him at all. But he will be as <br/>
smooth and polished in the end as any other <br/>
stone while many that were so very polished and <br/>
smooth in the beginning yet badly defaced and <br/>
spoiled while rolling about.""</p>

<p>Elders [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] followed and <br/>
then the Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock the <br/>
next morning</p>

<p>^We continued^ Conference the next day which was <br/>
Sunday and in the morning I preached a lengthy <br/>
discourse forom the 3rd ch of [[Amos (OT)|Amos]] verse 7th.</p>

<p>I left [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on the 12th of September <br/>
at 5 o'clock p.m. in the Express train for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]<br/>
and at about 10 o'clock while passing through [[Chesterwoods, Maine|Chester<br/>
woods]] 6 miles south of [[Kennebunk, York County, Maine|Kennebunk]] the engine <br/>
was thrown from the track in consequence of a rail<br/>
being raised eight inches by some designing misreant<br/>
The force was such that it drove the engine <br/>
about five rods ahead and smashed it to pieces with <br/>
the baggage cars piled upon the top of it</p>

<p>One lady was brused but not dangerously <br/>
and another was slightly injured. The lives of many <br/>
were in danger and it seemed a mystry that so little</p>",
42828.0,429,,"<p>421</p>

<p>injury was done. Four cars were filled with passengers and <br/>
had not the force of the coll^ission^ been broken by the baggage <br/>
cars many lives would have been lost.</p>

<p>The baggge cares w^ere^ soon on fire which <br/>
was with difficulty extinguished. The fireman was <br/>
thrown about three <span class=""unclear"">[rods]</span> and escaped with a slight injury <br/>
but the engineer Mr Adams from [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]] was <br/>
burried beneath the pile and instantly killed and the <br/>
ruins had to be removed before the corps of the illfated <br/>
engineer could be optained. No blame could be <br/>
attached to him for the raised rail gave no warning <br/>
until the engine and baggage cars were in one pile <br/>
of ruins. The unfortunate man left a wife and <br/>
one child</p>

<p>A Mr [[Thomas Hall|Thomas Hall]] opened his <br/>
house for the passengers and much praise was due <br/>
to him and his houshold for their hospitality</p>

<p>I spent most of the night in the <br/>
woods and got chilled through</p>

<p>They sent to Portland for another <br/>
engine which arrived in time to take us to Portland <br/>
in the morning.</p>

<p>Arriving at Portland I furnished the <br/>
Editor of the American with</p>

<p>The Account of our Railway Accident</p>

<p>I visited my brother in-law [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra Carter]] and <br/>
wrote t^wo^ more letters giving an account of the foregoing <br/>
catastrophe — one was to the Editor of the ""Boston Bee""<br/>
the other to Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] Editor of the ""Times <br/>
and Seasons""</p>

<p>On the same day I walke to <br/>
[[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarbourough]] and arrived in the evening at the house <br/>
of my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]'s parents. Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter]] was at [[New York|New<br/>
York]] I came upon [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]] so sudden as she <br/>
was walking across the room with a candle that <br/>
she was as much surprised as though I had came</p>",
42828.0,430,,"<p>422</p>

<p>down from the skies and [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|her]] first salutation was where<br/>
did you come from?</p>

<p>This was the first time I had been to <br/>
my f [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]'s parents house without Phebe being with me <br/>
and I felt like the dove without its mate. But <br/>
after conversing till 9 o'clock with mother and [[Joseph Fabyan Carter|Fabyan]]<br/>
my wife's brother<strike>-in-law</strike> I prayed with them and <br/>
then retired to my chamber and there prayed for my <br/>
absent companion and our children.</p>

<p>Next day I rode round the country <br/>
with my brother-in-law Fabyan visiting our friends <br/>
and relations. I called at Mr [[Arthur Milliken|Milliken]]s and <br/>
found Arthur Milliken and his wife [[Lucy Smith Millikin|Lucy]] the youngest <br/>
sister of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. They were both home <br/>
sick for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]</p>

<p>The next two days passed in <br/>
family associations and after spending the evening of <br/>
the second day in conversing with Faban, [[Rhoda Milliken Carter|Rhoda]]<br/>
and mother about Mormonism <strike>&amp;c</strike> I took my light <br/>
and went to bed fearing I should not see [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Father]]<br/>
but just as I was about to blow the light out a wagon <br/>
drove up and I jumped out of bed dressed and was <br/>
soon down grasping the hand of my wife's father.<br/>
I sat up and talked with him till about 11 o'clock <br/>
and I thought both Father and Mother looked no <br/>
older than when I saw them before and they were <br/>
enjoying excellent health. It seemed quite natural <br/>
the next morning to sit at the table with my <br/>
wife's parents again but I very much missed <br/>
Phebe during this visit. The day after<br/>
I took my final call upon my friends and relatives <br/>
and bade them adieu and then took the <br/>
cars and arrived in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] that night.</p>

<p>The next day after my return <br/>
to Boston I called upon [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and <br/>
<strike>W. W.</strike> [[William Wines Phelps|Phelps]]. In the afternoon I went on <br/>
the parade ground and saw the militia in a sham <br/>
fight and they made quite a splendid appearance</p>",
42828.0,431,,"<p>[4]23</p>

<p>On the following evening I visited the celebrated <br/>
phenologist [[Orson Squire Fowler|O. S. Fowler]] of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] who had examined<br/>
the heads of the Twelve. He gave me</p>

<p>My Phenological Chart.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff:</p>

<p>Is a man of great action both <br/>
physical and mental; does up things in a hurry;<br/>
lets nothing sleep in his hands; great resolution;<br/>
steamboat speed; loves his liberty; is not disposed <br/>
to be subject to the will or dictations of others; has <br/>
great indipendance; difficulties only stimulate him<br/>
to increased action; goes in for the largest liberty <br/>
of the mass and is a democrat of the old school; <br/>
prefers utility to beauty and substance to show; <br/>
highly social and fond of family and friends; has <br/>
but few secrets of his own and tells the plain un-<br/>
varnished facts; fears but little danger; is not <br/>
irressolute but de<strike>s</strike>cides and proceeds at once to action;<br/>
His first thoughts are always best. He does up his <br/>
own religious thinking and does not hang his hopes upon <br/>
the faith of others. He believes but little without proof; <br/>
is a two edged sword — if he does not cut one way, <br/>
does another. He makes positive friends or positive <br/>
enemies; has much severity; is sarcastic; bitter<br/>
in reporaches; means to do right; feals the <br/>
force of moral obligations. His jokes have more <br/>
vinegar than molasses in them. He recollects <br/>
and explains facts well; reasons by inference from <br/>
the facts, by analogy and induction; has good <br/>
talking talents; and is noted for his clear illustrations</p>

[[B. J. Gray|B. J. Gray]] Sect<sup>y</sup>.</p>",
42828.0,432,,"<p>424</p>

<p>I took a walk with [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] to [[Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Charleston]]<br/>
on the 22nd. We first visited the Navy Yard of the <br/>
United States then the dry dock and next the U.S. <br/>
Rope Walk which we inspected in all its branches</p>

<p>We took dinner and then visited <br/>
[[Bunker Hill Monument, Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Bunker Hill Monument]]. I entered the tube and <br/>
was drawn up by steam 2<strike>0</strike>20 feet when I had a <br/>
view of all [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] Charleston [[Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] [[Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Chelsea]] &amp;c<br/>
and then descended by the same way. Next <br/>
came the State prisons with 262 prisoners as their <br/>
various branches of business</p>

<p>After seeing each appartment <br/>
we returned to Boston where we held meeting which <br/>
was addressed by [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]]<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith</p>

<p>Next day ^23rd^ I called upon brother<br/>
Heber C. Kimball who let me have one hundred dollars <br/>
on P. P. Pratts act to purchse paper with; and on the same <br/>
day started per rail to [[Westfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts|Westfield]] and when <strike>we</strike> ^I^<br/>
got to my destination for the day I found that <br/>
P. P. Pratt and [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] were in the car before <br/>
me without our knowing it. I parted with them <br/>
and they continued homeward</p>

<p>I continued my journey the next <br/>
day ^24th^ and on the following I reached [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]<br/>
my native place and four days later again <br/>
left my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]'s house and arrived in [[New York|New York]]<br/>
on the next day where I found Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham<br/>
Young]].</p>

<p>On the 3rd of October I took <br/>
steamboat to [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and in the evening <br/>
there met five of the quorum of the Twelve and <br/>
other Elders</p>

<p>Next day the others of the quorum <br/>
of the Twelve started for [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] I also left for <br/>
home on the following day and a large number of <br/>
the Saints started per rail from Philadelphia in <br/>
the morning bound for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]].</p>",
42828.0,433,,"<p>[4]25</p>

<p>On my journey homeward I made large purchases of <br/>
paper &amp;c at</p>

<p>An Exciting Part of My Journey.</p>

<p>The 19th was one of the most exciting and dangerous day's <br/>
journey possible in any persons life and the scenes through <br/>
which we passed was full of the grand and awful</p>

<p>Our boat was drawn out of the canal on <br/>
cars prepared to run ^on^ the railroad to convey us over the [[Allegheny Mountains, United States|Allegany <br/>
mountain]]</p>

<p>It was a novel scene indeed to see a canal <br/>
boat taken apart into four sections loaded with freights and <br/>
passengers and hoisted ^on^ a railroad by incline plains into the <br/>
air 1500 feet over the highest mountains and then descend <br/>
into the valley below in the same way</p>

<p>^On starting^ Horses were hitched to our cars and they drew <br/>
us four miles and a half and then we were at the first incline <br/>
plain which we had to as<strike>s</strike>cend. Two cars were fastened <br/>
at the tope of the plain to the same rope that connected <br/>
with ours at the bottom and the engine was stationed <br/>
in a building at the sum<strike>i</strike>mit of the plain which <br/>
drew up and let down the cars</p>

<p>When all was ready the signal <br/>
was given by raising a red flag the engine was <br/>
put in motion and the cars started. The first <br/>
plain was half a mile long and raised one hundred <br/>
and eighty feet. We went up in two minutes <br/>
and I was thankful to reach the top for had <br/>
the rope broke or the fastning become untied we <br/>
should have rolled back to the bottom with a tremendious <br/>
crash</p>

<p>Plain No 2 raised 125 feet in half <br/>
a mile and our boat rocked badly while going up <br/>
but no accident hapened. We then continued on</p>",
42828.0,434,,"<p>a level until we came to the next incline plain.</p>

<p>Plain No 3. was one mile and a quarter <br/>
long and it rose 320 feet which we ascended in four <br/>
minutes. Before we reached the top the safty car<br/>
which was attached to our boat was thrown from <br/>
the track <strike><span class=""unclear"">[which]</span></strike> ^and^ dragged many rods throwing the <br/>
rope off the wheels. I made a sign to the <br/>
engineer who stoped and it was replaced. Here <br/>
again we were in danger of breaking the rope which <br/>
would have sent us back down the mountain more <br/>
than a mile or turned us over into the yawing<br/>
gulf below. In either case we should have <br/>
been dashed to atoms. My hair rose on my <br/>
head but having got all things ready we proceeded <br/>
on to Plain No 4.</p>

<p>This plain was three quarters <br/>
of a mile long and ascended 265 feet. We <br/>
reached the surmount of this in three minutes but <br/>
it looked awful to be thus suspended almost <br/>
in the air with such a weight of lives and freight <br/>
depending upon a know, a rope, a pin, an <br/>
engine and the care of a man which should either <br/>
give way would have dashed us to atoms unles<br/>
saved by a miracle</p>

<p>We next continued on to Plain<br/>
No 5 which was 3/4 of a mile long and rose 280 feet <br/>
This we ascended also in three minutes wihch <br/>
brought us on to the Summit of the [[Allegheny Mountains, United States|Allegany <br/>
mountains]] four miles from the base and eleven <br/>
hundred and seventy feet in height.</p>

<p>I felt thankful to God that <br/>
we were on the top of the mountain alive but <br/>
we had to descend in the same way that we <br/>
ascended. There was snow on the Summit and it was <br/>
exceedingly cold. We ran on the top of the mountain <br/>
about three miles and then began to descend</p>

<p>There were six incline plains <br/>
to descend to the bottom of the mountain the </p>",
42828.0,435,,"<p>427</p>

<p>whole of which was attended with equal danger and carelessness</p>

<p>As we came upon the brink of one of them <br/>
it was found the men had left the breakers and the cars <br/>
were about to run down the horses. The conducter seeing <br/>
this followed for the men to break but finding no one at the breakers<br/>
and the cars approaching the incline plain the teamster <br/>
liberated his horses as soon as possible and they only just <br/>
escaped being run down and the conductor sprang to the <br/>
breaker himself and with great exertion barely saved us from <br/>
madly running down the plain and being dashed to atoms</p>

<p>I was standing in the cars at the <br/>
time and instantly throwing off my cloak prepared myself <br/>
for leaping out in case the cars should start down the <br/>
plain. In either case it might have killed me but <br/>
I knew it was certain death to be dashed downward and <br/>
close the alternative of a desperate chance in leaping out <br/>
but through the mercy of God we were stoped at the <br/>
very brink</p>

<p>The whole passage across the mountains<br/>
was a constant scene of danger and I called upon God <br/>
in my heart to preserve my life</p>

<p>Even while on a level we were running <br/>
on the edge of a precipice hundreds of feet deep over <br/>
which if a wheel had broken or run off the track the <br/>
cars would have plunged awfully down and made an <br/>
end of all flesh on board.</p>

<p>We passed through one tunnel in the <br/>
mountain and when we reached the bottom of the incline <br/>
plains I felt thankful to God that we were mostly <br/>
out of danger but the^y^ put the boat together and started <br/>
on the rail with all on board without horse or steam<br/>
and the railroad being a little on the descent it increased <br/>
in speed until it ran at a rapid rate and we <br/>
were still in danger of being upset. The train ran <br/>
of itself for about four miles until it came to the <br/>
canal and here again to finish the day with <br/>
danger a train of cars was left in our track and <br/>
with all the power that could be exerted on the breaks</p>",
42828.0,436,,"<p>we just escaped a smash up at last. We finally got <br/>
launched into the water again with no bones broken or <br/>
lives lost. In conversing <strike>to</strike> ^with^ the mate in the evening<br/>
upon the subject of our passage across the mountains <br/>
he remarked we were not sensible of one half <br/>
the danger we had passed during the day but for <br/>
one I was sensible of a great deal at least</p>

<p>Two days after this we arrived <br/>
at [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] and I immediately engaged passage <br/>
for myself and freight of paper to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis]] started <br/>
the same day and met Elder [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] at <br/>
[[Beaver, Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Bever]] with a company of 50 Saints bound for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
Next day they took passage on the North Bend<br/>
and on the Alps</p>

<p>Passing over farther intermediates<br/>
of my journey I arrived in St Louis re-shipped<br/>
my freight and reached Nauvoo on the 4th of <br/>
November and never felt anyone more thankful <br/>
to tread its soil again than myself.</p>

<p>The week after my arrival home <br/>
I spent in looking after my affairs and found them <br/>
in a bad condition. My house which I commenced <br/>
before I left and expected to find reared and with <br/>
its roof on I found built only a few feet from <br/>
the ground</p>

<p>On the 7th I attended Council <br/>
with the Twelve and was appointed with [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] as a committee <br/>
to raise five hundred dollars to purchase paper <br/>
to print the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.</p>

<p>Sealing of myself and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Wife]].</p>

<p>November the <strike>19</strike>^11^, 1843 [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] sealed the <br/>
marriage covenant of myself and wife Phebe W. Carter <br/>
for time and eternity</p>",
42828.0,437,,"<p>429</p>

<p><u>An</u> <u>Adulterer</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>saved</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Celestial</u> <u>Kingdom</u>.</p>

<p><u>According</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>Doctrine</u> <u>of</u> [[Joseph Smith Jr.|<u>Joseph</u>]] <u>the</u> <u>Prophet</u></p>

<p>In the High Council on the case of [[William Henry Harrison Sagers|Harrison Sagers]]<br/>
for improper conduct offered to a female Joseph in an address<br/>
said ""the Church has not received any license from him <br/>
to commit adultery fornication or any such thing but to <br/>
the contrary. If any man commits adultery he cannot<br/>
receive the celestial Kingdom of God. Even if he is saved <br/>
in any Kingdom it could not be in the Celestial Kingdom.""</p>

<p>He said he thought the many who had <br/>
been made examples such as [[John Cook Bennett|John C. Bennet]] and others<br/>
was sufficient to show the heineous fallacy of such conduct<br/>
He condemned it in unqualified terms and warned those <br/>
present against such evils or they would surely bring a <br/>
curse upon the heads of the guilty.</p>

<p>Joseph afterwards met with the Twelve<br/>
and he informed us that [[General Fryson|General Fryeson]] was in town and <br/>
wished an interview with us. He had come for the <br/>
purpose of getting a memorial on our belief written to Congress<br/>
Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] with the quorum of the Twelve <br/>
sat in Council with the General and there were read <br/>
to him the affidavits of Hyrum Smith [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]<br/>
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] [[George White Pitkin|George W. Pitkin]] and <br/>
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sid<strike>ey</strike> Rigdon]]</p>

<p>On the Sabbath morning Dec 2<sup>nd</sup><br/>
P. P. Pratt [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] Wilford Woodruff and [[Orson Spencer|O Spencer]]<br/>
received their anointings preparatory to further endowment</p>

<p>On the 7th a messenger arrived <br/>
from [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis]] informing us that the [[Thomas Reynolds|Governor]] of [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
has issued another writ for Joseph and that he was about <br/>
to make a demand for him of the [[Thomas Ford|governor]] of [[Illinois|Illinois]]</p>

<p>Joseph had just made a touching appeal <br/>
to the Green Mountain Boys of [[Vermont|Vermont]] for assistance<br/>
in obtaining redress of his wrongs in the persecution <br/>
in Missouri. We published it in pamplet form and </p>",
42828.0,438,,"<p>sent it to the authorities of the United States</p>

<p>The City Council <strike>was</strike> <strike>^and^</strike> called <strike>to</strike> ^and^ passed an <br/>
ordinance the purport of which was that anyone henceforth <br/>
who should come to take [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] on the old <br/>
Missourian difficulties should be imprisoned in the<br/>
city jail for life unless pardoned by the Governor <br/>
with the consent of the mayor. This was published <br/>
in an extra sheet of the Neighbours</p>

<p>A few days after this a man by <br/>
the name of Elliot one of the Missourian Kidnappers <br/>
who had ran bretheren out of [[Illinois|Illinois]] to [[Missouri|Missouri]]<br/>
and put them in prison was brought to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]<br/>
on a warrant and bound under 3000 dollars bonds <br/>
He was also under another warrant for threatening <br/>
the life of Joseph and the charge was proved <br/>
against him but the Prophet forgave him <br/>
and he was discharged. On the case of Joseph made <br/>
an eloquent speech manifesting mercy towards his <br/>
enemies when they were in his power but with <br/>
uplifted hands he declared that if Missouri <br/>
came against us any more he would fight them <br/>
and defend his rights</p>

<p>A warrant was also issued <br/>
against Col [[Levi Williams|Williams]] who was the leader of the <br/>
kidnapping affray but he had gathered around <br/>
him a mob and swore defiance so the officers <br/>
returned to Nauvoo for Counsel and assistance</p>

<p>On the 23rd At President Joseph Smith's <br/>
I wish my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] met with the quorum through <br/>
the day in the endowments. [[Isaac Morley|Brother]] and <br/>
Sister [[Lucy Gunn Morley|Morley]] [[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]] &amp; Sisters [[Permelia Darrow Lott|Lot]] [[Fanny Young Carr Murray|Fanny Murry]]<br/>
Phebe W. Woodruff [[Bathsheba Wilson Bigler Smith|Barsheba Smith]] [[Catherine Curtis Spencer|sister O Spencer]] &amp; [[Sally Waterman Phelps|Phelps]]<br/>
received their anointing.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards was Christmas <br/>
day A large party met at the Nauvoo Mansion <br/>
and had a splendid dinner and supper; but <br/>
I was invited by Elder [[Randolph Alexander|Alexander]] to meet at his <br/>
house with my family and spend the day with</p>",
42828.0,439,,"<p>431</p>

<p>the [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] Saints. I did so and there were with <br/>
us brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] and his family.</p>

<p>The farther duties of a few days more in <br/>
my official calling and in attending to my family affairs <br/>
and forwarding the building of my house brought <br/>
us to the close of the year</p>

commanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ to <br/>

then went into the Home of Elijah Fordham who <br/>
was at the point of Death, his friends had looked <br/>

was like the voice of God it seemed as though the whole <br/>
Home shook from its very foundation And the man <br/>
leaped from his bed &amp; was made whole instaneously <br/>
He kicked his pettiees off from his feet, dressed himself <br/>

very sick the prophet Healed him &amp; we knelt down &amp; pryd <br/>

me that there would be a great work in London<br/>
We retired to rest in good season.  I felt well in <br/>
my mind and slept untill about 12 oclok at night <br/>
I awoke and meditated upon the things of God untill<br/>
about 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a Determina-<br/>

the powers of darkness which were besetting us day by <br/>
day and trying to overcome us.  As I was forming <br/>

vibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the souls<br/>

<p>CHAPTER III.<br/>
Utah obtains an Historical Importance through her Commercial Men.</p>

<p>IT was the merchants of Utah who first brought the Mormon community fairly into socialistic importance. And this affirmation is true of them, both in their results at home and in the influence which they excercised abroad for the good of the people and the glory of Utah. Moreover, in the general sense of the public weal, this affirmation is as true of the Walker Brothers and Godbe and Lawrence, as it is of Jennings and Hooper or Elredge and Clawson. The very construction of society and the necessities and aims of commerce convert the enterprises and life work of this class of men into the public good. Over a quarter of a century, for instance, the Walker Brothers and Godbe and Lawrence have been identified with the material prosperity and destiny of this Territory. The welfare of the country is their own good as a class ;---the glory of the commonwealth glorifies their houses and augments their own fortunes. Of all men, the life-work and enterprise of the class who establish commerce, build railroads, develop the native mineral resources of the country, and construct the financial power of the State, must per force tend to the public prosperity as well as conserving and preserving society. And if this is the case with those influential men of commerce and great enterprises who have gone outside of the pale of the Church, yet are still identified with the community in all their essential interests, how much more, specially speaking, is it the case with those men who have remained inside the pale of the Church and built up her commercial and financial power? The Church owes to her apostles of commerce and finance more than many would like to confess ; and yet in this point of their extraordinary service to the Church is at once the significance and potency of ""Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution."" This will be strikingly illustrated in the circumstantial history of ""Z. C. M. I.,"" towards which we are traveling in these preperatory commercial views. <br/>
Often has it been told what the community has done for the merchants, and as often have those same merchants---who built up the commercial and financial power of the Church---been ungraciously twitted that they have made their money out of ""this people."" Let us look at the other side now, and ask something of what the merchants have done for the community, and what ""this people"" have made out of the merchants? And this line of review of our commercial history is very necessary to be understood insomuch as it will be suggestive of what the community already owe to the existence of ""Z. C. M. I."" And, furthermore, the remarkably successful example of that unique Institution during the last twelve years, under the united incorporation of these apostles temporal with the apostles spiritual, will foreshadow the vast results which the community will derive in the future in the growth and augmentation of the power and resources of said Institution.<br/>
A cursory view has been given of the destitute condition of the Mormon people during the first period of the settlement of these Valleys. As late as 1856, there was a famine in Utah, and the community was barely preserved by the leaders wisely rationing the whole and dividing among the people their own substance. But it was neither the economy and wisdom of the leaders, nor the plentiful harvests that followed, that redeemed Utah from the depths of her poverty, and the anomalous isolation of a people reared in lands of civilization and plenty. She was redeemed from her social destitution by a train of Providential circumstances on the one hand, and the extraordinary activities of her merchants on the other. As we have seen, the Providence came in a United States Army ; the temporary existence of Camp Floyd ; the departure of the troops, leaving their substance to the community; the needs of the Overland Mail line ; the construction of the telegraph lines ; and then again the arrival of another U. S. army under Colonel Connor, and the establishment of Camp Douglas with several thousand soldiers to disburse their money in Salt Lake City after their pay days, besides the constant supplies which the camp needed from our country, and often labor from our citizens.

<p>UTAH OBTAINS AN HISTORICAL IMPOR-<br/>
TANCE THROUGH HER COMMERCIAL<br/>
MEN.</p>

<p>IT was the merchants of Utah who first<br/>
brought the Mormon community<br/>
fairly into socialistic importance.  And <br/>
this affirmation is true of them, both in<br/>
their results at home and in the influence<br/>
which they exercised abroad for the good<br/>
of the people and the glory of Utah.<br/>
Moreover, in the general sense of the pub-<br/>
lic weal, this affirmation is as true of the <br/>
Walker Brothers and Godbe and Law-<br/>
rence, as it is of Jennings and Hooper or<br/>
Eldredge and Clawson.  The very con-<br/>
struction of society and the necessities<br/>
and aims of commerce convert the enter-<br/>
prises and life work of this class of men<br/>
into the public good.  Over a quarter of<br/>
a century, for instance, the Walker Broth-<br/>
ers and Godbe and Lawrence have been <br/>
identified with the material prosperity and<br/>
destiny of this Territory.  The welfare<br/>
of the country is their own good as a <br/>
class; --the glory of the commonwealth<br/>
glorifies their houses and augments their<br/>
own fortunes.  Of all men, the life-work<br/>
and enterprise of the class who establish<br/>
commerce, build railroads, develop the<br/>
native mineral resources of the country,<br/>
and construct the financial power of the<br/>
State, must per force tend to the public<br/>
prosperity as well as conserving and pre-<br/>
serving society.  And if this is the case<br/>
with those influential men of commerce<br/>
and great enterprises who have gone out-<br/>
side the pale of the Church, yet are still<br/>
identified with the community in all their<br/>
essential interests, how much more,<br/>
specially speaking, is it the case with those<br/>
men who have remained inside the pale<br/>
of the Church and built up her commer-<br/>
cial and financial power?  The Church<br/>
owes to her apostles of commerce and fin-<br/>
ance more than many would like to con-<br/>
fess; and yet in this point of their extra-<br/>
ordinary service to the Church is at once<br/>
the significance and potency of ""Zion's<br/>
Co-operative Mercantile Institution.""<br/>
This will be strikingly illustrated in the<br/>
circumstantial history of ""Z. C. M. I.,""<br/>
towards which we are traveling in these<br/>
preparatory commercial views.</p>

<p>Often has it been told what the com-<br/>
munity has done for the merchants, and<br/>
as often have those same merchants -- who<br/>
built up the commercial and financial<br/>
power of the Church--been ungraciously<br/>
twitted that they have made their money<br/>
out of ""this people.""  Let us look at<br/>
the other side now, and ask something<br/>
of what the merchants have done for the<br/>
community, and what ""this people""<br/>
have made out of the merchants?  And<br/>
this line of review of our commercial<br/>
history is very necessary to be under-<br/>
stood, insomuch as it will be suggestive<br/>
of what the community already owe to<br/>
the existence  of ""Z. C. M. I.""  And,<br/>
furthermore, the remarkably successful<br/>
example of that unique Institution dur-<br/>
ing the last twelve years, under the<br/>
united incorporation of these apostles<br/>
temporal with the apostles spiritual, will<br/>
foreshadow the vast results which the<br/>
community will derive in the future in<br/>
the growth and augmentation of the pow-<br/>
er and resources of said Institution.</p>

<p>A cursory view has been given of the <br/>
destitute condition of the Mormon peo-<br/>
ple during the first period of the settle-<br/>
ment of these Valleys.  As late as 1856,<br/>
there was famine in Utah, and the<br/>

<p>UTAH'S COMMERCE AND CO-OPERATION.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>THE INITIAL VIEW OF OUR COMMERCE.</p>

<p>THE history of Utah commerce is<br/>
very unique.  In some respects,<br/>
there is not a State or Territory in<br/>
America whose commercial history will<br/>
compare with that of our Territory.  Its<br/>
character has been as peculiar as its com-<br/>
monwealth, and that has given to it a<br/>
typing quite uncommon in it genius;<br/>
yet the typing in accord with the co-op-<br/>
erative policies which the age has de-<br/>
vised in solving the problem between<br/>
capital and labor.  There is also much<br/>
stirring romance in its history.  Its<br/>
story and incidents are almost as roman-<br/>
tic as the commerce of Arabia whose<br/>
mammoth caravans, in their journeys<br/>
acr ss the deserts, have given subject and<br/>
narrative to the most gorgeous romances<br/>
in the whole range of literature.  The<br/>
journeys of the trains of these merchants<br/>
of the West over the Rocky Mountains <br/>
and the vast arid plains between Salt<br/>
Lake City and the Eastern States, and<br/>
their arduous task and adventurous ex-<br/>
periences will fitly compare with the his-<br/>
tory of the merchants of the East in old-<br/>
en times when civilization herself was<br/>
fostered by commerce; and, moreover,<br/>
in the early days of Utah, it took as<br/>
much commercial courage, perseverance<br/>
and ability to establish the commerce of<br/>
this Territory as it did that of any na-<br/>
tion known in history.  On the very<br/>
face of the record, we may discern that<br/>
the men who did this work were no or-<br/>
dinary men.  They were capable of mak-<br/>
ing their mark in any land; and if Utah,<br/>
in the early days, afforded them great op-<br/>
portunities, it was their boundless ener-<br/>
gies and commercial ambitions that first<br/>
created those opportunities and made a<br/>
people comparatively affluent who had<br/>
been buried in isolation and in the<br/>
depths of poverty.  Thus considered,<br/>
45<br/>
the biographies of our commercial men<br/>
have a peculiar charm of interest which<br/>
gives a dignity to the personal record of<br/>
their lives far above that of the ordinary<br/>
history of self-made men and successful<br/>
financiers.  Indeed, the history of our<br/>
commercial men is substantially the his-<br/>
tory of Utah commerce.</p>

<p>But the initial exposition of Utah com-<br/>
merce is undoubtedly that derived from <br/>
her peculiar commonwealth, and the ex-<br/>
traordinary history of the Mormon peo-<br/>
ple who settled these valleys; and this<br/>
will lead us directly through various<br/>
phases of development to the commercial<br/>
culmination to be illustrated in ""Zion's<br/>
Co-operative Mercantile Institution.""<br/>
To type our commercial history for the<br/>
popular understanding, it may be de-<br/>
scribed as Israelitish; and so its char-<br/>
acteristic inscription of ""Holiness to the <br/>
Lord"" is neither fanciful nor presumptu-<br/>
ous, but fundamental and typical.  It<br/>
may be confessed that the inscription has<br/>
been often burlesqued by the ""Gentile;""<br/>
but the sociologist would quickly read in<br/>
it a volume concerning the genius and<br/>
commonwealth of a people expressed in<br/>
a gigantic commercial institution which,<br/>
in its vast activities, influence and special<br/>
methods, may become famous as the<br/>
greatest marvel in the history of modern<br/>
commerce.</p>

<p>And, just in this initial view, we must<br/>
keep in sight the men who founded the<br/>
Institution and especially those who are<br/>
the proper representatives of the com-<br/>
merce of the Mormon people.  It would<br/>
be a very false-sighted view to consider<br/>
""Z. C. M. I."" as a colossal commer-<br/>
cial monument of the Church apart from<br/>
those commercial founders.  That insti-<br/>
tution, in fine, is the organic embodi-<br/>
ment of the life-activities of such men as<br/>
William Jennings, William H. Hooper, <br/>
Horace S. Eldredge, Hyrum B. Clawson,<br/>
William C. Staines, Godbe and Mitchell</p>",

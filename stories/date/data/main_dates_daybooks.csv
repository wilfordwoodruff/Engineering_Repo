<br/>
<p>5th NOV Spent the day at Col [[Joseph W. Rowlett|Joseph Rowletts]] in reading A Book bearing this title PRINCIPLES OF NATURE <br/>
BY [[Elihu Palmer|ELIHU PALMER]] in 1806 third edition. Mr Palmer being a decided Deist his object in this work<br/>
was to overthrow the vailidty &amp; testimony of the scriptures or Prophet &amp; Apostles And after ende-<br/>
avouing to take the advantage by gathering together in one combined mass all the inconsistences, folies,<br/>
&amp; eviles af a sectarian generation &amp; heaping them upon the true Church of Christ When ther is no<br/>
more concord or connection between the two now than between the Pharasees, Sausees<br/>
Herodians, &amp; Christ &amp; the Apostles eighteen hundred years ago. He then says that the testimony<br/>
of Christ has failed &amp; not fulfilled according to his word &amp; for proof of his assertion he<br/>
voted the 24th Chapter of Math &amp; says that in that Chapter Christ prophesied that the fall of<br/>
Jerusalem The Comeing of Christ &amp; the end of the world Would take place in the gener<br/>
ation &amp; he declares it did not take place &amp; in consequence of this Mr Palmer makes the seceeping<br/>
conclusion that the Bible is fals &amp; Jesus Christ an imposter But let Mr Palmer hold<br/>
untill that the Prophesy is fulfilled according to the declaration of Jesus Christ &amp; all will be well<br/>
&amp; the world will feel the power of natuers God See Page 100 [FIGURE] Preached at Col<br/>

1836 that is Past. But who can tell whare the end of 1837 will leave him. Yea that important <br/>
year that is mounting the wheels of time to stand upon the stage of exhistance to do its <br/>
Perfect work. Will not its gigantic operations, &amp; its magna works stand upon the Archieves of <br/>
heaven as great events. Will this gentile generation still sleep in this late hour if so sleep on <br/>
&amp; take thy rest which is short for thy end is come &amp; the day is broke that Israel must be awoke <br/>
from his slumber for the last time &amp; Prepare himself for the [[Bridegroom|Bridegroom]] then let <br/>
1837 finish its work with speed &amp; let its departure say who is gone to the tomb. &amp; what <br/>

by the [[spirit of prophecy|spirit of Prophecy]] &amp; Revelation Some of them I will mention which are as <br/>
follows THAT my enemies would confine me in [[prisons|prisions]] &amp; chains &amp; that I should rend <br/>
the prisions &amp; chains in twain in the name of JESUS &amp; that the Lord would give me<br/>
Great Power, [[knowledge|Knowledge]], &amp; wisdom that I should [[heal the sick|heal the sick]] cause the [[blind|blind]] to see<br/>

myself from river to river from sea to sea &amp; that I should stand before Kings &amp;<br/>
Princes &amp; that they would send for me to receieve wisdom, Knowledge, &amp; <br/>
instruction at my mouth because they consider'd me wiser than they in like <br/>
manner as the Egyptians sought wisdom at the hand of [[Joseph (OT)|JOSEPH]] And that</p>

the truth of the above [[Proclamation|PROCLAMATION]] See May 29th 1836 in this Journal</p>

I Willford Woodruff being in the spirit on the eve of the 2nd Day of Jany AD 1836 mine understanding<br/>
was enlightened and mine eyes were opened to look within the veil and behold the things that are to<br/>
come, things which must yet be fulfilled. an angel said unto me look and I looked and beheld great<br/>
and marvelous things that are to transpire spedily many in this generation. I saw a Judgment that<br/>
doth await Babylon the great. I saw signs in the east as a warning to the nations and to fullfull the<br/>
Prophets III X II [FIGURES]<br/>
I beheld the sun turn to darknes and the Moon to Blood and the horizon covered with burning<br/>
Cities as is to come upon Babylon I saw seven golden Lions sit in the heavens as burning<br/>
brass but the meaning was taken from me. I saw the resurrection of the Celestial Kingdom<br/>
or the inhabitants theroff whose glory was that of the first born they were arayed in white<br/>
garment of fine lining most beautiful &amp; fair. I saw the resurrection of the Terrestrial Kingdom<br/>
whose glory was lesser than the Celestial. The earth hove from its capacious bed that Immor<br/>
-tality might rest upon them and they came forth out of their graces. Great peace, joy, happiness,<br/>
and glory immortality and Eternal Life reigned in the Celestial and Terrestrial Kingdoms<br/>
Great and marvelous were the things shown unto me while in the spirit I beheld a personage<br/>
appear in the Clouds of heaven and while looking at the greatness and majesty and the<br/>
story of these things the veil was closed from my view and I awoke and my rest was seel<br/>
unto me And if I cannot write all that I saw I testify that what I have written is true</p>",

you, and to be a Lawgiver unto my Church. He has mingled his <br/>
Blood with ^that of^ the Martyred prophets. Neverthless, while I have taken my servants<br/>
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] unto myself, I have preserved my servant John Taylor for<br/>
a wise purpose in me. I have also taken many others of the <strike>Twelve</strike> ^apostles^ unto<br/>
myself, for I take whom I will take &amp; preserve in life whom<br/>
I will preserve according to the Counsel of my ^own^ will. And while my servant <br/>
John Taylor is your president, I wish to ask the rest of my servants of the<br/>
Apostles the question, Although you have one to preside over your Quorum<br/>
^and over the Church^ which is the order of God in all Generations do you not all of you<br/>
hold the Apostleship which is the Highest Authority ever given to men on the<br/>
Earth? You do; therefore you hold ^in common^ the keys of the kingdom of God <strike>on the</strike><br/>
<strike>Earth is common</strike> in all the world. You each of you have power<br/>
to unlock the vail of Eternity &amp; hold converse with God, the Father, &amp; his son<br/>
Jesus Christ, and to have the Administration of Angels. It is your right<br/>
privilege &amp; Duty to Enquire of the Lord ^as to^ his Mind &amp; will concerning yourselves &amp;<br/>
the inhabitants of Zion &amp; their Interests, and whenever any one of you <br/>
receives the word of the Lord, let it be written and presented in your <br/>
Councils and whatever by united consent you deem wisdom <br/>
to be presented unto the people, let it be presented By ^the president^ My servant<br/>
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John <br/>
Taylor]] as the word of the Lord <strike>unto the people</strike> in this way you will <br/>
uphold him, and strengthen his hands as all the burden should not<br/>
lie upon one Man. For thus saith the Lord all ^of^ mine Apostles</p>",

This is one of the comforts in

I left Town in time to drive
to Doles where I put for the
night. On the way I stopped
to warm at Peeks and receieved
some very wholesome advice
to get be nighted somewhere
near Lyons for an excuse to
spend the night in company
with Miss Lyon his daughter
This was ingenious but as I could
not discover the propriety I rejected
the idea.
Early in the evening in attempting
to go to bed I got into the Kitchen

Jan 11th This morning find
Smith unsociable I left the Store
last night unlocked expecting his
return soon as he had gone
out while I was preparing to
go visiting. And did not mention
that he would be absent through
the evening. I left when I got
ready. He was in bed when
I returned and arose to let
me in chiding me for not telling
him that I was going away
Doubtless his mood to day originated
in this insident. he probably
either blames me for not telling
him that I was going out at the
same time that I had not been
in the store an hour during the
day or he thinks I blame
him for leaving without in time

Mr Mullen, an acquaintance was
kind enough to favor me with an
introduction to his sister to Miss
Lyon and to Miss McKinsley, by
which good fortune I was enabled 
to pass the night pleasantly
I returned to Town in the morning
highly gratified with an entertainment
which had cost me so little emb-
-arrasment and left me this side
up.
The evening of Jan 10th I spent
at Mrs Coles. Misses Catharine 
and Dorothea entertaining with
all possible good will. We told
each others fortunes. Played cards
talked sentiment, a little sense and
more nonsense concluded we liked
each other pretty well and
should be glad to see each other

more likely of sighs for hearts
And I am quite sure that one
sweet kiss from one of the fairest

I did not choose to dance
but one of my companions (it 
was William) that to trip the
fantastic toe with a Young Belle
of a neighboring Town and
accordingly we find our Young
Hero at a suitable time bowing
most obsequiously before the fair

Friday ensuing the first of Jan. 7
I went up to Doles. in company
with Horace Blinn, William
Warren and Smith to attend
a Ball in honor of the Glorious
Eighth. The company was large
and quite miscellaneous The 
object appeared to be. The great-
-est possible quantity of Amusement
estimated by the greatest gross
amount of dancing squeezed out
of the occasion, and it was
attained, for during the Twelve
hours I remained there. There 
was no cessation of hop skip
and jump excepting the hour
allotted to supper.
No hearts I believe were lost though
there was a good deal of flow of
soul. There might indeed have
been some exchanged made-",NA

In the course of the ensuing week
I changed my place of boarding to
the Table of my friend Mr Irish
I was induced to do so partly on accord
of my conveniencce, but mainly because
I was pleased with the dociety of the
family. My Irish did not wish
boarders but took me out of regard
for my wishes And perhaps be-
cause he did not choose to deny my
request He said ""there seems to 
be a perfect understanding between
you and Mrs Irish"" And I accepted 
of his a place at his Table because
I had then pressed the matter
to far to recede. I have since
regretting this step for I fancy
that I am considered as acting
upon the principle that ""It is
useless to have a friend unless we
use him.""",NA

New Year happened on Sunday
F. M. Irish came the the Store

was added another, still more surprising,
in the fact that Mr Smith my
partner offered to join us! And we
all went to the Court House and
heard Elder Bennett from N.Y.
but Alas poor Smith! he was
so stricken in conscience for his
presumption that he found no peace

was to overthrow the vailidty &amp; testimony of the scriptures or Prophet &amp; Apostles And after ende-
avouing to take the advantage by gathering together in one combined mass all the inconsistences, folies,
&amp; eviles af a sectarian generation &amp; heaping them upon the true Church of Christ When ther is no
more concord or connection between the two now than between the Pharasees, Sausees
Herodians, &amp; Christ &amp; the Apostles eighteen hundred years ago. He then says that the testimony
of Christ has failed &amp; not fulfilled according to his word &amp; for proof of his assertion he
voted the 24th Chapter of Math &amp; says that in that Chapter Christ prophesied that the fall of
Jerusalem The Comeing of Christ &amp; the end of the world Would take place in the gener
ation &amp; he declares it did not take place &amp; in consequence of this Mr Palmer makes the seceeping
conclusion that the Bible is fals &amp; Jesus Christ an imposter But let Mr Palmer hold
untill that the Prophesy is fulfilled according to the declaration of Jesus Christ &amp; all will be well

and marvelous things that are to transpire spedily many in this generation. I saw a Judgment that
doth await Babylon the great. I saw signs in the east as a warning to the nations and to fullfull the

I beheld the sun turn to darknes and the Moon to Blood and the horizon covered with burning
Cities as is to come upon Babylon I saw seven golden Lions sit in the heavens as burning

or the inhabitants theroff whose glory was that of the first born they were arayed in white
garment of fine lining most beautiful &amp; fair. I saw the resurrection of the Terrestrial Kingdom
whose glory was lesser than the Celestial. The earth hove from its capacious bed that Immor

and glory immortality and Eternal Life reigned in the Celestial and Terrestrial Kingdoms
Great and marvelous were the things shown unto me while in the spirit I beheld a personage

Though heaven and earth pass away, my words shall
not pass away, but shall be fulfilled, saith the Lord.

These revelations and testimonies are before
you. Let my Saints search the word of the Lord,
and treasure up wisdom, and be prepared for that
which is to come. As I have decreed, so shall
my judgments begin at the house of God. There
are those in my church who have a name among
you, who are adulterers and adulteresses, and those
who blaspheme my name, and those who love and
make a lie, and those who revel and drink with the
drunken. If they do not speedily repent of this
wickedness and abomination, they should be severed
from the ordinances of my house, saith the Lord.
There are many who have need to repent, whose lusts ^hearts^
are set upon the things of this world, who aspire to
the honors of men, and do not honor the priesthood,
nor seek to build up the kingdom of God, as they should.
Neither do they learn and comprehend that the rights
of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven can
not be controlled nor handled, only upon the prin-
ciples of righteousness. Such should repent and
turn unto the Lord, and seek for the Holy Spirit
to guide them. Judgments will begin upon
my house, and from thence will they go forth unto
the world, and the wicked cannot escape. Bles
sed are the pure in heart, for my blessings
await them in this life, and eternal life in the
